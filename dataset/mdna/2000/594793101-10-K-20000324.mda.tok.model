item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the communications  computer and industrial markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
with the company s acquisition of synergy semiconductor in november  the company broadened its standard product offerings to include high speed mixed signal and digital integrated circuits  which are primarily used in electronic products in the high bandwidth communications and computer markets 
the company s financial statements include the results of synergy semiconductor from the acquisition date forward 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  competitive pricing pressures  the successful development of new products  and the company s ability to ramp up manufacturing to meet increasing demand 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative purchased in process technology total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in due primarily to higher standard product revenues and  to a lesser extent  higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  high bandwidth communications products and computer peripheral devices 
such products were sold to manufacturers of communications  portable computing  computing peripherals and industrial products 
the increase in the standard high bandwidth product revenues results from the november acquisition of synergy semiconductor 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decline as a percent of total revenues reflects a reduced emphasis on custom and foundry products as compared to the same periods in  in which the company increased its emphasis on custom and foundry products as an interim response to the asian financial crisis 
the company believes that pricing pressures that were prevalent during and the first half of have lessened as customers become more concerned about product availability 
increasing end customer demand throughout has resulted in capacity constraints and increasing order lead times for semiconductor suppliers in general 
during the third and fourth quarters of  standard product customer order lead times slightly increased as compared to the same period in  but customer demand continues to be short term focused 
these factors limit forward visibility and affect the company s ability to predict future sales levels and profitability 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in due to higher standard product revenues and higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  computer peripheral ic components  dricers  and switching regulators 
such products were sold to manufacturers of portable computing  computing peripherals  telecommunications and industrial products 
during the company increased its emphasis on custom and foundry product sales as an interim response to the asian financial situation 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase in international sales resulted from shipments to manufacturers of personal computers and communications products and demand for the company s products primarily in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic  canadian and certain other international distributors until such distributors resell the company s products to their customers 
sales to stocking representatives and oem customers are recognized upon shipment 
the company estimates returns and warranty costs and provides an allowance as revenue is recognized 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the gross margin improved from the prior year level  which was depressed by the write off  in the fourth quarter of of approximately million in excess inventory in response to a reduced sales forecast of synergy products 
excluding the synergy inventory write off  gross margin for was 
in addition  the improvement in gross margin reflected an increase in manufacturing efficiency due to greater capacity utilization and reductions in contract assembly and test unit costs  which were partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the million fourth quarter write off of excess synergy inventory that was offset in part by an increase in manufacturing efficiency resulting from greater capacity utilization 
manufacturing yields  which affect gross margin  may from time to time decline because the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
factors such as minute impurities and difficulties in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of standard products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented for each of the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs associated with the acquisition of synergy and the development of new standard products 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new standard products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer fabrication  and increased expenses due to engineering staffing  design services  and prototype wafers to support the development of new standard products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase was principally attributable to higher wages and salaries  commissions  advertising and other administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s revenues 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase was due  in part  to increased wages and salaries  higher commissions  advertising and other sales and administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s revenues 
purchased in process technology 
on december   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of altos semiconductor for a cash purchase price of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the total purchase cost was allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded charges in the year ended december  the purchased in process technology related to four individual development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and  therefore  the successful completion of such projects was uncertain 
those development management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued projects correspond to temperature sensing devices 
at the time of the acquisition  further development remained on these projects and the estimated costs to complete were approximately  significant assumptions used to determine the value of in process technology included i forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the development effort  ii an estimate of percentage complete for each project which averaged for all projects  iii a discount rate of approximately

of that amount  approximately million was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded charges in the year ended december  the purchased in process technology related to approximately individual development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and  therefore  the successful completion of such projects was uncertain 
those development projects correspond to three existing product lines supercom  clockworks and logic 
significant assumptions used to determine the value of in process technology included i forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the development effort  ii an estimate of percentage complete for each project which ranged from to with an average for all projects of  iii a discount rate of approximately 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities partially offset by interest incurred on line of credit borrowings and term notes 
other income  net decreased  to  in from million in such decrease was due to an increase in average long term debt associated with the synergy acquisition 
the company expects to continue to utilize term financing as appropriate to finance its capital equipment needs 
other income  net increased by approximately  to million in from  in such increase reflected a  increase in interest income due to an increase in average cash and investment balances  partially offset by an increase in interest expense by  due to an increase in the average amount of notes payable 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was of income before tax excluding the  charge for purchased in process technology  which is a non deductible charge for federal income tax purposes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was of income before tax excluding the million charge for purchased in process technology 
the and income tax provisions differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes and the non deductible charges for purchased in process technology offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and borrowing facilities consisting of i million under a revolving line of credit  of which all was unused and available at december   and ii million under a non revolving line of credit of which million was unused and available at december  the two lines of credit are covered by the same loan and security agreement and expire march  and are subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the non revolving bank line of credit that is covered by the loan agreement described above  can be used to fund purchases of capital equipment whereby the company may borrow up to of the acquisition cost 
amounts borrowed under this credit line are automatically converted to four year installment notes 
all equipment notes are collateralized by substantially all of the company s manufacturing equipment and bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   a fixed rate based on the four year us treasury bill rate at december  plus or an annual adjustable rate based on the one year us treasury bill rate at december  plus 
on march   the loan agreements described above were subsequently replaced with a new loan and security agreement 
under the new agreement  the revolving line of credit remained at million and the non revolving line of credit was increased to million dollars 
the new agreement expires april  and is subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
borrowings under the new revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   or the bank s revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus 
borrowings under the new non revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   the bank s non revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus  a fixed rate based on the four year us treasury bill rate at december  plus or an annual adjustable rate based on the one year us treasury bill rate at december  plus 
all other terms and conditions remain substantially unchanged from the prior agreement 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under term notes that are collateralized by substantially all of the company s manufacturing equipment 
the company s working capital increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  accounts receivable of million  inventories of million  and decreases in other accrued liabilities of million which were partially offset by increases in income taxes payable of million  accounts payable of million  deferred income of million  and accrued compensation of million 
the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s cash flows provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased net income and income taxes payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the company s cash flows provided by operating activities in the year ended december  were primarily attributable to net income of million after adding back non cash activities  an million tax benefit from employee stock transactions combined with a million increase in income taxes payable  accounts payable of million  deferred income of million  and accrued compensation of million which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million which increased with higher revenues 
the company s investing activities during the year ended december  used cash of million as compared to million of cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of million of property  plant and equipment principally associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer production and additional wafer fab and testing equipment to increase production capacity  combined with net purchases of million of short term investments  and million for the purchase of altos semiconductor 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december  provided cash of approximately million as compared to cash provided of million during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity and proceeds from long term borrowings of million  which was partially offset by million net repayments of long term debt 
the company currently intends to spend up to approximately million during the next twelve months primarily for the purchase of additional wafer and test manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its existing credit facilities 
factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future revenue levels and income  statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expenditures  statements regarding the impact of year on the company  statements regarding year compliance costs  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operations and in the additional factors set forth below 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to timely acquire and install capital equipment to expand manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demand  availability of production capacity at assembly subcontractors  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s ability to hire and retain key technical and management personnel  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will continue to depend upon standard products sales 
as compared with the custom and foundry products business  the standard products business is characterized by shorter product lifecycles  greater pricing pressures  larger competitors and more rapid technological change 
generally  the standard products market is a rapidly changing market in which the company faces the risk that  as the market changes  its product offerings will become obsolete 
the company competes in the standard products market with established companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to compete successfully in the standard products market or that it will be able to successfully introduce new standard products in the future 
the failure of the company to compete successfully in the standard products business would materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors include product features  performance  price  timing of product introductions  emergence of new computer standards  quality and customer support 
because the standard products market for integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in its various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
due to the increasing demands for integrated circuits  the company expects intensified competition from existing integrated circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
there can be no assurance that these existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate the company s technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
historically  the company has not experienced significant individual product gross margin differences on export sales compared to domestic sales 
however  as a result of the foregoing international market risks or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material gross margin fluctuations in the future  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
readiness disclosure for year the year issue refers to whether computer systems will properly recognize two digit year values as the year versus the year systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
during the past year  the company has implemented a year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  suppliers and customers that are not year compliant  and to develop  implement and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant disruptions related to the year issue and has not been informed of any failures of the company s products related to the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities commercial paper with maturities of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures
