the company s services are performed on either a time and materials or fixed price basis 
the company expects that an increasing number of future projects will be fixed price rather than time and materials which has historically been the basis for its contracts 
revenues related to time and materials contracts are recognized as the service is performed 
revenues related to fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under such method  the sales value of performance  including earnings thereon  is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost 
estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses  to reflect changes in expected completion costs 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in the estimate becomes known 
additionally  any anticipated losses are recognized immediately 
since the company bears the risk of cost over runs and inflation associated with fixed price projects  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by changes in estimates of contract completion costs
