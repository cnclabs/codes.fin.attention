management estimates that cash balances of  at september   cash flow from operations and cash available from existing credit agreements will be sufficient to fund fiscal year normal operations 
cash balances are placed in short term investments until such time as needed

the company has consistently produced strong operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal operations 
strong operating cash flows are the result of stable operating margins and a high percentage of recurring service revenues  which require relatively low capital investment

in fiscal year  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission whereby the company can issue up to  of notes 
through september   the company has issued  of notes under this arrangement

market risks interest rates the automotive solutions portion of the business borrows money  as needed  primarily to fund business combinations 
generally the company borrows under fixed rate agreements with terms of ten years or less 
the financial services segment of the business obtains borrowings to fund the investment in finance receivables 
these fixed rate receivables have repayment terms of four to eight years  with five years being the most common term 
the company funds finance receivables with debt that has repayment terms consistent with the maturities of the finance receivables 
generally the company attempts to lock in the interest spread on the fixed rate finance receivables by borrowing under fixed rate agreements or using interest rate management agreements to manage variable interest rate exposure 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
because fixed rate finance receivables are primarily funded with fixed rate debt or its equivalent variable rate debt that has been fixed with interest rate swaps  management believes that a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the company s debt instruments and interest rate management agreements 
foreign currency exchange rates the company has foreign based operations  primarily in canada  which accounted for of net sales and revenues in in the conduct of its foreign operations  the company has intercompany sales  expenses and loans between the us and canada and may receive dividends denominated in different currencies 
these transactions expose the company to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

based on the company s overall foreign currency exchange rate exposure at september   management believes that a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial statements
