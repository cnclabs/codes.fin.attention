item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were incorporated in maryland in august as avail networks  inc and reincorporated in delaware in december as visual networks  inc from incorporation through december  our principal objective was to secure sufficient equity financing to enable us to accelerate product development efforts of visual uptime for frame relay deployment and to develop sales and marketing functions and general and administrative infrastructure 
visual uptime was first shipped in mid we began generating significant revenue from sales of visual uptime during  primarily to subscribers 
in august  we entered into a master reseller agreement with sprint  resulting in our products shipping through sprint to subscribers 
in october  we entered into a similar master reseller agreement with mci  which also resulted in shipments of our products through mci to subscribers 
during and  we focused on selling visual uptime directly to providers as part of their network infrastructure and visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark to internet service providers 
in december  we entered into an agreement with at t  which provides for the sale of our products to at t for deployment as part of at t s infrastructure 
during  we continued to focus on selling visual uptime  visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark 
we realize revenue from sales of hardware  from the licensing of related software and from maintenance contracts 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery of the product and passage of title to the customer 
where the agreements provide for evaluation or customer acceptance  we recognize revenue upon the completion of the evaluation process and acceptance of the product by the customer 
maintenance contracts call for us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
we recognize maintenance revenue  including maintenance revenue that is bundled with product sales  ratably over the contract period  which currently ranges from one to three years 
we currently contract with third party subcontract manufacturers for most of the assembly  testing and shipping of our products 
we anticipate maintaining a portion of our internal manufacturing function for the foreseeable future at our rockville  maryland facility 
on may   we acquired netnet in a merger accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on september   we acquired inverse in a merger accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the combinations with netnet and inverse will affect the future results of the operations reported by us 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with avesta technologies  inc to acquire all of their outstanding preferred and common stock 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business combination 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents for the periods indicated certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of our revenue year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative merger related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared with revenue 
we recognized million in revenue for  a increase over revenue of million for the increase was due primarily to the continued acceptance of visual uptime  visual ip insight  and visual internet benchmark products with an increase in sales to service providers  particularly at t and sprint 
sales to service providers accounted for approximately of revenue for as compared to approximately for gross profit 
cost of revenue consists of subcontracting costs  component parts  direct compensation costs  communication costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees and other overhead expenses related to manufacturing operations and to support our software products and benchmark services 
gross profit was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
gross margin was of revenue for  as compared to of revenue for the increase in gross margin percentage was due primarily to product cost reductions and to product sales mix 
our future gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including product mix  the proportion of sales to providers  competitive pricing  manufacturing volumes and an increase in the cost of component parts 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of compensation for research and development staff  depreciation of test and development equipment  certain software development costs and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expense was million for as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels and related support costs  and purchases of materials and services used in the development of new or enhanced products 
research and development expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we expect that research and development expenditures will increase in absolute dollars  and may continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue  during and thereafter 
the increase in absolute dollars will support continued development of new enhanced products and the exploration of new or complementary technologies 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists of compensation for the sales and marketing staff  commissions  pre sales support  travel and entertainment expense  trade shows and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expense was million for  as compared to million 
table of contents for  an increase of million 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels during the year and related commissions  and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we expect that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars  and may continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue  during and thereafter 
this increase in absolute dollars is expected to be incurred as additional personnel are hired  field offices are opened and promotional expenditures increase to allow us to increase market penetration and to pursue market opportunities 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists of the costs of finance  administration  and general management activities 
general and administrative expense was million for as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels  professional services and continued growth in corporate facilities and network infrastructure 
general and administrative expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we expect that general and administrative expenditures will increase in absolute dollars  and may continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue  during and thereafter 
the increase in absolute dollars is expected to be required for the expansion of our administrative staff and internal systems to support expanding operations 
merger related costs 
in connection with the inverse acquisition  we recorded merger related costs of approximately million 
transaction costs totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other direct transaction costs 
the remaining million in non recurring costs consisted primarily of the write off of certain assets as a result of the merger and the accrual of certain employee benefits to conform the policies of inverse with our policies 
in connection with the acquisition of netnet  we recorded merger related costs of approximately million 
transaction costs totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other direct transaction costs 
integration expenses totaled approximately million and consisted of incremental and non recurring costs necessary to integrate visual and netnet 
the remaining million was a restructuring charge that consisted primarily of the consolidation of visual and netnet s manufacturing  sales  marketing and administration functions as well as the discontinuance of certain netnet product development efforts 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  for was approximately million as compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily due to the increase in interest expense related to capital leases and other borrowings 
income taxes 
income taxes for were million  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differed from statutory rates due to the effect of certain non deductible merger related costs and the effect of our net operating loss carryforwards 
net income loss 
net income for was million as compared to a net loss of million for  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to increases in revenue and gross profit  which offset the increased operating and merger related expenses described above 
compared with revenue 
we recognized million in revenue for as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the continued acceptance of visual uptime  visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark products with an increase in sales to service providers 
sales to service providers accounted for approximately of revenue for compared to for gross profit 
gross profit was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
gross profit was for  as compared to for the increase in gross margin percentage was due primarily to product cost reductions and to the mix of product sales 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in research and development 
table of contents expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels and support costs  and purchases of materials and equipment used in the development of new or enhanced products 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense was and for and  respectively 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels and related commissions 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense was and for and  respectively

general and administrative expense was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to increased staffing levels 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense was and for and  respectively 
merger related costs 
in connection with the netnet acquisition  we recorded merger related charges for transaction costs  integration expenses and restructuring charges of approximately million 
transaction costs totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  and other direct transaction costs 
integration expenses totaled approximately million and consisted of incremental and non recurring costs necessary to integrate visual and netnet 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
in may  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million primarily in connection with the consolidation of visual and netnet s manufacturing  sales  marketing and administrative functions as well as the discontinuance of certain netnet product development efforts 
the consolidation included a reduction in employees that resulted in severance and other termination benefits including out placement assistance 
the remaining restructuring costs related primarily to the termination of contractual obligations  including leases and oem distribution agreements  with no future benefit 
during  approximately million was charged against the restructuring reserve 
this amount included approximately million related to employee termination costs and approximately million related to contractual obligations 
in december  we reversed the remaining million of the restructuring accrual 
the lower than estimated cost resulted from fewer than planned terminations and higher than planned attrition  along with lower than estimated costs associated with exiting certain contractual obligations 
as of december   all amounts due under contractual obligations were paid and all of the employee terminations were completed and the related benefits were paid 
net loss 
our net loss was million for  as compared to the net loss of million for  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due primarily to the revenue and gross profit increases described above offset by increased operating and merger related costs described above 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our combined balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was million as compared to million as of december  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for capital expenditures were approximately million for we require substantial working capital to fund our core business  particularly to finance inventories  accounts receivable  research and development activities and capital expenditures 
additionally  we require substantial working capital to support our acquisition strategy 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures for are not expected to exceed million 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products and market acceptance of our products 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  our other principal source of liquidity is our bank credit facility 
the credit facility includes a revolving line of credit providing for borrowings up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the credit facility as well as a million capital equipment line 
the agreement entitles silicon valley bank to a negative pledge of our inventory and 
table of contents accounts receivable 
the agreement contains restrictive financial covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions related to liquidity  profitability and net worth as well as restrictions related to acquisitions  dispositions of assets  distributions  and investments 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility 
substantially all of our product sales to date have been made to customers in the us we intend to increase its sales efforts in foreign markets 
we plan to sell our products to foreign customers at prices denominated in us dollars 
however  if the company commences selling material volumes of product to such customers at prices not denominated in us dollars  we intend to adopt a strategy to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next to months 
we may consider from time to time various financing alternatives and may seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing or to enter into strategic arrangements 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such financing alternatives will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
risk factors our success depends on service provider companies incorporating our product into their infrastructure 
network service companies have not typically offered products and services that enable their customers to measure and test the level of service they receive on their communications networks  and if these companies do not want to offer this type of service  our future revenues could be significantly lower than anticipated 
our leading sales and marketing strategy  which we refer to as the provider deployment model  depends on sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service provider companies for them to deploy as part of their network infrastructure 
for  sales to service providers represented approximately of total revenue 
although we expect that for a significant portion of our revenue will be attributable to sales of our products under the provider deployment model  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in persuading service provider companies to continue to adopt this model for visual uptime and visual ip insight 
we believe that the success of the provider deployment model depends on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including acceptance of and satisfaction with our systems by service provider companies and their customers  the realization of operating cost efficiencies when visual uptime and or visual ip insight is deployed  our ability to demonstrate the operational benefits of visual uptime and visual ip insight  the generation of demand for these systems from customers and support for the systems by the service provider companies sales forces  the competitive dynamics between service provider companies that provide communication networks for wide area use and the development of service for ip networks overall  our successful development of systems and products that address the requirements for systems deployed as part of a service provider company s infrastructure  the timing and successful completion of integration development work by service provider companies to incorporate our service management functionality into their operational infrastructure  and the absence of new technologies that make our products and systems obsolete before they become standardized in network systems 
the failure of our products to become an accepted part of the service provider companies service offerings or a slower than expected increase in the volume of sales by us to these companies would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our long sales cycle requires us to expend significant resources on potential sales opportunities that may never be consummated 
if we do not eventually generate additional revenue from our sales and marketing efforts  the expended resources and lack of increased revenues could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future business prospects depend on growing the sales of our products and services 
the provider deployment model under which we are emphasizing future sales is characterized by a long sales cycle to turn opportunities into sales 
the risks inherent in the long sales cycle for visual uptime and visual ip insight  many of which we have little or no control over  include service provider companies internal acceptance reviews  service provider companies budgetary constraints and technology assessment  service provider companies lengthy decision making processes  the attendant delays frequently associated with service provider companies internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  and the substantial commitment of capital from service provider companies 
sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight generally involve significant testing by and education of both service provider companies and their customers as well as a substantial commitment of our sales and marketing resources 
as a result  we may expend significant resources pursuing potential sales opportunities that will not be consummated 
even if the provider deployment model is implemented  curtailment or termination of service provider company marketing programs  decreases in service provider company capital budgets or reduction in the purchasing priority assigned to products such as visual uptime and visual ip insight  particularly if significant and unanticipated by us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of sprint  at t or mci as a customer could harm our business 
our provider deployment model depends predominantly on sales to service provider companies 
the loss of either sprint  at t or mci  which have historically provided a majority of our revenue  would result in a substantial loss of revenue that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  sprint  at t and mci accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
during  sprint  at t and mci accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
as our provider deployment model develops  this concentration should continue as our customer base will consist predominantly of service provider companies 
the concentration will be further increased upon the consummation of the pending merger between sprint and mci 
existing service provider company customers are not easily replaced because of the relatively few participants in that market 
high barriers to entry due to extraordinary capital requirements and the likelihood that mergers of existing providers may further reduce their number mean that replacing a significant network provider company customer will be even more difficult in the future 
furthermore  the small number of customers means that the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of our products to any one service provider company customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our anticipated dependence on sizable orders from a limited number of service provider companies will make the relationship between us and each service provider company critically important to our business 
as our relationships with these service provider companies evolve over time  we will make adjustments to product specifications  forecasts and delivery timetables in response to service provider company demands and expectations 
further  because none of our agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurance that the issuance of a purchase order will result in significant repeat business 
any inability to 
table of contents manage our service provider company relationships successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and we must adapt quickly to these changes to compete effectively 
the market for frame relay  atm and ip internet network services is characterized by rapid changes  including continuing advances in technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and preferences and changes in industry standards 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely fashion that accommodate these changes  we will likely lose customers and business which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new technologies or advances in techniques for network services or the integration of service level management functionality into other network hardware components could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that i visual uptime and or visual ip insight will continue to compete successfully  ii our future product offerings will keep pace with the technological changes implemented by our competitors  iii our products will satisfy evolving industry standards or preferences of existing or prospective customers  or iv we will be successful in developing and marketing products for any future technology 
failure to achieve any one of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on continued market acceptance of the ip technology and our ability to adapt to new network technologies that may develop 
because visual uptime is deployed predominantly on ip networks  our near term success will depend on the continued market acceptance of ip technology as a preferred networking solution 
if services for ip networking do not maintain widespread market acceptance  the market for our products will be substantially reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of additional products  there can be no assurance that we will complete the development of these or any future products in a timely fashion  that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products  that our future products will achieve market acceptance  or if market acceptance is achieved  that we will be able to maintain such acceptance for a significant period of time 
if we are unable to develop products on a timely basis that address changing customer needs and technologies  we may lose market share to competitors or be required to substantially increase development expenditures 
such an increase in research and development expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there also can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
the success of our business depends on the widespread adoption of the internet by business and consumers for e commerce and communications 
because our internet service management products and services are based on providing performance measurement and diagnostics for the internet and corporate ip networks  the internet must be widely adopted  in a timely manner  as a means of electronic commerce  or e commerce  and communications 
if this adoption should not occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because e commerce and communications over the internet are new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market and its sustainable growth rate 
in addition  we believe that the use of the internet for conducting business transactions could be hindered for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to security concerns including the potential for fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  including well publicized outages of popular web sites  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  
table of contents limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  delay in the development of enabling technologies or adoption of new standards  inability to integrate business applications with the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our internet performance measurement products and services 
the demand for our internet service management products and services could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that measuring and evaluating the performance of their networks is no longer important to their business 
the internet is a complex  heterogeneous network of communications networks with multiple operators and vendors supplying and managing the underlying infrastructure as well as connections to this infrastructure 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant e commerce quality of service problems for companies  the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure are continuously seeking to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies networks  demand for our products and services would likely decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
errors in our products or services could discourage customers and damage our reputation 
if our existing or future products or services contain errors that are not detected before shipment  we could experience a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increases in service or warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
products and services as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products and services until commercial shipments have commenced 
we face growing competition that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for service management systems for corporate ip networks and the internet is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition in this market to intensify in the future 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
many of these competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  and some have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than us  or devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of products 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
companies directly competing with visual uptime include adc telecommunications  inc kentrox division  adtran  inc  digital link corp  agilent technologies  inc  netscout systems  inc  
table of contents network associates  inc  paradyne corporation  sync research  inc  and telecommunications techniques corporation companies directly competing with visual ip insight include concord communications  inc  first sense software  inc  ganymede software  inc  agilent technologies  inc  lucent technologies  inc ins insoft division  micromuse  inc  mdis group plc jyra research  inc nextpoint networks  inc  and response networks  inc companies directly competing with visual internet benchmark include freshwater software  inc  internet resources group  keynote software  inc  and exodus communications  inc service metrics division we expect that we may experience competition from less expensive products and services that provide only a portion of the functionality provided by our products and services 
in particular  as prices for network equipment components such as dsu csus decrease  customers may decide to purchase these less expensive products even though they lack certain features offered by our products 
for example  we expect that participants with strong capabilities in these various segments could partner with each other to offer products that supply functionality approaching that provided by visual uptime 
we are aware of such arrangements between digital link and netscout  and netscout and paradyne 
the success of such products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we expand the scope of our products and services  we may encounter many additional  market specific competitors 
these potential competitors include companies that sell network management software such as lucent technologies  inc onevision division and telecordia technologies  inc  each of which has announced products that could potentially compete with us in the future 
the success of such products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and we may not be profitable in the future 
our limited history  operating losses and accumulated deficit make predicting our future operating results difficult 
we were organized in and introduced visual uptime in mid accordingly  we have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our product and prospects can be based 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we reported net income of million for  we incurred consolidated net losses in and of approximately million and million  respectively 
the loss in related primarily to our expenditures associated with the development and marketing of the visual uptime product  the products of netnet and the 
table of contents products of inverse 
the loss in related primarily to the effect of the merger related costs and the effect of the netnet and inverse operating losses prior to the respective dates of acquisition 
our revenue may not continue to grow or be sustained in the future 
although we have recently experienced an increase in revenue from service provider companies  such growth should not be considered indicative of future revenue growth  if any  or of future operating results 
our revenue in any period depends primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the period  which are difficult to predict 
our expense levels are based  in part  on the expectation of future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations due to delays associated with customers decision making processes or for any other reason  operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations may be affected disproportionately by a reduction in revenue because a large portion of our expenses are fixed and cannot be easily reduced without adversely affecting our business 
in addition  we currently intend to increase funding of research and product development efforts and sales  marketing and customer support operations and to expand distribution channels 
to the extent such expenses precede or are not promptly followed by increased revenue  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers makes the price we pay for important components in our products more volatile 
we purchase many key components used in the manufacture of our products only from sole or limited sources 
if a sole or limited source supplier raises their prices  delays shipments or becomes unable or unwilling to supply a key component  we may be forced to obtain these components from alternative sources if they are available which could impair our ability to deliver our products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner  or could force us to increase our prices or reduce our gross profit margins 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and could jeopardize our relationships with those customers 
the risks associated with being dependant on sole or limited source suppliers of key components include the following we have not identified alternative suppliers for all of our key components and we may not be able to find alternative suppliers  if necessary  or find alternative components of comparable quality  we will have to qualify alternative suppliers before we purchase components from them which will  even if successful  necessarily delay the process of procuring the replacement components  most of our suppliers do not have long term agreements with us  so these suppliers could suddenly increase component prices  even minor delays in shipments of key components from suppliers which we have experienced in the past could delay the shipment of our products  although all of our sole or limited source suppliers are based in the united states  some of them may manufacture or acquire components from outside of the united states and thus they may be unable to deliver their components if their own supplies are interrupted by events in other countries  and some of the components  including dynamic random access memories and embedded communications processors  are subject to significant price fluctuations 
sole source components presently include framers  certain semiconductors  embedded communications processors  communication controllers and line interface components 

table of contents we may face difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with channel partners of our products and services and our customers  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition 
our failure to successfully assimilate companies acquired by us in the future and the occurrence of unanticipated costs that may arise in connection with such acquisitions  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we expand our international activities  our business will be susceptible to additional risks associated with international operations 
we believe we must expand the sales and marketing activities for our products and services outside the united states and hire additional international personnel 
therefore  we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities  which were less than of our consolidated revenue for and prior periods 
with respect to the visual internet benchmark product  we intend to deploy additional measurement computers worldwide  which would require us to maintain and service computers over longer distances 
conducting international operations would subject us to risks we do not face in the united states 
these include  but are not limited to currency exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
the internet and other ip services  such as frame relay and atm  may not be used as widely in other countries and the adoption of public data service for transporting mission critical applications may evolve slowly or may not evolve at all 
as a result  we may not be successful in selling our products and services to customers in markets outside the united states 
failure to expand our international activities successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key people could jeopardize our growth prospects 
the loss of the services of our president and chief executive officer or any other key employee could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the 
table of contents continuing contributions of our key management and technical employees  particularly scott e 
stouffer  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
our inability to hire and retain employees may hurt our growth prospects 
if we fail to hire and retain personnel  it could damage our ability to grow and expand our business 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  customer support and product development personnel 
intense competition for technically trained sales and product development personnel makes recruiting qualified personnel difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
others may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
if others claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  whether the claims are valid or not  we may be forced to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products or acquire licenses to the claimant s intellectual property 
we expect that these claims may become more common as the number of products in the network management industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps 
if a claimant is successful in a lawsuit arising from such a claim  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property rights 
our success is dependent on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we hold three patents and also rely on copyright and trade secret laws  trademarks  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these protection methods may not be adequate to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors that develop functionally equivalent technology 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  regardless of its success or failure  could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
we may be subject to additional risk as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or enforced effectively 
legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  and technology developed or used in such countries may not be protectable in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it more difficult for another individual or company to acquire control of our company  even if a change of control would benefit our stockholders 
these terms include our board of directors  without stockholder approval  may issue up to  shares of preferred stock on terms that they determine 
this preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms that delay or prevent the change in control of our company  make removal of management more difficult or depress the price of our stock  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the 
table of contents person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner  our board of directors is staggered so that only a portion of its members are elected each year  only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president or stockholders holding a majority of our stock can call special stockholder meetings  and special procedures must be followed in order for stockholders to present proposals at stockholder meetings 
in addition  our credit facility with silicon valley bank prohibits us from engaging in a merger with or being acquired by another entity without their consent  unless we are the surviving entity
