we caution investors that our business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
the open market and in block transactions over a two year period 
the program is subject to market conditions as well as other investment options that we may consider to enhance shareholder value 
during the six months ended june   we repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program 
we announced in april the launch of a surgical glove line  the profeel r brand  through a newly created surgical product division  epic surgical 
these new surgical products have synergy with out present customer base and allow our sales force to increase their call point and create new growth opportunities in a related and significant market sector 
the profeel r surgical glove line utilizes an advanced technology that provides outstanding tactile sensitivity which maximizes functionality in the surgical suite 
we anticipate sales of our surgical gloves to commence in october in july  we announced our partnership with owens minor  inc through an enhanced logistics agreement as well as an e commerce strategic alliance  called emedexpress 
we believe that this partnership should expand our market share through more efficient warehousing and distribution and through an e commerce platform

we are continuing to evaluate and investigate new products to compliment our glove product line 
we have plans to develop and introduce other new products in the near future  including dry wipe towels and possibly other infection control and safety products 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
six months ended for the year ended june  december  statement of operations data net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income  net provision for benefit from income taxes minority interest in loss income of subsidiary net loss from discontinued operations net income six months ended june  compared to the six months ended june  the company s net sales are derived from the sales of finished product  net of allowable rebates  discounts and returns 
net sales include glove sales from ahpc s glove product line and exam glove sales from pt buana  exclusive of its sales to ahpc 
net sales for the six months ended june  were  which represents a sales growth over the comparable period with net sales of  the increase in net sales is attributed to an increase in external sales by pt buana  our indonesian manufacturing plant  a better than expected retention of glove sales from the novation contract medical facilities after its expiration in april  as well as an increase in the amerinet group purchasing organization and foodservice product sales  which commenced in the third quarter of additionally  the six month period included a nonrecurring sales reduction of approximately million associated with a change to an inventory consignment arrangement with a major foodservice customer 
cost of goods sold includes all costs to manufacture and purchase the finished product plus the related costs associated with ocean freight  customs duty and warehousing 
cost of goods sold decreased from  for the six month period ended june  to  for the six months ended june  as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for the six months ended june  to for the six months ended june   the gross profit percentage increased from in the first half of to in the same period of the company s gross profit margin was favorably impacted by reduced glove purchase prices  improved manufacturing margins obtained from full capacity operating efficiencies at pt buana during the first half of  and a more favorable product mix  offset by lower selling prices 
the company continues to expect its gross margins to be affected by the price of latex  changes in product mix  competition  manufacturing capacity levels and other factors 
selling expenses include all salaries and payroll related costs for sales and marketing staff together with other sales related expenses such as sales commissions  travel costs  trade shows  advertising  promotions and delivery costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by from  for the six months ended june  to  for the six months ended june  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased from for the six months ended june  to for the six months ended june  this increase of  in sg a expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in selling compensation related costs of  associated with the expansion of our sales force 
we made an investment in our sales force in to support our expansion plans 
because of the loss of the novation contract  we are strategically planning and evaluating our manpower needs to maximize sales productivity per sales representative 
we also incurred increased selling expenses from higher levels of advertising  marketing  promotions and tradeshow costs of  as well as travel costs which increased by  there was also an increase in depreciation expense of  associated with our computer system placed in service in income from operations decreased by from  for the six months ended june  to  for the six months ended june  operating margins decreased from in the period to in the period 
for the six months ended june  and  ebitda was  and  respectively 
interest expense increased in the first half of to  compared to  in the first half of this increase is attributable to increased line of credit borrowings in the second half of used to finance increased inventory levels 
other income consists of rental income  interest income and miscellaneous income 
other income decreased by  from the first half of compared to the first half of this decrease is due to the expiration in of all rental leases and subleases associated with previous executive offices 
we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of  in the first half of versus a foreign exchange gain of  in the comparable period in  from our indonesian subsidiary  pt buana 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate and depending upon the mix of assets and liabilities in pt buana s books in indonesian rupiah  an exchange gain or loss will be incurred 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are reported as a component of the sg a expense category in the consolidated statements of operations 
pt buana continues to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and may incur exchange gains or losses in the future 
indonesia continues to be exposed to economic and political instability  which is characterized with fluctuations in its foreign currency exchange rate  interest rates  stock market and inflation rate 
our financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from these uncertainties and any related effects will be reported in the financial statements as they become known and estimable 
the provision for income taxes for the six months ended june  and was  and  respectively 
this decline in income tax expense of  is primarily due to a reduction of pre tax income generated in the us during the first half of compared to the same period in also  pt buana recorded deferred tax assets during the first half of associated with its prior period tax losses and recorded a tax benefit of  during the period 
in addition  we were able to utilize prior year net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately  during the six months ended june  and lastly  pt buana recorded a significant income tax expense of  during the first half of as a result of the indonesian rupiah strengthening against the us dollar  which created a large unrealized foreign currency gain on pt buana s tax reporting rupiah financial statements 
due to this additional income tax expense  the effective tax rate in the first half of is greater than us statutory corporate income tax rates 
at june   we had nol s of approximately million  which will be available to reduce future us federal taxable income 
for the six months ended june   net income for the company was  compared to net income of  in the same period of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended june  and were and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the results of operations for and include only the revenue and expenses of the glove business 
net sales include glove sales from ahpc s examination glove product line and external exam glove sales from pt buana 
net sales totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase represents less than a increase in glove sales in over sales for the year ended december  were reduced by million as we changed to a consignment inventory arrangement with a key food service customer in the second quarter 
the medical division experienced average sale price reductions of during due to a sharp decline in the price of raw material latex and competitive forces 
the medical division experienced a increase in case volume over and product mix continues to reflect increased powder free latex and synthetic glove sales 
cost of goods sold increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in the primary factors associated with the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales were lower average selling prices  increased warehousing costs associated with higher inventory levels  the change to consignment inventory and increased ocean freight rates  partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin powder free glove sales and reductions in glove purchase prices from manufacturers 
as a result of the above factors  our gross profit decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during the third quarter of  the indonesian factory  pt buana  completed its installation of chlorination equipment used for the manufacturing of latex powder free gloves  which produce a higher gross profit margin than powdered gloves 
pt buana produced only a small quantity of powder free gloves in the second half of  as it was selling its product on a trial basis in the european market prior to selling to the us market 
the domestic market for exam gloves is converting from latex powdered to latex powder free gloves and to synthetic gloves 
this move is a result of greater user receptivity to powder free gloves 
the chlorination process used to make powder free gloves reduces the protein content in latex and eliminates the powder  which also carries proteins 
due to customer demand  we are providing and selling more latex powder free exam gloves and synthetic gloves 
we expect that this trend will continue 
our sales of latex powder free exam gloves and synthetic gloves were approximately of sales in versus in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by from  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to in compared with in this increase of  in sg a expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in selling compensation related costs of  due to the planned expansion of our telesales and medical sales force  additional travel  telephone and sample expense of  associated with the larger sales staff and an increase in depreciation expense and consulting fees of  associated with our recently implemented computer system 
income from operations decreased by from  for to  for operating margins decreased from in the period to in the period 
interest expense decreased from  during to  in this decrease in interest expense of  is due to i approximately million of pt buana s debt having been repaid in as indonesian interest rates were very high and ii our new debt agreement entered into on december  carries a lower rate than the previous debt facility  offset by increased borrowings in on the line of credit used to finance its increased inventory levels and capital expenditures 
the pt buana debt repayments were made with our proceeds from the sale of common stock to wrp asia on march  all inter company interest income and interest expense is eliminated in consolidation 
other income consists of rental income  interest income and miscellaneous income 
other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the comparable period in this decrease in other income of  is primarily due to the disposal of the investment in lsai in  which generated a gain of  the provision for income taxes increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the income tax provision is less than the us statutory rates 
during the first quarter of  we had net operating loss carry forwards nol s which were used to reduce taxable income for that period 
in accordance with tax regulations  usage of the nol s is subject to limitations if certain ownership changes occur 
due to the wrp asia ownership change on march   our nol s became limited and subsequent to that date  we began recording a provision for income taxes 
at december   we had nol s of approximately million  which will be available to reduce federal taxable income in the us in future periods not to exceed approximately million per year 
the minority interest in loss income of subsidiary represents the non owned profit or loss from pt buana 
the minority interest in loss income of pt buana was  during compared to  in during  pt buana s profitability decreased primarily due to the reductions in its gross profit triggered by lower selling prices for powdered latex exam gloves in the marketplace as well as due to reduced production output 
net income decreased by  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended due to the previously mentioned factors 
the diluted earnings per share was 
in compared to 
in year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the results of operations for and include only the revenue and expenses of the glove business 
the discontinued operations of the playboy r condom business are reflected in the net loss from discontinued operations as separate line items in the consolidated statements of operations 
net sales include glove sales from ahpc s examination glove product line and external powdered exam gloves sales from pt buana 
net sales totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase represents a increase in glove sales in over this increase is attributable to ahpc s more developed customer relationships and increased pt buana sales to external customers  the introduction of new products  growth in markets for its products and a shift in the product mix toward higher priced products  particularly powder free exam gloves 
revenues from the playboy r condom business were  for the year ended december  these revenues are included in the net loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
under our exit plan  we sold playboy r condoms through june  cost of goods sold increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in this reduction in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales and improvement in the gross profit margin is attributed to i more favorable glove purchase prices obtained in due to a continued reduction in raw material latex prices  ii an increase in sales of higher profit margin glove products  particularly powder free examination gloves  iii improved operating efficiency in the indonesian facility  and iv reduced duty importation fees associated with examination gloves in as a result of the above  gross profit increased by from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the market for exam gloves is converting from latex powdered to latex powder free gloves and to non latex gloves 
being customer driven  we are providing and selling more latex powder free exam gloves and expect that this trend will continue in the future 
our sales of latex powder free exam gloves were approximately of net sales in versus in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased from  in to  in the increase is attributable to an increase in ahpc s delivery and selling expenses commensurate with its sales growth and the expansion of our sales force 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to compared with in we currently expect to make additional investments in sales and marketing to further develop established markets and to introduce new products to the marketplace 
prior to july   the financial statements and transactions of pt buana were maintained in the functional currency  indonesian rupiahs  and translated into us dollars 
due to our business and operating facility in indonesia  we experienced transaction and translation gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and shareholders equity was translated at historical exchange rates 
revenues and expenses were translated at the average exchange rate for each period 
translation adjustments  which result from the process of translating indonesian rupiahs into us dollars  were accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
such adjustments were unrealized 
effective july   in accordance with statement no 
 pt buana changed its functional currency for financial statements reporting purposes from the indonesian rupiah to the us dollar 
the net effect of this change in functional currency resulted in a positive  foreign currency translation adjustment by pt buana which is recorded in as a component of cost of goods sold 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease is attributable to the repayment of all of pt buana s debt in the funds for these debt payments were primarily from the proceeds from our sale of common stock to wrp asia on march  other income increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the disposal of the investments in lsai which generated a gain of  in we did not record income taxes in due to net operating loss carryforwards nol s which were generated in prior years 
during  the wrp asia ownership change limited to nol s which are available to reduce taxable income in current and future years 
because of these nol limitations  we began recording a provision for income taxes in we did not record any taxes to be paid for our foreign subsidiary in indonesia pt buana 
pt buana  based on indonesian tax reporting  has generated losses and thus has no current tax provision 
as a result  we have generated tax nol s in indonesia that can be utilized in the future 
during  we have also reviewed the adequacy of the valuation allowance it had recorded for deferred tax assets that were generated during the current and prior years 
as a result of this assessment and our continued profitability  we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax valuation allowance of  this amount has been reflected as a reduction in the tax provision 
the income tax provision recorded in of  is less than statutory rates due to the utilization of nol s in and to the reduction of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which was recorded in at december  we had nol s of approximately million which will be available to reduce federal taxable income in the us in future periods  subject to limitations 
for the year ended december   our net income was  compared to a net income of  in the overall diluted earnings per share was 
in compared to 
in segment information six month period ended june  and years ended december  and during the six month period ended june  and during the years ended december  and  we were engaged solely in the business of manufacturing and distributing disposable gloves 
we have two business segments  manufacturing and distribution 
these segments are managed as separate strategic business units 
the manufacturing segment  which represents the indonesian operations of pt buana  manufactures powdered and powder free latex gloves and sells them primarily to ahpc and wrp asia 
the distribution segment involves the procurement and sale of gloves purchased from the manufacturing segment and other glove manufacturers and then sold to national and regional healthcare  foodservice  retail and other distributors within the us the operations of the distribution segment are located entirely within the us year ended december  at december   we were in the business of manufacturing and distributing examination gloves in the us we also distributed playboy r condoms through june  in accordance with the termination agreement with playboy r enterprises inc as such  the playboy r condom business is reported as a discontinued operation 
liquidity and capital resources six months ended june  cash and cash equivalents at june  was  an increase of  from  at december  we experienced an increase in cash flows in the first half of primarily from cash provided by operating activities  offset by uses of cash in financing and investing activities 
our operations generated cash of  during the first half of as a result of net income of  plus non cash depreciation of  and a decline in inventories and accounts receivable  offset by net reductions in the amount owed to our majority shareholder  wrp asia 
net trade accounts receivable at june  decreased by to  from  at december  this decline of  is primarily due to a record sales month in december as customers were preparing for the year rollover and any unknown events associated with it  as well as to a reduction in may and june sales caused by the loss of the novation contract which expired on april  net inventories at june  decreased by to  from  at december  this decline of  is primarily due to the reduction in novaplus brand inventory levels associated with the loss of the novation group purchasing organization supply contract 
during the six months ended june   the cash generated from operations was used primarily for debt repayments 
we used cash in financing activities of  during the first half of comprised of net reductions on notes payable and line of credit debt of  and for repurchasing  shares of our common stock totaling  under our stock repurchase program 
during the six months ended june   we used cash in net investing activities of  we spent  for capital expenditures during the first six months of primarily at pt buana  our indonesian manufacturing plant  for capital improvements 
on december   we obtained a domestic three year credit facility from ge capital  a large commercial credit company 
this asset based lending loan and security agreement included a  revolving line of credit with a  letter of credit subfacility 
on march   we amended our loan and security agreement by increasing the maximum credit loan limit from  to  as part of the amendment  the letter of credit subfacility was increased from  to  the line of credit borrowings carry an interest rate of commercial paper plus at june  
at june   we had outstanding  on the revolving line of credit and  of letter of credit liabilities under the credit facility 
in october  pursuant to two debenture and warrant purchase agreements between us and two trusts affiliated with one of our directors  we issued  and each trust purchased  a convertible subordinated debenture in the amount of  payable in seven years with interest at over the prime rate 
each debenture is convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in addition  each trust received a warrant exercisable over five years to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at june  the total outstanding debt associated with these debentures was  during the six months ended june   we repaid  against this debt 
we anticipate repayments of  within the next twelve months and have classified  of this debt as long term at june  we currently expect to have cash needs during the second half of and beyond  in addition to funding the growth of the existing glove business 
these cash needs may arise in connection with various events such as for i the expansion into new products such as surgical gloves  ii paying off debt obligations  particularly the remaining long term debt  iii the hiring of additional marketing staff  iv the hiring of additional support staff  v the expansion of the manufacturing facility in indonesia  vi purchasing our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program  and vii possible acquisitions 
we believe that our cash and cash generated form future operations plus our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations 
year ended december  cash and cash equivalents at december  decreased  from december  levels 
we experiences this decline in cash flow in due to cash used in operations  the funding of capital expenditures and net repayments of letter of credit obligations 
our operations used cash of  in as a result of an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and amounts due from affiliate  offset by net income of  and non cash depreciation expenses of  in  we used cash of  for the purchase of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were made in for the acquisition of  of manufacturing equipment by pt buana primarily to product latex powder free exam gloves and by ahpc of  primarily to install and implement a new enterprise wide computer system 
we experienced increased cash flow from financing activities of  the generation of cash for financing purposes was from net borrowings on the line of credit facility of  offset by net reductions in letter of credit obligations 
net inventories at december  increased to  compared with  at december  due to the addition of several inventory product lines 
net trade accounts receivable at december  increased by to  from  at december  due to a record sales month in december and a strong collection effort made at the end of year in preparation for the rollover to the year  we initiated a year readiness project  the scope of which included the following steps ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on mainframe  personal computer  local area network and wide area network platforms  addressing issues related to non it imbedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of key suppliers and customers 
we did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in our operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   we do not expect any significant impact to our ongoing business operations as a result of the year issue 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be forseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise or that we will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not year compliant 
we are currently not aware of any significant year or similar problem that may have arisen with our key customers  suppliers or other significant third parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of investments 
we have not entered into interest rate caps or collars or other hedging instruments 
exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under revolving credit and debt agreements  which have variable interest rates tied to the prime and commercial paper rates 
we estimate that the fair value of each debt instrument approximated its market value at june  we are subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah vis a vis the us dollar 
the investment in the indonesian subsidiary is remeasured into the us dollar and the book value of the assets and liabilities of our indonesian operation at june  approximated its fair value 
for the six month period ended june   the foreign exchange loss included in the determination of net income was approximately  risks affecting forward looking statements and stock prices in addition to those matters already set forth in item  business and this item  the following may result in us not achieving certain results included in any statement that may be considered a forward looking statement 
we caution the reader that the following risks may not be exhaustive 
variations in quarterly results 
our quarterly operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including risks and uncertainties related to local and international political and economic conditions  foreign currency volatility  competitive pressures  the composition  timing and size of orders from and shipments to major customers  variations in product mix and the size mix between sales  variations in product cost  infrastructure costs  obsolescence of inventory  and other factors as discussed below 
accordingly  our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter 
we operate with little backlog and  as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on the orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur as expected  our operating results may be adversely affected and may fall significantly short of expectations 
any other unanticipated decline in the growth rate of our net revenues  without a corresponding and timely reduction in the growth of operating expenses  could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
we aim to prudently control our operating expenses 
however  there is no assurance that  in the event of any revenue  gross margin or other shortfall in a quarter  we will be able to control expenses sufficiently to meet profitability objectives for the quarter 
financing 
our current credit facility expires in december there can be no assurances that it will be renewed  extended or sufficient to finance continued growth of the company 
dependence on gloves 
we are currently almost exclusively engaged in the manufacture and sale of disposable gloves 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the level of supply of and demand for disposable gloves 
there can be no assurance that the supply of or demand for disposable gloves will continue at current levels or that changes in such supply or such demand will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
it addition  we currently have a supply contract with an unrelated malaysian glove manufacturing company for the purchase of powdered gloves 
should the demand for powdered gloves continue to decline  we will continue to be subject to the aforementioned commitments or  if such commitments cannot be fulfilled  we will be subject to certain penalty provisions within the supply contract 
dependence on rubber harvest and latex concentrate 
our ability to produce and purchase our products profitably is entirely dependent upon the consistent availability  at competitive prices  of raw rubber harvested by independent growers in malaysia  thailand and indonesia and locally processed by us and others into latex concentrate 
any disruption in the consistent supply of rubber for latex concentrate due to weather or other natural phenomena  labor or transportation stoppages  shortages or other factors  could cause significant adverse effects to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  rubber is a commodity traded on world commodities exchanges and is subject to price fluctuations driven by changing market conditions over which we have no control 
increases in the price of latex concentrate have adversely affected our raw material costs in the past and could continue to do so 
asia pacific risk factors 
social  political and economic instability may be significantly greater in many of the asian pacific countries than that typically associated with the united states and other industrialized countries 
varying degrees of social  political and economic instability could significantly disrupt the source of our supply of glove products 
currencies of several asian pacific countries  including indonesia  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and thailand have experienced significant fluctuations against the us dollar 
our indonesian factory maintains its books in the indonesian currency  the rupiah  and reports its indonesian income taxes with rupiah financial reports 
the indonesian rupiah experienced volatile currency fluctuations against the us dollar which caused significant income tax adjustments in foreign currency exchange volatility may continue and could cause us to incur significant income tax adjustments in the future 
in the past  interest rates in many asian pacific countries have risen sharply and credit availability was reduced 
companies in these countries  with significant indebtedness or costs denominated in foreign currencies that have appreciated in relation to the local currency  may have difficulty passing on increased local currency costs to their customers and may face financial difficulties and losses and may be unable to meet their obligations 
the economics of most asian pacific companies are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partners  principally  the united states  japan  china and the european union 
the enactment by the united states or other principal trading partners of protectionist trade legislation  reduction of foreign investment in the local economies and general declines in the international securities markets could have a significant adverse effect upon the economies of the asian pacific countries 
governments in certain of the asian pacific countries participate to a significant degree  through ownership interests or regulation  in their respective economies 
action by these governments could have a significant adverse effect on the economies of such countries 
changes in gross margins 
certain of our net product sales are derived from products and markets which typically have lower gross margins compared to other products and markets  due to higher costs and or lower prices associated with the lower gross margin products and markets 
we currently expect that our net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves will continue to increase as a percentage of total net product sales 
in addition  we are currently experiencing pricing pressures due to a number of factors  including competitive conditions  consolidation within certain groups of suppliers  excess supply of products  changing technologies in the production of powder free gloves and increasing demand for new glove products 
additionally  we may not be able to pass on price increases to our customers in a timely manner  or at all 
to the extent that these factors continue  our gross margins could decline  which would adversely affect us and our future operating results 
downward pressure on our gross margins may be mitigated by other factors  such as a reduction in product costs and or an increased percentage of new product sales from higher gross margin products  such as powder free and synthetic gloves 
we are aiming to reduce our product costs and to increase our percentage of net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
new products 
we are planning to distribute new glove products  including surgical gloves 
we may begin to distribute other safety and infection control products besides gloves 
there is no assurance that these development efforts will be successful or that  if successfully developed  these products will achieve commercial success 
growth dependencies 
in general  our future growth is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  establish new distribution channels  develop affiliations with leading market participants and continue to develop our relationships with our existing customer base 
the failure to achieve these and other objectives could limit future growth and have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
in addition  the pressure to develop and enhance products and to establish and expand markets may cause our sg a expenses to increase substantially  which could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
manufacturing in indonesia international operations 
our international manufacturing operation has grown substantially and  thus  we are increasingly affected by the risks associated with international operations 
such risks include managing an organization in indonesia  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the burden of complying with international laws and other regulatory and product certification requirements  changes in such laws and requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  import and export controls  international staffing and employment issues  and political and economic stability 
the inability to effectively control and manage these and other risks could adversely affect us and our future operating results 
competition 
the various markets in which we operate are becoming increasingly competitive as a number of other companies develop and sell products that compete with our products in these markets 
certain of these competitors have significantly more financial and technical resources than us 
we face additional competitive factors besides price  such as product quality  timeliness of delivery  service and the size and reliability of the manufacturer 
these competitive factors may result in  among other things  price discounts by us and sales lost by us to competitors that may adversely affect us and our future operating results 
reliance upon distributors 
we use various channels to market and distribute our products primarily by sales to end users via third party distributors 
third party distributors are a substantial channel for distribution to medical facilities 
accordingly  our ability to market and distribute our products depends significantly on our relationship with third party distributors  as well as the performance and financial condition of these distributors 
in the event that our relationship with these distributors deteriorates or the performance or financial condition of the distributor becomes unsatisfactory  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
reliance upon significant contracts and customers 
a significant portion of our acute care and medical division business has been obtained through the achievement of being selected to supply group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks idn s in the us these group purchasing organizations and idn s  made up of a few or thousands of health care facilities  centralize medical product purchases and offer its members the ability to enjoy larger purchasing powder discounts than an individual hospital or member might enjoy independently 
we reported in early that the group purchasing organization  novation  did not renew its supply contract with ahpc  which expired in april our sales of novaplus products to novation members accounted for over half of our sales in we have converted about of novaplus accounts to our branded products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to maintain this business 
our inability to retain a significant portion of this business could materially adversely affect our sales  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  during the six months ended june   two of ahpc s customers accounted for of net sales 
the loss of either of such customers would have a materially adverse effect on us and our operating results 
excess or obsolete inventory 
managing our inventory of various size mix and product mix is a complex task 
a number of factors  including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain sizes or products which are in short supply or which must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing  the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules  may result in us maintaining excess inventory 
other factors  including changes in market demand and technology  may cause inventory to become obsolete 
any excess or obsolete inventory could result in price reductions and inventory write downs  which  in turn  could adversely affect us and our operating results 
hiring and retention of employees 
our continued growth and success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled business  technical  marketing and other personnel is intense  particularly in the strong economic cycle currently prevailing in the us the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs in order to compete for skilled employees 
product liability insurance 
participants in the medical supplies business are potentially subject to lawsuits alleging product liability  many of which involve significant damage claims and defense costs 
a successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
claims made against us  regardless of their merit  could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation 
there is no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policy will be adequate or that present levels of coverage will be available at affordable rates in the future 
while we have been able to obtain product liability insurance in the past  such insurance varies in cost  is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits filed against us and other manufacturers 
this litigation is still in the early stages and there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to meet any recovery for which we may be found liable  that the outcome of such suits will not materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition  or that our deductible obligation to fund a portion of the initial cost of defense and or liability of each such lawsuit will not prove financially burdensome 
stock market fluctuations 
in recent years  the stock market in general  including our common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in our revenue growth rates  the loss of a significant customer or sales contract  changes in earnings estimates by market analysis  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  the inability of the market to absorb selling pressure from one or more large institutional shareholders  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future
