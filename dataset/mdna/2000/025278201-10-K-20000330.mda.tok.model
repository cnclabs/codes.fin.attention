asset portfolio review at december   the company s total assets of million was comprised of the following cash and investments   reinsurance recoverables   premiums receivable   deferred expenses policy acquisition costs and deferred taxes  fixed assets   and other assets  the company generally invests in securities with fixed maturities with the objective of providing reasonable returns while limiting liquidity and credit risk 
as a result  its investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income debt securities which are rated as investment grade with a carrying value of million and constituting of the company s fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  the company s fixed asset maturity securities included mortgage backed bonds of million and million  respectively  which are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments can cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss  while securities that have an amortized cost less than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in gain or yield 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
at december   the following table provides a profile of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio by rating amount market percent of s p moody s rating value portfolio aaa aaa including us treasuries of   aa aa  a a  bbb ba  all other  total  the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging  enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio  or reducing the cost of its debt obligations 
the company employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets 
the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market 
credit risk is addressed through adequate diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities 
reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues  and through asset liability matching practices 
purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities  which have variable principal prepayment options  are generally avoided 
market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity 
the combination of these investment management tenets generally provides a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration 
the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive  however  to fluctuations in the level of interest rates  but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments 
the impact of interest rates movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold 
with a market value of approximately million  the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of years and an indicated duration of this implies that a basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately  or million 
these possible declines in values for bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common stockholders equity at any point in time  but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level 
liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  the company receives cash principally through fees and dividends from subsidiaries and borrowings  certain of which are subject to dividend restrictions and regulatory approval 
the ability of insurance companies to underwrite insurance is based on maintaining liquidity and capital resources sufficient to pay claims and expenses as they become due 
the primary sources of liquidity for american country are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income  commissions and fee income  and proceeds from the sales and maturities of portfolio investments 
the principal expenditures are for payment of losses and lae  operating expenses  commissions and dividends to stockholders 
the company believes its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
the company maintains a liquid operating position and follows investment guidelines that are intended to provide acceptable return on investment while preserving capital  maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations and maintaining a sufficient margin of capital and surplus to ensure american country s unimpaired ability to write insurance 
cash flow generated from operations for the year ended december  and was million and  respectively  which amounts were adequate to meet all obligations during the periods 
the increase in cash flow for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily related to the increase in premiums and to an increase in loss reserves 
on july   the company obtained a million revolving loan credit facility under which it borrowed million at an initial rate of based upon libor  payable quarterly  to fund a portion of the million paid in connection with the acquisition 
on april  the company negotiated a million revolving line of credit facility with a new lender bearing a maturity date of april  interest on the borrowings under the facility may be based on the prime rate minus one percent  eurodollar loan or the federal funds rate 
at december   the unused portion of the line of credit was million 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding line of credit for was 
total interest expense in and was  and  respectively 
repayment of this debt is expected to be funded by dividends from the operating subsidiaries 
on october   the board of directors approved a loan proposal from northern trust wherein the line of credit was converted to an million four year term loan and a million day revolving credit 
under the million term loan  the first installment of million is due april  the interest rate on the term loan may be based upon libor  the new york federal funds rate  or the prime rate minus 
the million revolving credit agreement has a maturity of days  with a commitment fee of 
per annum on the unused portion 
the line of credit agreement contains various debt covenants including conditions for prepayment and certain financial covenants  the most restrictive covenant being the ratio of debt to equity 
american country was in compliance with all covenants of the agreement as of december  income taxes the company s federal income tax returns for all periods prior to the acquisition were consolidated with those of its former owner 
income tax expenses were computed on a separate company basis 
for the period april   through july   american country and financial services filed a consolidated return with its previous parent  american country holdings corp 
effective with the acquisition on july   the company files a consolidated return with its subsidiaries  and accordingly the company has executed a tax sharing agreement  which requires the subsidiaries to pay the company amounts equal to the federal income tax that would be payable if the subsidiaries filed on a stand alone basis 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the current temporary differences will reverse during the periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
there are  however  no assurances that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning strategies could be implemented to supplement income from operations to fully utilize recorded tax benefits 
regulation in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the naic and individual states have enacted certain laws and financial statement changes 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specific corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level or  with negative trend 
the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for american country were in excess of their required amounts at both december  and the naic recently completed its process of recodifying statutory accounting practices codification  the result of which is the only source of prescribed statutory accounting practices after adoption by the state of domicile 
it is expected that codification will be adopted by the state of illinois and be implemented in  which will likely change  to some extent  prescribed  statutory accounting practices  and may result in changes in the company s insurance subsidiary s statutory surplus 
the purpose of these regulatory efforts at all levels is to improve the solvency of insurers 
these regulatory initiatives  and the overall focus on solvency  may intensify the restructuring and consolidation of the insurance industry 
while the impact of these regulatory efforts on the company s operations cannot be quantified until enacted  the company believes it will be adequately capitalized to compete in an environment of more stringent regulation 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  american country attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  american country may be limited in raising its premiums commensurate with anticipated inflation  in which event american country  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on american country s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on american country s investment income
