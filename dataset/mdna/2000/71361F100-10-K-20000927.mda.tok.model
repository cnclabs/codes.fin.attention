the company s current principal products are based upon proprietary three dimensional image processing and feature extraction software algorithms combined with two distinct three dimensional object imaging technologies tricam tm and lasar tm 
tricam tm technology uses structured laser light triangulation techniques to obtain accurate three dimensional measurements 
tricam tm systems are used to measure formed parts for reduction of process variation  to provide robot guidance sensing for automated assembly tasks and to improve the speed and lower the cost of wheel alignment final assembly operations 
tricam tm is also used by the forest products business unit to measure three dimensional shapes of trees  logs  boards and by products 
lasar tm provides accurate three dimensional measurements of a full scene over a larger field of view than does tricam tm 
the lasar tm product is used by the forest products business unit for the three dimensional measurement of stems  logs and cants 
the company has two business segments the automotive business segment and the industrial businesses segment 
the company s automotive business segment has sold its products primarily to north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian and south american automobile manufacturers 
historically  sales to automotive customers have typically depended primarily on new model re tooling programs 
accordingly  sales may vary significantly among customers on a year to year and quarter to quarter basis 
the company s industrial businesses segment was formed in fiscal year and includes the forest products business unit and the emerging markets business unit 
the forest products business unit has sold its products primarily to north american sawmills  sawmill machinery manufacturers and systems integrators 
the emerging markets business unit was formed during the first quarter of fiscal year and focuses on the steel blast furnace inspection and digitizing markets

outlook 
revenues in all of the company s business units are expected to strengthen during fiscal year  with the exception of the north american automotive business unit 
in the company s industrial businesses segment  customers response to new product offerings  such as the ultrasound based grading systems and mill wide optimization solutions offered by the forest products business unit  has been enthusiastic 
in europe the high level of new orders that have recently been awarded or are pending final approval provides a solid base to start the new year 
the three year outlook for the automotive industry is good  however  new tooling programs in north america for the model year are down compared with the model year 
as a result  sales of the company s core in line gauging systems for the next twelve months are not expected to be as strong as in fiscal because the company intends to continue its commitment to developing new products and global markets to support a healthy three year outlook  if current pressures on margins related to competition continues  the company is unlikely to attain the level of profitability attained in fiscal the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including those described under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement  below

for a discussion of certain contingencies relating to the company s financial position and results of operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contingencies 
euro conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legacy currencies and the euro were established as of that date 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january  but not later than july  
during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legacy currency 
conversion to the euro may reduce the amount of the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  due to the netting effect of having assets and liabilities denominated in a single currency as opposed to the various legacy currencies 
conversely  because there will be less diversity in the company s exposure to foreign currencies  movements in the euro s value in us dollars could have a more pronounced effect  whether positive or negative  on the company 
market risk information perceptron s primary market risks are related to foreign exchange rates and interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings 
the foreign exchange risk is derived from sales by its international operations  which are primarily located in germany and the netherlands and for which products are produced in the us at june   the company did not have any market risk instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk the company has limited foreign currency exchange risk in its international operations due to the percentage of contracts entered into in us dollars and the short time period between sales commitment and delivery for contracts in the non us currencies 
the company s percentage of sales commitments in non us dollars at june  was 
for sales commitments entered into in the non us currencies  the currency rate risk exposure is predominantly less than one year with the majority in the to day range 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations euro conversion 
the company may use  from time to time  a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
as the company exports products  it may enter into limited hedging transactions relating to the accounts receivable arising as a result of such shipment 
these transactions involve the use of forward contracts 
at june   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under its variable rate revolving line of credit and from fixed rate debt assumed in conjunction with the purchase of ultrasound intellectual property in october however  this risk is limited due to the limited level of debt the company has outstanding 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in the prime rate and changes in eurodollar rates in the london interbank market 
see note of notes to consolidated statements for a description of the company s outstanding debt 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb delayed the implementation date making the statement effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires recognition of all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  measured at fair value and sets forth conditions in which a derivative instrument may be designated as a hedge 
the statement requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to be recorded to other comprehensive income or to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings 
the company may  from time to time  engage in hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
management does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company is required to adopt sab by the fourth quarter of fiscal retroactive to july  and is awaiting interpretive guidance  not yet issued by the sec  to complete its assessment of the impact sab may have on the company s financial statements 
safe harbor statement certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  including the company s expectation as to fiscal year and future revenue  order booking levels and earnings levels  the timing of new product releases and the expansion of the company into new markets 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the dependence of the company s revenue on a number of sizable orders from a small number of customers  the timing of orders and shipments which can cause the company to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual revenue and operating results  timely receipt of required supplies and components which could result in delays in anticipated shipments  general product demand and market acceptance risks  the ability of the company to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies  the timing and continuation of the automotive industry s retooling programs  the ability of the company to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies  the ability of the company to identify and satisfy market needs  general product development and commercialization difficulties  the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel  especially technical personnel  the quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future  the level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in new products and technologies generally  rapid or unexpected technological changes and the effect of economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in the domestic and worldwide automotive and forest products industries  both of which have from time to time been subject to cyclical downturns due to the level of demand for  or supply of  the products produced by companies in these industries
