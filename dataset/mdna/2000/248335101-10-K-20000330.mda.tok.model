the company s financial statements are prepared in dollars  and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates in the pound sterling and other currencies in which the company does business relative to the dollar may cause fluctuations in reported financial information  which are not necessarily related to the company s operations 
in  for example  the company experienced a increase in net sales in the european region denominated in local currencies  however  the dollar translated net sales figures showed a net increase due to the fluctuation of the dollar against the local currencies of 
due to the volatility of currency exchange rates  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
although the company currently engages in transactions to hedge a portion of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  it may not do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations or that any hedging techniques implemented by the company will be effective
