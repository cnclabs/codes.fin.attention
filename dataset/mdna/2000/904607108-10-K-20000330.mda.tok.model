item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments

crusader s statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  an increase of  over december  crusader s statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  an increase of  over december  cash flow from operations for the year ended december   was  a decrease of  from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income of  a decrease in the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  a decrease in the change in loss reserves net of reinsurance recoverable of  and a decrease in the change in premium  notes and investment income receivable of  these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in the unearned premium reserve  net of prepaid reinsurance premiums of  there are no material commitments for capital expenditures as of the date of this report 
year subsequent to december   the company has not experienced adverse effects as a result of year issues from either internal or external sources 
however  due to the unusual nature of the problem and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty if there may be other computer or infrastructure problems which may occur and affect the company and its customers or suppliers 
due to the fact that the company has not experienced any adverse effects of year issues through the date of this report  the company does not anticipate it will be materially adversely affected by any future year events from its internal operations or from others with whom the company directly or indirectly does business 
results of operations general the company had net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before taxes decreased by  and net income decreased by  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
for the year ended december   income before taxes increased by  and net income increased by  compared to the year ended december  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader and an increase in investment income of  excluding realized investment gains 
the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the year ended december   was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium    earned premium before reinsurance    earned premium net of reinsurance    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for both fiscal years ended december  and crusader s gross written premium by state is as follows year ended december california    washington    arizona    oregon    pennsylvania    ohio    montana   texas   kentucky   nevada    total gross written premium    in the year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  compared to the year ended december  intense price competition in the property casualty insurance market has adversely affected the premium written in nearly all states that the company does business 
the increase in written premium in the states of kentucky  montana and pennsylvania was not sufficient to offset the decrease in the other states in which the company writes business 
in  the company changed its marketing strategy in the states of washington and oregon by discontinuing marketing through an exclusive agent in those states and commenced marketing directly to all retail agents and brokers 
the company anticipated that this change would result in a short term decrease in written premium with long term benefits of increased revenues with reduced acquisition expense and less dependency on any one large producer 
because intense price competition during and continued to adversely affect written premium in those states  the company cannot determine how much of the decrease in written premium was applicable to the change in marketing strategy  but still anticipates a long term benefit from the change 
the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement and actual results may differ materially 
factors that would cause the results to differ include economic conditions in the states of washington and oregon  willingness of retail agents and brokers to deal directly with the company and competitive conditions 
although the company attempts to be competitive on price  it believes that maintaining adequate rates and a favorable loss ratio is a better business strategy than increasing premiums at inadequate rates 
the validity of this strategy is reflected by the continued profitable loss ratio discussed below 
the company cannot determine how long this soft market condition will continue 
in order to grow its premium in this soft market  the company is attempting to increase its activities in its existing states by new marketing and incentive programs and by offering new and improved products to its agents and brokers 
the company s geographical expansion plan is based on cloning its california business in other states with similar demographics and legal regulatory environments 
the company s business package program has been written in california since it began writing business in  and it has proved to be successful 
when the company enters a new state  it initially does so on a limited basis in terms of agent contracts  products  and premium 
as the company develops experience in those states  it then places an emphasis on growth by expanding products and distribution activity 
currently  agents and brokers who call for quotes on policies sold by the company may also have to call competitors for quotes on products which the company does not offer 
thus  crusader competes with not only other insurance companies  but with general agents who produce business for other insurance companies 
many of these general agents offer more products than the company and thus make it easier for the agents and brokers because they can do more business with fewer telephone calls 
to provide better service to the company s agents and brokers  the company is currently working on additional non affiliated insurance company products to be offered by its general agency operations 
in addition to generating additional commission and fee income  the expansion of the general agency operation should benefit crusader because more agents and brokers may do business with the company 
in the year ended december   gross written premium decreased  compared to the year ended december  this decrease in written premium was primarily due to a decrease in premiums written in the states of oregon and washington of  and represented of the total decrease 
this decrease in premium in washington and oregon  as previously discussed  resulted from the company s change in its marketing strategy in these states to reduce its dependency on a single large producer 
in addition  the intense price competition in the marketplace has contributed to a reduction in premium in all states that the company writes business

earned premium ceded increased  to  or of earned premium before reinsurance in the year ended december   compared to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december  earned premium ceded decreased  to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december   compared to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december  ceded premiums increased in the year ended december   primarily due to higher than anticipated loss experience on prior accident years that was subject to the company s provisionally rated reinsurance contract 
premium ceded under this contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustments based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
the decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium in and was primarily due to decreased earned premium before reinsurance 
the following table shows the changes in ceded premium year ended december increase decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    increase in provisionally rated ceded premium    net increase decrease in earned ceded premium    the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses to net premiums earned the loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition and general operating costs to net premiums earned the expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as shown on the table  the loss ratio increased to in from in this increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to a decrease in favorable loss development due to an increase in the prior years losses incurred in  which was greater than the prior years losses experienced in favorable loss development of prior year losses were  in   in  and  in the methodology used by the company in determining case reserves and ibnr is consistent with prior years 
in addition  the increase in provisionally rated earned ceded premium in over of  also contributed to the increase in loss ratio 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and  consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost   short term cash investments at cost   equity securities at cost   certificates of deposit over year at cost   total invested assets   the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
since inception of the company  only nine bonds have been sold prior to their maturity or call date 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements are unrealized  and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized losses net of unrealized gains before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio was  as of december   the company s unrealized gain net of unrealized losses was  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities are sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk 
due to the company s small investment in equity securities approximately one half of one percent of total invested assets  the company has only minimal exposure to equity price risk
