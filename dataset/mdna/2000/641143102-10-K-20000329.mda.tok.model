financial information presentation as described previously  see business background acquisition of matrix telecom on december   we acquired matrix telecom through a share for share exchange of common stock 
the share exchange 
for accounting purposes  the share exchange was treated as a reverse acquisition of netlojix by matrix telecom 
even though we were the legal acquirer  the historical financial statements are required to be prepared as if matrix telecom acquired netlojix 
consequently  the following discussion of results of operations reflects the operations of matrix telecom prior to december  and reflects the combined operations of netlojix and matrix telecom subsequent to december  references to the company or our financial statements and financial information refer to operations of matrix telecom prior to the share exchange and the combined operations of matrix telecom and netlojix subsequent to the share exchange 
the reverse acquisition of netlojix by matrix telecom was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in order to value the consideration given in the share exchange  the market price of netlojix s common stock for a period immediately preceding the announcement of the share exchange was used 
as of the date of acquisition  we determined the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
the underlying fair value of our net assets was substantially less than the indicated market value of our common and preferred stock 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to income of million immediately subsequent to the reverse acquisition 
in august  we decided to exit the residential long distance business and focus exclusively on business customers 
as of august  matrix telecom was engaged in the residential long distance telephone business and represented all of the company s business in this segment 
consequently  effective with the execution of a definitive agreement the measurement date  the residential long distance operations of matrix telecom have been reflected as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
all prior year financial information has been restated to conform to the discontinued operations presentation 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues from continuing operations increased million or to for the year ended december  as compared to million for approximately million of the increase is attributable to acquisitions that were completed late in in september we acquired dmi and in november we acquired remote lojix 
the acquisitions contributed a full year of operations in compared with a partial year in we did not complete any acquisitions during as we concentrated our efforts on integrating our acquisitions 
as a result  we anticipate revenue growth to come solely from organic or internal expansion of our business segments and future acquisitions 
network connectivity segment during we derived of our revenues from network connectivity services versus in segment revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  within the network connectivity segment  data and voice services accounted for million of the increase with the balance of the increase attributable to internet services 
data and voice services revenue increased in over as the company significantly expanded its sales force during the increase was attributable to an increase of million in dedicated access and an increase in billable revenue minutes to million minutes from million minutes  a increase 
the increase in call traffic was partially offset by a decline in billing rates per minute 
our average rate per minute during was cents compared to cents per minute in or a decline 
the decrease in per minute rates is attributable to continued competitive pricing pressures within the telecommunications industry 
we believe that the downward competitive pressure on long distance rates will continue to adversely effect our revenues and gross margins for our traditional long distance products 
internet connectivity services revenues increased to million 
demand for internet connectivity in the central california area continues to be strong with customer attrition rates running below industry averages at about per month 
the increase in revenues is attributable to dedicated internet access products which include frame relay  cable  isdn and dsl 
our dedicated internet access customer base increased over in as compared to we believe that demand for broadband internet access products will continue to be strong 
we have upgraded our product offerings through partnerships and alliances with major vendors so that we can continue to increase our focus on broadband products 
technical support services segment technical support services revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million in in november  we acquired remote lojix which started our technical support services 
therefore the results represent two months of operating activity as opposed to months in application development and hosting segment application development and hosting segment revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during we recorded a  management fee relating to the acquisition of dmi 
excluding the one time management fee  revenues for this segment grew by million or over 
the increase is primarily attributable to applications services that were acquired in the dmi acquisition in september gross margin gross margin on continuing operations as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  total gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in total revenues  with the balance attributable to increase in gross margin for several segments as described below 
network connectivity segment the network connectivity segment recorded a gross margin of during compared to a gross margin for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was attributable to an increase in the gross margins on our data and voice products 
data and voice gross margins averaged during compared with in during  the company received a credit from its major vendor of million relating to prior periods network service costs 
excluding the effect of the one time credit  the company s gross margins for data and voice services would have been 
effective february   we negotiated significantly lower rates with our major underlying carrier for dedicated traffic 
the improvement in gross margins was partially offset by the re negotiation of a major customer contract which resulted in lower retail business rates 
the lower rates were effective with august traffic and extend through october gross margins for internet services continue to be strong averaging during compared with for technical support segment technical support services gross margins averaged during the year ended december  compared with during during salaries expense for technical service employees increased which adversely effected margins 
we expect margins will continue to be under pressure as the projected demand for it professionals is expected to outweigh the supply 
we are anticipating increasing retail prices in response to the increased demand for it professionals 
application development and hosting segment application development and hosting gross margins were during compared with for the decrease in gross margin is due to the  management fee relating to the acquisition of dmi recorded in and the increase in applications development projects within this segment 
gross margins for applications development projects are negotiated on a project by project basis and tend to fluctuate for each project depending on the total dollar amount  deadline commitments and specialized expertise that may be required for a particular project 
total gross profit increased to million from 
million in selling  general  and administrative costs selling  general  and administrative costs from continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions of dmi and remote lojix which were completed late in the acquisitions contributed a full year of operations in compared with a partial year in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative costs decreased to for year ended december  from for approximately million of the increase is due to increased legal and professional fees  primarily due to the class action lawsuit 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative costs was associated with expanded sales force and related expenses including salaries  general office expense  rent  utilities and travel expenditures 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased goodwill amortization related to the purchase of remote lojix during the fourth quarter of discontinued operations as noted earlier  in august  we decided to exit the residential long distance business and focus exclusively on business customers 
consequently  effective with the execution of a definitive agreement  the residential long distance operations of matrix telecom have been reflected as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements 
all historical years have been restated to conform to the discontinued operations presentation 
loss from operations of our discontinued residential long distance business was million for the year ended december  compared with a loss of million the loss included a tax benefit of million 
the tax benefit resulted from the loss from discontinued operations and the carry back of a portion of such loss to prior years 
in accordance with apb  since september   all losses of matrix telecom were deferred and were recognized as a reduction of the gain on the sale 
on november   we sold all of the stock of matrix telecom to matrix acquisition holdings corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of platinum equity holdings  llc  and recorded a gain of million 
the purchase price for the matrix telecom stock was valued at million and consisted of four components 
first  we received a credit against future charges incurred for long distance wholesale telephone traffic pursuant to our service contract with matrix telecom 
we calculated the amount of this credit to be million 
second  we eliminated million in intercompany indebtedness owed to matrix telecom by netlojix 
third  we retained federal income tax refunds paid to or due matrix telecom in the total amount of million 
fourth  we may receive a cash payment based upon matrix telecom s internet service customer base 
we currently do not expect any payment as a result of this component 
in addition  we received an indemnity from platinum against certain claims or liabilities arising under netlojix s secured credit facility with coast business credit 
netlojix also has been released by coast business credit from any claims or liabilities relating to borrowings secured by the assets of matrix telecom 
the amount of the final purchase price is subject to adjustment based on finalization of a balance sheet for matrix telecom as of august  and agreement by both parties 
we completed the balance sheet and we have been notified by platinum that they materially disagree with the closing balance sheet that we prepared 
we are currently attempting to negotiate a settlement of the balance sheet items in disagreement 
if the we are unable to resolve the matter  the balance sheet will be submitted to an independent firm of accountants chosen by the parties for final resolution 
any material adjustments  as determined by the independent accountants  will effect the purchase price and the recorded gain 
at this time  we believe that the ultimate resolution of the items in dispute will not materially effect the recorded gain 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues from continuing operations increased million or to million from million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is attributable to the share exchange between netlojix and matrix 
netlojix contributed approximately million of revenues for the period december  through december  subsequent to the share exchange compared with approximately million in network connectivity segment segment revenues  increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  within the network connectivity segment  data and voice services decreased million or and internet services increased million 
data and voice billable minutes decreased to million minutes or from million minutes in the decrease in compared with is attributable to the loss of a major customer in early and a decline in the billing rates per minute 
the loss of the major customer resulted in a decrease of million of revenues or approximately million billable minutes 
our average rate per minute during was cents compared to cents per minute in or an decline 
the decrease in per minute rates is attributable to continued competitive pricing pressures within the telecommunications industry 
internet connectivity revenues increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to the share exchange as internet connectivity revenues for are for the period december  through december  subsequent to the share exchange compared with twelve months in technical support segment technical support services revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to zero in in november  we acquired remote lojix which started our technical support services 
therefore the results represents two months of operating activity compared with none in application development and hosting segment application development and hosting segment revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to zero in the increase is primarily attributable to applications services that were acquired in the dmi acquisition in september and a  management fee relating to the acquisition of dmi that was recorded in gross margin gross margin from continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  gross margin increased by percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due to the addition of internet connectivity  technical support and applications development and hosting segments in late and which typically experience higher margins 
network connectivity segment the network connectivity segment recorded a gross margin of million during compared to a gross margin million for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was attributable to the addition of internet services on december  data and voice gross profit declined million to million in from million in gross margin as a percent of revenue averaged during compared with in due to increasing market demands  the company was forced to continue to decrease retail rates in  however  the underlying network costs did not change due to contractual commitments

stock compensation expense increased million in compared with during an additional expense was recognized in connection with the early vesting of a restricted stock grant to a departing director 
professional services increased million as a result of additional expenses associated with public company reporting requirements 
acquisition related write off the million write off relates to the share exchange as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from amortization of the acquired customer base associated with the share exchange of netlojix and matrix telecom effective december  the customer base is amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
similarly  the acquisition and consolidation of assets related to the share exchange resulted in some increases in depreciation expense 
as a result of the acquisitions of dmi and remote lojix in the fourth quarter of  netlojix recognized goodwill in the amount of million 
goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years 
remote lojix comprised million of the goodwill 
goodwill was determined by the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the assets received 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital current assets minus current liabilities of million 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  and as of march  we continue to have no outstanding debt 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million and we incurred significant losses from continuing operations in each of the previous two years 
our net loss totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used by continuing operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and in november we completed the sale of matrix telecom 
the purchase price for the matrix telecom stock was valued at  which is subject to adjustment based on finalization of a balance sheet for matrix telecom  inc as of august  and agreement by both parties 
we completed the balance sheet  and we have been notified by platinum that it materially disagrees with the closing balance sheet that we prepared 
we are currently attempting to negotiate a settlement of the balance sheet items in disagreement 
if we are unable to resolve the matter  the balance sheet will be submitted to an independent firm of accountants chosen by the parties for final resolution 
any material adjustments  as determined by the independent accountants  will effect the purchase price and the recorded gain 
at this time  we believe that the ultimate resolution of the items in dispute will not require any material expenditure on our part 
we used  of the long distance credit received in the sale of matrix telecom during the period commencing on september  and ending on november  after november   the amount of the long distance credit used may not exceed  per month 
we have used an additional  in february  we intend to use this long distance credit  to the extent available  to offset our costs for long distance service which we continue to provide to our business customers 
however  we are not obligated to continue to purchase long distance services from matrix telecom 
in march   we restructured our secured credit facility with coast business credit 
under the restructured line of credit  we may borrow up to of eligible receivables as defined up to a total amount of million 
the percentage may be increased to of eligible receivables if we reach certain operational targets 
in addition  the line of credit may be used to provide a facility for issuing letters of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest  payable monthly  based upon the prime rate of bank of america nt sa plus at march  
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
currently no amount is outstanding under the credit facility 
on april   we entered into the equity line agreement with cambois finance 
under the terms of the equity line agreement  we may sell or put our common stock to cambois finance  at our option at any time  subject to the satisfaction of several conditions 
the equity line agreement provides for cambois finance to purchase up to  of our common stock  subject to our filing and maintaining an effective registration statement  trading price and volume minimums  and limits on the amount and frequency on sales of common stock under the line 
as of march   we had sold a total of  shares of common stock to cambois finance for total proceeds of  on april   we sold  shares of newly designated series b convertible preferred stock to three private investors for  the series b convertible preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option of the series b investors at any time 
as of december   all shares of the series b convertible preferred stock had been converted into a total of  shares of netlojix common stock 
as a result  no shares of the series b convertible preferred stock are outstanding 
on march  we raised million through a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share 
historically  our cash flow from operations  our secured borrowings  our private placements of both common and preferred stock and our equity line agreement with cambois finance  inc have been sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  our equity line agreement and our secured line of credit with coast business credit are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements from our current operations into the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to raise capital by putting common stock to cambois finance under the equity line agreement is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions  as discussed above 
additionally  an important component of our past growth has been to develop our business through acquisitions 
we intend to continue this strategy 
in appropriate circumstances  we may use our capital stock for acquisitions in addition to debt and equity financing 
inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability
