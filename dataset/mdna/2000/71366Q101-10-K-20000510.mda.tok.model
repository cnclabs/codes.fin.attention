overview peregrine systems  inc is a leading provider of infrastructure management and e infrastructure software products and solutions 
our products help businesses to deploy  maintain  and dispose of numerous aspects of their corporate infrastructure 
using common shared data  our products help to manage information technology assets as well as assets relating to corporate facilities and vehicle fleets 
in addition  we have recently introduced products for rail management and internet based asset procurement 
until late  our product offerings focused principally on managing information technology assets through a consolidated enterprise service desk that provided support to users of our customers information technology systems and networks 
during fiscal  we determined that our customers required a more comprehensive solution to control and manage their infrastructure assets  including information technology assets as well as the numerous other assets that make up business infrastructures 
among other things  we determined that businesses needed to be able to manage the availability of their assets  minimize their investments and expense  consolidate data about infrastructure assets  and interface their asset management solutions to enterprise applications 
accordingly  we refocused our product development and marketing strategies to focus on an infrastructure resource management strategy 
in order to execute on our infrastructure resource management strategy  we have completed a number of acquisitions since late these acquisitions have been designed to broaden our infrastructure resource management product suite 
in september  we acquired apsylog sa  a provider of asset management software focused principally on managing information technology assets 
in july  we acquired innovative tech systems  a provider of software products that address management of corporate facilities 
in september  we acquired technologies and other assets from related entities operating as international software solutions 
these technologies expanded the ability of our products to help manage information technology assets by permitting network help desk analysts to interface with users over the corporate network 
in march  we acquired prototype  a provider of software products for managing corporate vehicle fleets 
in april  we acquired fprint  a british provider of software used to discover and inventory software located on the computers of individual users on a corporate network 
in september  we acquired knowlix  a developer of knowledge management software that assists network help desk analysts by managing the intangible technical information and know how required to assist callers 
in march  we acquired telco research  a provider of software products that help manage telecommunications assets  and barnhill management group  a services and solutions delivery partner of peregrine with extensive experience in the telecommunications industry 
our software products are currently available on most major computer operating platforms  however  for the past several years  over of our license sales have been attributable to the unix and windows nt platforms 
our revenues are derived from product licensing and services 
services are comprised of maintenance  professional services  and training 
license fees are generally due upon the granting of the license and typically include a one year maintenance and warranty period as part of the license agreement 
we also provide ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee based upon the current price of the product 
revenues from license agreements are recognized currently  provided that all of the following conditions are met a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable and the risk of concession is deemed remote  and no other significant vendor obligations exist 
revenues from post contract support services are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  generally one year 
maintenance revenues which are bundled with license agreements are unbundled using vendor specific objective evidence 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services most often performed on a time and material basis under separate service agreements for the installation of our products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the respective services are performed 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our license revenues from the sale of our infrastructure resource management applications and our e infrastructure solutions 
we expect these products to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our infrastructure resource management strategy and applications  including future product enhancements 
substantially all of our license revenues are derived from granting a non exclusive perpetual license to use our products 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of the infrastructure resource management applications  such as competition or technological change  manner of distribution or licensing  and related method of revenue recognition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
march  statement of operations data revenues licenses services total revenues costs and expenses cost of licenses cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income and other income loss from before income taxes income tax expense net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march    and revenues revenues 
total revenues were million  million and million for fiscal year end  and  representing period to period increases of and for the fiscal and periods 
the reasons for the revenue increases are more fully discussed below 
licenses 
license revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing of total revenues in fiscal and in both fiscal and total license revenues increased and period to period for fiscal and domestic license revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal  while international license revenues increased and in fiscal and the increases in license revenues are attributable to increased demand for new and additional licenses of our infrastructure resource management applications  from new and existing customers  larger transaction sizes  expansion of our domestic and international sales forces  and acquisitions 
we expect larger transaction sizes from a limited number of customers to account for a large percentage of license revenues for the foreseeable future 
management believes these trends will fluctuate period to period in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
during the past three years  we have increased the number of channels that we use to distribute our products 
the majority of our products are distributed through our direct sales organization 
the balance is derived through indirect sales channels and alliance partners  including value added resellers and systems integrators 
revenues derived through indirect channel sales now comprise a significant portion of our total license revenues 
we have substantially less ability to manage our sales through indirect channels and less visibility about our partners success in selling the products that they have purchased from us 
to the extent indirect sales continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue  we could experience unforseen variability in our future revenues and operating results if our partners are unable to sell our products 
services 
services revenues consist of support  consulting and training services 
service revenues were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  representing of total revenues in fiscal and in both fiscal and total services revenues increased and period to period for fiscal and domestic services increased in fiscal and in fiscal  while international services revenues increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
the dollar increases are attributable to maintenance agreements and related billings from our expanded installed base of customers and an increase in consulting and training revenues related to the implementation of our software from initial license agreements and related expansion 
while these revenues are increasing in absolute dollars  we expect these trends to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
costs and expenses cost of licenses 
cost of licenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  each representing less than of total revenues in these periods 
cost of software licenses includes third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation and production 
these costs are expected to remain the same or increase as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of services 
cost of services were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
cost of services primarily consists of personnel  facilities and system costs in providing support  consulting and training services 
the dollar increases are attributable to an increase in personnel related costs in order to support the related activities 
cost of services increased as a percentage of related revenues due largely to a greater percentage growth in lower margin consulting revenue compared to support revenue 
consulting and training services generally have lower margins as compared to support services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in both fiscal and sales and marketing expenses consists primarily of personnel related costs  including commissions and bonuses  facilities and system costs and travel and entertainment 
the dollar increases in sales and marketing expenses are attributable to the significant expansion of both the north american and international sales forces  a large increase in general and product specific marketing expenses  much of which related to our e commerce initiatives  the effect of combining the sales and marketing operations of the acquisitions made during fiscal and  and the effect of certain operating expense increases 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts and establish additional sales offices around the world 
if we experience a decrease in sales force productivity or for any other reason a decline in revenues  it is likely that our operating margins will decline as well 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing  and of total revenues in those periods 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  developer bonuses  quality assurance activities and consulting costs 
the dollar increases in research and development are due primarily to an increase in the number of personnel conducting research and development  new product initiatives and quality assurance efforts 
these costs are expected to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively the same as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing of total revenues in fiscal and and of total revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee salaries and overhead for administrative personnel 
the dollar increases from year to year are attributable to costs associated with administrative personnel additions and infrastructure expansion to support our growth 
these costs are expected to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively the same as a percentage of total revenues 
amortization of intangibles and other assets 
amortization of intangibles and other assets were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing  and of total revenues in those periods 
the dollar and percentage increases are attributable to the amortization of intangible assets and goodwill related to acquisitions made during those respective periods 
these costs in future periods will be subject to future potential acquisitions and amortization periods 
these costs are typically amortized over a five year period 
see note of notes to peregrine consolidated financial statements 
acquired research and development costs 
acquired in process research and development costs were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  representing  and of total revenues in those periods 
the costs incurred in fiscal relate to one time charges associated with the acquisitions of fprint  knowlix  and telco research 
the costs incurred in fiscal and relate to one time charges associated with the acquisitions of innovative and apsylog and the acquisition of certain technology and other assets from a group of affiliated entities conducting business as international software solutions 
these costs in future periods will be subject to future potential acquisitions 
see note of notes to peregrine consolidated financial statements 
the value of each acquisition s acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
with respect to the acquired in process technology  the calculations of value were adjusted to reflect the value creation efforts of the companies acquired prior to the close of each acquisition 
the nature of the efforts required to develop acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
if the research and development project and technologies are not completed as planned  they will neither satisfy the technical requirements of a changing market nor be cost effective 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
we currently believe that actual results have been consistent with forecasts with respect to acquired in process revenues 
because we do not account for expenses by product  it is not possible to determine the actual expenses associated with any of the acquired technologies 
however  we believe that expenses incurred to date associated with the development and integration of the acquired in process research and development projects are substantially consistent with our previous estimates 
we have completed many of the original research and development projects in accordance with our plans 
we continue to work toward the completion of other projects 
the majority of the projects are on schedule  but delays may occur due to changes in technological and market requirements for our products 
the risks associated with these efforts are still considered high and no assurance can be made that any upcoming products will meet with market acceptance 
delays in the introduction of certain products may adversely affect our revenues and earnings in future quarters 
provision for income taxes income tax expenses were million  million and million for fiscal year  and this increase in absolute dollars is attributable to an increase in operating profits 
excluding the effect on net income of the acquired in process research and development costs and amortization of intangibles  our effective tax rates were  and for those fiscal years 
these costs are expected to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively the same as a percentage of operating profits 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and marketable equity securities increased to million in fiscal year end from million in fiscal this increase is attributable to cash provided through ongoing operations  sale or assignment of accounts receivables and cash received as a result of the exercise of stock options under our stock incentive plans 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was as of march  as compared with as of march  since march   we have expended significant funds to strengthen our operating infrastructure  including payments related to our lease commitments for our recently signed campus leases 
these leases require a minimum aggregate lease payment of approximately million over their twelve year term 
in addition  we have expended significant funds acquiring companies and technologies subsequent to fiscal year end during july  we entered into a million senior credit facility for a term of three years with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
we believe that our current cash  short term investments  cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent we experience growth in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or which may be dilutive 
as of march   there were no amounts outstanding with respect to the million senior credit facility 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk other than forward rate currency contracts described below  which are used for hedging our foreign currency risk  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts and contracts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
we conduct business overseas in a number of foreign currencies  principally in europe 
these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
although we currently derive no material revenues from highly inflationary economies  we are expanding our presence in international markets outside europe  including the pacific rim and latin america  whose currencies have tended to fluctuate more relative to the us dollar 
there can be no assurance that european currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  revenues and financial condition 
currently  we attempt to mitigate our transaction currency risks through our foreign currency hedging program 
the hedging program consists primarily of using forward rate currency contracts of approximately one month in length to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
currency contracts are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and receive hedge accounting treatment 
to the extent not properly hedged by obligations denominated in local currencies  our foreign operations remain subject to the risks of future foreign currency fluctuations  and there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against such risk 
factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including the following risks relating to peregrine we have a history of losses  cannot predict our future operating results  and cannot assure our future profitability 
in addition  management does not believe recent revenue growth rates are necessarily sustainable 
prediction of our future operating results is difficult  if not impossible  and we have incurred substantial losses in recent years 
if we continue to incur losses  if our revenues decline or grow at a slower rate  or if our expenses increase without commensurate increases in revenues  our operating results will suffer and our stock price may fall 
through march   we had recorded cumulative net losses of approximately million  including approximately million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with several acquisitions completed since late we have also incurred  and expect to continue to incur  substantial expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets 
in addition  our management does not believe our recent growth rates are necessarily sustainable in the future or indicative of future growth rates 
if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are fixed and cannot be easily or quickly changed 
our revenues vary significantly from quarter to quarter for numerous reasons beyond our control 
quarter to quarter variations could result in substantial decreases in our stock price if our revenues or operating results are less than market analysts anticipate 
our revenues or operating results in a given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated by market analysts  which could result in substantial declines in our stock price 
in addition  quarter to quarter variations could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could also result in stock price declines 
our revenues and operating results will vary from quarter to quarter for many reasons beyond our control 
as a result  our quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
reasons for variability of our revenues and operating results include the following size  timing  and contractual terms of orders 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license agreements  if the completion of a large license agreement is delayed  or if the contract terms prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
in addition  when negotiating large software licenses  many customers tend to time their negotiations until quarter end in an effort to improve their ability to negotiate more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we tend to recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter  and license revenues in a given quarter will substantially depend on orders booked during the last month or weeks of a quarter 
our revenue growth in recent periods has been attributable in part to an increase in the number of large license transactions we completed in a given period 
we expect our reliance on these large transactions to continue for the forseeable future 
if we are unable to complete a large license transaction in a particular quarter  our revenues and operating results could be materially below the expectations of market analysts  and our stock price could fall 
announcements by peregrine or our competitors 
announcements of new products or releases by us or our competitors could cause customers to delay purchases pending the introduction of the new product or release 
in addition  announcements by us or our competitors concerning pricing policies could have an effect on our revenues in a given quarter 
customer budgeting cycles 
our quarter to quarter revenues will depend on customer budgeting cycles 
if customers change their budgeting cycles  or reduce their capital spending on technology  our revenues could decline 
changes in product mix 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results because some products provide higher margins than others 
for example  margins on software licenses tend to be higher than margins on maintenance services 
changes in method of sale 
our profit margins will tend to vary based on whether a sale was made through our direct sales force or through a reseller or other strategic partner 
sales through indirect channels tend to be less profitable  and if sales through indirect channels increased relative to direct sales  our operating results could be harmed 
sales through indirect channels  including distributors  third party resellers  and system integrators  represent a significant percentage of our total sales 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
as a result  we could experience a shortfall in our revenues  or a substantial decline in our rate of revenue growth  if sales through our indirect channels were to decrease or were to increase at a slower rate 
we have less ability to manage our sales through indirect channels and less visibility about our channel partners success in selling our products 
as a result  we could experience unforeseen variability in our revenues and operating results for a number of reasons  including the following inability of our channel partners to sell our products  a decision by our channel partners to favor products that compete with peregrine s  inability of our channel partners to manage the timing of their purchases from peregrine against their sales to end users  resulting in substantial inventories of unsold licenses held by our channel partners  or our inability to increase the number of channel partners that sell our products and to maintain relationships with existing channel partners 
cancellation of licenses or maintenance agreements 
cancellations of licenses or maintenance contracts could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results 
in particular  our customers tend to renew their maintenance contracts on an annual basis 
substantial cancellations of maintenance agreements  or a substantial failure to renew maintenance contracts  would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
delays in customer orders could result in our revenues being substantially below the expectations of market analysts 
in addition  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses during a particular period in an effort to obtain orders 
if we are unsuccessful in generating offsetting revenues during that period  our revenues and earnings could be substantially reduced or we could experience a large loss 
we are likely to experience delays in customer orders because the sales cycle for our products is long and unpredictable 
specifically  our customers planning and purchase decisions involve a significant commitment of resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
the sales cycle for our products requires us to engage in a sales cycle that  if it results in a sale  takes six to nine months to complete 
the length of the sales cycle may be extended beyond six or nine months due to factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition we encounter in our sales activities 
during the sales cycle  we typically provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may result in a periodic reduction in our revenues and impairment of our operating results 
seasonality in our business could result in our revenues in a given period being less than market estimates 
seasonality could also result in quarter to quarter decreases in our revenues 
in either of these events  seasonality could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
historically  our revenues and operating results in our december quarter have tended to benefit  relative to our june and september quarters  from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements 
revenues and operating results in our march quarter have tended to benefit from the efforts of our sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
these historical patterns may change over time  however  particularly as our operations become larger and the sources of our revenue change or become more diverse 
for example  our international operations have expanded significantly in recent years  particularly in europe 
we also have an international presence in the pacific rim and latin america 
we may experience variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in these foreign markets 
as an example  the september quarter is typically weaker in europe for many technology companies  including peregrine  due to the european summer holiday season 
if a market for our infrastructure resource management software and asset procurement solutions does not develop  we will be unable to sell our products or increase our revenues 
the market for our products is still relatively new and unproven 
if the market for our infrastructure management software products does not continue to develop as we anticipate  our business and operating results would be adversely affected  and our financial condition could deteriorate 
until recently  our product strategy focused on providing software products that help to manage business computer networks and other information technology assets 
beginning in late  we began to broaden our product line to offer products capable of managing multiple aspects of a business enterprise s infrastructure  including its physical plant and facilities  its telecommunications networks  its distribution systems  and its corporate car and rail fleets 
prior to our introduction of these products  an integrated software solution for managing corporate infrastructure assets did not exist in the market 
rather  corporations purchased software to manage specific components of their infrastructure 
in the second half of fiscal  we attempted to further expand our infrastructure management product line by introducing get 
it  a line of employee self service products that facilitate the acquisition and use of infrastructure assets  services  and information 
as a result  the market for our products is still new and unproven and is continuing to develop 
if a market for infrastructure management solutions fails to develop  or develops in ways we do not anticipate  our business would be seriously impaired 
in particular  our revenues and operating results would decrease  and we could experience losses 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards  or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products may decrease 
as a result of rapid technological change in our industry  our competitive position in existing markets  or in markets we may enter in the future  can be eroded rapidly by product advances and technological changes 
we may be unable to improve the performance and features of our products as necessary to respond to these developments 
in addition  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance depend in part on our ability to improve existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer needs  and respond to competitive products 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments 
in addition  if we are required to expend substantial resources to respond to specific technological or product changes  our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we cannot attract experienced sales personnel  software developers  and highly trained customer service personnel  we will not be able to sell and support our products 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel  software developers  and customer service personnel  our revenue growth rates could decrease  or our revenues could decline  and our operating results could be materially harmed 
our products and services require a sophisticated selling effort targeted at several key people within our prospective customers organizations 
this process requires the efforts of experienced sales personnel as well as specialized consulting professionals 
in addition  the complexity of our products  and issues associated with installing and maintaining them  require highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we intend to hire a significant number of these personnel in the future and train them in the use of our products 
we believe our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain these key employees 
competition for these employees is intense  and we have in the past experienced difficulty recruiting qualified employees 
our business would be harmed if one or more members of our senior management team chose to leave us 
the loss of the services of one or more our executive officers or key employees  or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor  could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and other key sales  consulting  technical  and marketing personnel 
none of our senior management is bound by an employment agreement 
in addition  only a few employees who were significant shareholders of businesses we acquired are bound by noncompetition agreements 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
if we fail to manage expansion effectively  this will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
our recent growth rates have placed a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years and intend to continue to expand in order to pursue market opportunities that our management believes are attractive 
our customer relationships could be strained if we are unable to devote sufficient resources to them as a result of our growth  which could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results 
new product introductions or enhancements of existing products by our competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
if we cannot compete effectively in our market by offering products that are comparable in functionality  ease of use  and price to those of our competitors  our revenues will decrease  and our operating results would be adversely affected 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse  and the technologies for infrastructure management software products can change rapidly 
new products are introduced frequently and existing products are continually enhanced 
we face competition from a number of sources in the markets for our infrastructure resource management and e procurement software solutions 
in the markets for our infrastructure resource management solutions  we face competition from providers of internal help desk software applications for managing information technology service desks  such as remedy corporation and tivoli systems  that compete with our enterprise service desk software  providers of asset management software  including remedy  maincontrol  and janus technologies  providers of facilities management software  including archibus  facilities information systems  and assetworks a division of csi maximus  providers of transportation management software that competes with our fleet management and rail management software  including control software a division of csi maximus and project software and development inc  information technology and systems management companies such as ibm  computer associates  network associates  hewlett packard  and microsoft  numerous start up and other entrepreneurial companies offering products that compete with the functionality offered by one or more of our infrastructure management products  and the internal information technology departments of those companies with infrastructure management needs 
in the markets for procurement and e procurement solutions  we have experienced competition from established competitors in the business to business internet commerce solution market  such as ariba and commerceone  and established providers of enterprise resource planning software that are entering the market for procurement and e procurement solutions  including oracle and sap 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we have 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  which could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results 
new competitors and alliances among existing competitors could impair our ability to retain and expand our market share 
additional competition from new entrepreneurial companies or established companies entering our markets could have an adverse effect on our business  revenues  and operating results 
in addition  alliances among companies that are not currently direct competitors could create new competitors with substantial market presence 
because few barriers to entry exist in the software industry  we anticipate additional competition from new and established companies as well as business alliances 
we expect that the software industry will continue to consolidate 
in particular  we expect that large software companies will continue to acquire or establish alliances with our smaller competitors  thereby increasing the resources available to these competitors 
these new competitors or alliances could rapidly acquire significant market share at our expense 
system management companies may acquire infrastructure management and or help desk software companies and close their systems to our products  harming our ability to sell our products 
if large system management providers close their systems to our products  our revenues and operating results would be seriously harmed 
our ability to sell our products depends in large part on our products compatibility with and support by providers of system management products  including tivoli  computer associates  and hewlett packard 
both tivoli and hewlett packard have acquired providers of help desk software products 
these large  established providers of system management products and services may decide to close their systems to competing vendors like us 
they may also decide to bundle the products that compete with our products with other products for enterprise licenses for promotional purposes or as part of a long term pricing strategy 
if that were to happen  our ability to sell our products could be adversely affected 
increased competition may result from acquisitions of help desk and other infrastructure management software vendors by system management companies 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reductions in our gross margins  or reductions in our market share 
any of these events would adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may be unable to expand our business and increase our revenues if we are unable to expand our distribution channels 
if we are unable to expand our distribution channels effectively  our business  revenues  and operating results could be harmed 
in particular  we will need to expand our direct sales force and establish relationships with additional system integrators  original manufacturers  and other third party channel partners who market and sell our products 
if we cannot establish these relationships  or if our channel partners are unable to market our products effectively or provide cost effective customer support and service  our revenues and operating results will be harmed 
even where we are successful in establishing a new third party relationship  our agreement with the third party may not be exclusive 
as a result  our partner may carry competing product lines 
if we are unable to expand our business internationally  our business  revenues  and operating results could be harmed 
in order to grow our business  increase our revenues  and improve our operating results  we believe we must expand internationally 
if we expend substantial resources pursuing an international strategy and are not successful  our revenues would be less than we or market analysts anticipate  and our operating results would suffer 
international revenues represented approximately of peregrine s business in each of fiscal and and approximately of peregrine s business in fiscal we have several international sales offices in europe as well as offices in japan  singapore  and australia 
international expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources  and we may not be successful expanding our international operations 
we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
conducting business internationally poses risks that could affect our financial results 
even if we are successful in expanding our operations internationally  conducting business outside north america poses many risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
these include the following gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us  longer payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls  or other restrictions that impair trade 
if immigration laws limit our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries  our business and operating results could be harmed 
limitations under united states immigration laws could prevent us from recruiting skilled technical personnel from foreign countries  which could harm our business if we do not have sufficient personnel to develop new products and respond to technological changes 
this inability to hire technical personnel could lead to future decreases in our revenues  or decreases in our revenue growth rates  either of which would adversely affect our operating results 
because of severe shortages for qualified technical personnel in the united states  many companies  including peregrine  have recruited engineers and other technical personnel from foreign countries 
foreign computer professionals such as those we have employed typically become eligible for employment in the united states by obtaining a nonimmigrant visa 
the number of nonimmigrant visas is limited annually by federal immigration laws 
in recent years  despite increases in the number of available visas  the annual allocation has been exhausted well before year end 
we have made substantial capital commitments that could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition if our business does not grow 
we have made substantial capital commitments as a result of recent growth in our business that could seriously harm our financial condition if our business does not grow and we do not have adequate resources to satisfy our obligations 
in june  we entered into a series of leases providing us with approximately  square feet of office space and an option to lease  square feet 
even excluding the exercise of the option  the leases require a minimum aggregate lease payment of approximately million over the twelve year term of the leases 
the office space including the option is intended for a five building campus in san diego  california 
we plan to fully occupy three of these buildings by the summer of and for the present time to sublease the remaining two buildings 
the capital commitments  construction oversight  and movement of personnel and facilities involved in a transaction of this type and magnitude present numerous risks  including failure to properly estimate the future growth of our business  inability to sublease excess office space if we underestimate future growth  disruption of operations  and inability to match fixed lease payments with fluctuating revenues  which could impair our earnings or result in losses 
product development delays could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenues 
if we experience significant product development delays  our position in the market would be harmed  and our revenues could be substantially reduced  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
in particular  we may experience product development delays associated with the integration of recently acquired products and technologies 
delays may occur for many reasons  including an inability to hire sufficient number of developers  discovery of bugs and errors  or a failure of our current or future products to conform to industry requirements 
errors or other software bugs in our products could result in significant expenditures to remedy or correct the errors or bugs 
if we are required to expend significant amounts to correct software bugs or errors  our revenues could be harmed as a result of our inability to deliver the product  and our operating results could be impaired as we incur additional costs without offsetting revenues 
errors can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
we have experienced errors in the past that resulted in delays in product shipment and increased costs 
discovery of errors could result in any of the following loss of or delay in revenues and loss of customers or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources and increased development expenses  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
we could experience losses as a result of our strategic investments 
if our strategic investments in other companies are not successful  we could incur losses 
we have made and expect to continue to make minority investments in companies with businesses or technologies that we consider to be complementary with our business or technologies 
these investments have generally been made by issuing shares of our common stock or to a lesser extent with cash 
many of these investments are in companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as profitable concerns 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in our incurring losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of its investments 
we could be competitively disadvantaged if we were unable to protect our intellectual property 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our competitors could offer similar products relying on technologies developed by us  potentially harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the distribution of our software  documentation  and other proprietary information and by relying on a combination of copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws 
in addition  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain customers  vendors  and strategic partners 
in some circumstances  however  we may  if required by a business relationship  provide our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  and some foreign laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of other 
if we are required to pursue litigation to enforce our proprietary rights  we could incur substantial costs  and management attention could be diverted  either of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
if we become involved in a protracted intellectual property dispute  or one with a significant damages award  or which requires us to cease selling our products  we could be subject to significant liability and the time and attention of our management could be diverted 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including companies in the software industry 
intellectual property claims against us and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating  or using products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed technology  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed technology on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  our revenues could decline or our expenses could increase 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs 
if we are held liable for damages incurred as a result of our products  our operating results could be significantly impaired 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
these limitations may not be effect under the laws of some jurisdictions  however 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risks of these claims 
control by our officers and directors may limit our stockholders ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could delay or prevent a change in control  which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium in the market price of their common stock 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock by our officers and directors could delay or prevent a change in control or discourage a potential acquiror from attempting to obtain control of us 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent the stockholders from realizing a premium in the market price of our common stock in the event of an acquisition 
as of march   our officers and directors owned approximately  shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exercise of options exercisable within days of march   representing approximately of our total shares outstanding 
assuming the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with our contemplated merger with harbinger corporation  our officers and directors will own approximately of our outstanding common stock not including shares held by those officers and directors of harbinger who will become officers and directors of peregrine after the merger 
for information about the ownership of common stock by our executive officers and stockholders  see peregrine principal stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential acquisition bids for us and may prevent changes in our management that our stockholders otherwise would approve 
some provisions of our charter documents eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and impose specific procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at a stockholder meeting 
these provisions are intended to increase the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and the policies established by the board of directors 
these provisions also discourage some types of transactions  which may involve an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
as a result  these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction 
these provisions are also intended to discourage common tactics that may be used in proxy fights 
as a result  they could have the effect of discouraging third parties from making tender offers for our shares 
these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preference  privileges  and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock allows us to have flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
the issuance of preferred stock  however  may delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and other rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected  including the loss of voting control to others 
additional risks relating to the proposed acquisition of harbinger on april   we announced that we had signed a definitive merger agreement with harbinger corporation  a provider of business to business electronic commerce products and services 
if the merger is completed  we will issue of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of harbinger common stock and will assume all outstanding options and warrants to acquire harbinger common stock the number and exercise price of which will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio 
we expect to issue approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding equity securities of harbinger 
we expect the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and will be treated as a tax free reorganization 
the definitive agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both harbinger and peregrine 
closing of the merger is subject to approval by peregrine s and harbinger s stockholders  regulatory approvals  and customary closing conditions 
in connection with the proposed merger  we expect to file a proxy statement and registration statement on form s with the sec  and harbinger expects to file a proxy statement with the sec 
we expect that harbinger and peregrine will mail a joint proxy statement prospectus to stockholders of harbinger and peregrine containing additional information about the proposed merger 
investors and security holders are urged to read the registration statement and the joint proxy statement prospectus carefully when they are available 
the registration statement and the joint proxy statement prospectus will contain important information about harbinger  peregrine  the proposed merger  risks related to the merger  the persons soliciting proxies relating to the proposed merger  their interests in the proposed merger  and related matters 
we may experience problems integrating the businesses of peregrine and harbinger 
any integration problems could cause us to incur substantial unanticipated costs and expenses  which would harm our operating results 
if we fail to integrate our businesses successfully  we will incur substantial costs  which will increase our expenses and reduce any earnings or potentially result in losses  and we will fail to achieve the expected synergies and cost reductions of the merger 
in addition  integration problems could divert management s attention from other business opportunities  which could result in slower revenue growth than anticipated or in declines in revenue 
integrating our business with harbinger s business will be complex  time consuming  and expensive 
it may disrupt both companies businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
peregrine and harbinger are both global companies with substantial operations throughout the world  and integrating geographically separate and dispersed organizations may be difficult 
we have never attempted to integrate an acquisition of a company as large as harbinger 
specific integration challenges faced by peregrine and harbinger include the following retaining existing customers and strategic partners  retaining and integrating management and other key employees of both companies  combining product offerings and product lines effectively and quickly  including technical integration by our respective engineering teams  integrating sales efforts so that customers can easily do business with the combined company  transitioning multiple locations around the world to common systems  including common information technology systems  persuading employees that the business cultures of the two companies are compatible  successfully developing and promoting a unified brand strategy and marketing it to existing and prospective customers  and developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies 
the merger could impair existing relationships with suppliers  customers  strategic partners  and employees  which could have an adverse effect on our individual and combined businesses and financial results 
the public announcement of the merger could substantially impair important business relationships of either company 
impairment of these business relationships could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses  either of which would harm our financial results 
specific examples of situations in which we could experience problems include the following suppliers  distributors  or customers of either peregrine or harbinger could decide to cancel or terminate existing arrangements  or fail to renew those arrangements  as a result of the merger  potential customers who are currently negotiating with peregrine or harbinger with respect to the purchase or license of their products and services may delay purchases  or defer or terminate negotiations  as a result of uncertainty about the merger  customers of harbinger who use our competitors products could terminate or delay orders with harbinger because they question harbinger s continued commitment to provide products and enhancements  or to support products  used in conjunction with products of our competitors  key employees of harbinger  particularly those for whom vesting of options or other benefits will accelerate as a result of the merger  may decide to terminate their employment  and other current or prospective employees of peregrine and harbinger may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company  which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
the merger could result in slower revenue growth rates for the combined company than those applicable to us prior to the merger  which could adversely affect the operating results of the combined company and lead to a decline in its stock price 
harbinger s revenues and profits could decrease as it transitions to a business model that emphasizes recurring services revenues 
we may not be able to maintain our recent revenue growth rates after the merger  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenues grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal harbinger has experienced substantially slower growth rates than we have in recent periods  with revenues growing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal harbinger is currently changing its business model by creating and supporting internet based trading solutions that assist companies to automate their procurement process and by providing customers with the ability to use harbinger s products on a hosted subscription basis 
if the merger does not create the product and financial synergies management currently anticipates  and particularly if harbinger s business transition is not successful  the combined company s revenue growth rates could be substantially lower than our recent growth rates 
in particular  if we and harbinger experience integration problems  our management s attention could be diverted from our existing core business and lead to slower revenue growth rates for that business 
even if the merger is not completed  our management does not believe that our historical growth rates can necessarily be maintained 
a more detailed discussion of our business and associated risks is contained under the caption risks related to peregrine 
harbinger and some of its current and former officers and directors are defendants in shareholder litigation for which harbinger is not insured 
the outcome of this litigation  if determined adversely to harbinger  could have an adverse effect on the combined company s financial condition after the merger 
if outstanding shareholder litigation against harbinger were decided adversely to harbinger  or harbinger were required to settle this litigation for a substantial sum  our financial condition as a combined company after the merger could be materially and adversely affected 
in september  a complaint was filed against harbinger and some of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
the complaint alleges causes of action for misrepresentation and violations of federal securities laws 
an amended complaint was filed in march  alleging additional causes of action  including allegations relating to accounting improprieties 
the complaints relate to actions by harbinger during the period from february to october harbinger did not maintain directors and officers liability insurance during this period 
as a result  harbinger is not insured with respect to any potential liability of harbinger or any officer or director of harbinger 
harbinger is  however  obligated under agreements with each of its officers and directors to indemnify them for the costs incurred in connection with defending themselves against this litigation and is obligated to indemnify them to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law if they are held liable 
the pending litigation is still in the early stages 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the damages  or range of damages  that harbinger or the combined company might incur in connection with this litigation 
in addition  defending the litigation will involve substantial direct expenses and will likely result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations  which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations of harbinger or the combined company 
our reported financial results will suffer as a result of purchase accounting treatment of the merger and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchase accounting treatment of the merger will result in a net loss for us for the foreseeable future  which could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
under purchase accounting  we will record the following as an asset on its balance sheet the fair value of the consideration given for harbinger s outstanding common stock  the fair value of the consideration given for outstanding options and warrants to purchase harbinger common stock  which we will assume in connection with the merger  and merger related direct transaction costs  including the fees of our legal  accounting  and financial advisors 
we will allocate these costs to individual harbinger assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these assets and liabilities will include various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology  acquired trademarks and tradenames  and acquired workforce 
intangible assets  including goodwill  will be amortized over a five year period 
in addition  we will allocate a portion of the purchase price for acquiring harbinger to in process research and development 
in process research and development  which is currently estimated at million for harbinger  will be expensed in the quarter in which the merger is completed 
the amount of purchase cost allocated to goodwill and other intangibles is estimated to be approximately billion 
if goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized in equal annual amounts following completion of the merger  the accounting charge attributable to these items would be approximately million per fiscal year 
our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger 
if the combined company is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger  our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interest without receiving any commensurate benefit 
in connection with the merger  we anticipate that we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock including options being assumed  representing approximately of our outstanding common stock prior to the merger 
failure to complete the merger could have a negative impact on our stock price as well as a negative impact on our businesses and financial results 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  we may be subject to a number of material risks  including the following the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the relevant current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed 
our stock price may also decline because of uncertainty concerning our stand alone prospects  and some costs related to the merger  such as legal  accounting  financial advisory  and financial printing fees must be paid even if the merger is not completed
