item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this research led to the development of a proprietary second generation implanter  the ibis which we began selling in  and to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  there has been a shift in revenue to sales of simox soi wafers for commercial applications and sales of ibis implanters 
in  substantially all of our wafer sales were for commercial applications 
to date  most of our customers that have purchased wafers for commercial applications have done so solely for the purpose of characterizing and evaluating the wafers or for pilot production 
thus  historical sales are not necessarily indicative of future operations because such sales would not be considered of a recurring nature 
however  three of our customers have indicated their intentions to adopt simox soi technology in commercial products 
during  and  ibis experienced quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of receipt of equipment orders  use of the implanters for simox soi development  and dependence on a limited number of customers 
we may continue to experience fluctuations in revenue due to equipment sales  shifts in customer demands during various stages of the simox soi sales cycle and until we have a sufficient number of ibis s on line to support the various product lines  wafer sizes and continued research and development efforts 
ibis currently has three ibis oxygen implanters producing wafers  one of which was funded by motorola corporation and must first be used to serve motorola s production requirements

impact of the year issue the year issue the year issue refers to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips or software that use dates where the date has been stored as just two digits eg  for 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism incorporating date sensitive software which was using only two digits to represent the year could have recognized a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
costs associated with the year issue the costs incurred by ibis to conduct the review of our internal information systems and to identify the impact of the year issue on our major suppliers and customers were immaterial 
the costs to implement our common software system were not considered year costs as they were included in our software integration plan and were not accelerated due to year issues 
the costs to perform upgrades to correct the year issues that we identified were approximately  the year issue did not have a material effect on ibis internal information systems 
we cannot be sure  however  that we will not in the future identify non compliant systems or other problems related to the year issue which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results or financial condition 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on ibis 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of  reflecting in large part our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the august public sale of  shares of common stock

this accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
due to the capital intensive nature of ibis business and the anticipated expansion of its facilities and production capacity  management expects that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a significant portion of its expenses 
to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt and equity financings 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december  were to fund ibis operations and additions to property and equipment which totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had invested  in property and equipment 
at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately  in material or subassemblies to be used for manufacturing ibis implanters and approximately  in capital equipment purchases 
on august   ibis completed the public offering of  shares of common stock in an offering underwritten by soundview technology group 
the shares were included in a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  and declared effective on july  net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and ibis intends to use the proceeds to fund research and development  capital expenditures  working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that we may be required to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to finance further expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our research and development programs 
our existing cash resources together with funds generated from operations are believed to be sufficient to support ibis operations on our anticipated scale for at least the next eighteen months 
management of ibis currently believes that this anticipated scale of operations will include the addition of ibis oxygen implanters in addition to our oxygen implanters currently on line  the purchase of support equipment  the expansion of ibis facilities and the design and development of the next generation oxygen implanter  the ibis additional implanters are expected to be transferred to production at various times as additional capacity is needed to meet demand 
effects of inflation ibis believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas that establishes accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposures to changes in fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  unrecognized firm commitments  an available for sale security or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in fair value under sfas depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in june  the fasb decided that the effective date for adopting the requirements of sfas should be delayed to fiscal years beginning after june  this delay  published as sfas  applies to quarterly and annual financial statements 
the company is currently evaluating the effect sfas will have on the results of its operations and its financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
management believes the company has complied with the provisions of sab no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the exposure of market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments is not material to ibis  as we do not transact our sales denominated in other than united states dollars  invest primarily in short term commercial paper  hold our investments until maturity and have not entered into hedging transactions
