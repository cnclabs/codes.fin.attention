results of operations years ended december   and total revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in our revenue growth was principally due to growth in cable modem revenue over the prior year 
unit sales of all our cable modem products increased from  as we experienced strong demand for our atm and docsis cable modems 
revenues associated with our headend products and network management software remained consistent with the prior year as we continued to expand our presence in north america  europe  asia and latin america 
cable modem sales accounted for of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in the average sales price of all cable modems declined during as expected 
our prices decreased due to planned price reductions to meet pricing pressures from competitors and the introduction of our lower priced docsis products 
we anticipate that the average sales price of modems will continue to decline during the average sales price of our headend equipment also declined during due to planned price reductions and mix of product sold 
we anticipate continued pricing pressure on our headend equipment and declines in our average sales price of headend products 
total revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in our revenue growth was principally due to growth in cable modem and headend equipment revenue 
we began product shipments during april and the volume of cable modems and headend product shipments increased significantly during  our first full year of product revenue 
cable modem sales accounted for of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in the average sales price of our cable modems declined during as expected 
our prices decreased primarily due to increased price competition 
the average sales price of our headend equipment increased moderately during primarily due to the mix of product sold 
gross margins 
gross margins decreased to in from in the decrease in margins is due primarily to the following during the fourth quarter of  we recognized million from a one time recognition of deferred revenue resulting from the expiration of a licensing agreement which led to a corresponding increase of million to our gross margin for the period 
during  we had no such one time increases to our revenues or gross margin 
as noted above  the product mix shifted from to  becoming more heavily weighted toward cable modems 
cable modems have lower margins than our other products 
this shift toward cable modems was partially offset by an increase to our cable modem margins from to  as our cost reduction programs outpaced the declines in our average sales prices 
gross margins decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin in was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of cable modems as a percentage of total product sales and a shift away from our higher margin software products  offset in part by the non recurring revenue of million of deferred revenue resulting from the expiration of a licensing agreement at december  during we anticipate continued margin pressure from the following increased sales of our docsis cable modems 
as these lower margin modems continue to become a higher percentage of our total revenue  we anticipate our total margin percentage will decline 
we do not anticipate making significant cost reductions to our docsis modems until the second half of competitive pricing offered by an increasing number of cable modem suppliers entering the market 
as the industry continues to move toward standardization of technology we anticipate increased pricing pressure 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased consulting and personnel related expenses related to product development 
during we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue investing in our product development activities 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in as a result of increased personnel in our research and development organization associated with product development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to higher costs associated with increased personnel in sales and marketing organizations 
we increased sales personnel internationally strengthening our sales presence in europe  asia and latin america  as well as domestically 
we also increased our customer service personnel to support the growth of our installed base of equipment and help manage our growing number of customers 
we added personnel to our marketing department as we expanded our marketing programs both domestically and internationally 
during  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our international sales presence and develop additional marketing programs and product channels for our docsis and dvb products 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to higher costs associated with increased personnel in sales and marketing organizations 
as was the first full year of product sales  we experienced increased selling efforts including travel expenses  trade shows  print advertising  public relations and promotional costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel in our finance and administrative organization 
this was offset by a decline in our legal fees associated with patent litigation which was settled in january we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars to support the activities of our growing company 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel in our finance and administrative organization as well as increased legal fees associated with patent litigation which was settled in january and increased professional fees associated with operation as a public company 
total other income  net 
total other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to earnings on higher average cash and investment balances during resulting from the net cash received of million from the initial public offering of common stock in may and the net cash received of million from the secondary offering of common stock in february total other income  net increased to million in from  in the increase was attributable to earnings on higher average cash and investment balances available during  resulting from the net cash received of million from the initial public offering of common stock in may liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase is primarily a result of cash generated from financing activities of million largely resulting from million in net proceeds received from the public offering of common stock in february and the exercise of stock options 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from operating activities of million and cash used for investing in property and equipment of million as well as net investment purchases of million 
the cash outflows from operating activities were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million and the million net loss for the year offset by an increase to accounts payable of million and an increase to accrued compensation and other current liabilities of million 
our capital requirements primarily relate to the working capital requirements and investments in property and equipment 
we have funded operations primarily through public offerings of common stock and private sales of common and preferred stock 
net cash used in operating activities in was million and resulted primarily from a net loss of million and the increase of million in inventories  offset in part by a total increase of million in accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities and million in depreciation and amortization expenses 
cash used in investing activities in of million consisted of million in capital expenditures primarily to support product development and manufacturing activities and net purchases of investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and  from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options 
net cash used in operating activities in was million and resulted primarily from a net loss of million and the increase of million and million in total accounts receivable and inventories  respectively  offset in part by a total increase of million in accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities and million in depreciation and amortization expenses 
cash used in investing activities in consisted of million in capital expenditures primarily to support product development and manufacturing activities 
cash flows from financing activities in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the issuance of series e preferred stock and series g preferred stock and  from the sale of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
other than capital and operating lease commitments  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  we anticipate an increase in capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we intend to establish additional sales  customer service and research offices and lease additional space  which will require us to commit to additional lease obligations  purchase equipment and install leasehold improvements 
we also intend to upgrade and invest in information technology that will increase capital expenditures 
in future periods  com anticipates significant increases in working capital on a period to period basis primarily as a result of planned increased product sales resulting in higher levels of inventory 
we contract for the manufacture of cable modems and integrated circuit boards on a turnkey basis 
we have a manufacturing agreement with celestica for the manufacture of certain of our products 
unless terminated by the parties  the agreement will extend for one year periods on december of each year 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our manufacturers that guarantee the availability of product  the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits 
our future success will depend  in significant part  on our ability to manufacture  or have others manufacture  our products successfully  cost effectively and in volumes sufficient to meet customer demand 
our dependence upon third party manufacturers involves a number of risks 
see risk factors we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we depend on third party manufacturers  their suppliers and oem suppliers and have limited manufacturing experience 
going forward  we may make cash investments or exchange com stock for investments in various companies to secure development resources or access to various product lines 
we may also more aggressively pursue market opportunities that leverage our technology platform 
these activities if pursued will result in a significant use of cash resources 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that time period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
com maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate debt obligations purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
com is also exposed to market price risk on an investment in a marketable equity security held as an available for sale investment 
this investment is in a publicly traded company in the volatile high technology industry sector 
a adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the investment in the marketable equity security as of december  no such marketable equity security was held as of december  
com also has fixed rate debt obligations of approximately million and  at december  and  respectively  that have no interest rate risk 
the fixed rates on such obligations ranged from to in and was in and mature on various dates through
