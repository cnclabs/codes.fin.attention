year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the national security group the company was  in compared to million in on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in the decrease in net income was due to poor operating results in the company s property casualty subsidiaries operations 
the operating results of the subsidiaries are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
realized capital gains in were million compared to million in consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in revenues were down for the year due to a decrease in property and casualty insurance premiums 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other is summarized as follows premium revenues life and accident and health insurance 
   property and casualty insurance    income before taxes and cumulative effect adjustment life and accident and health insurance    property and casualty insurance    other life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was million compared to million in operating results for were very similar to  with slightly higher realized capital gains producing the modest increase in income before income tax 
nsic experienced a increase in premium income primarily due to increased sales of life insurance through independent agents 
the company began offering life and accident insurance products through independent agents in prior to nsic used employee agents as its only method of distribution of life and accident insurance products 
the increase in premium revenues also produced an increase in commission expense 
first year commissions are paid at a higher rate than commissions paid in succeeding years 
the increase in premium revenues was produced entirely by sales of new insurance policies  and consequently increased commission expense 
as these policies renew in succeeding years  commissions on these policies will decrease 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in were million compared to million in the increase in pretax income was primarily due to a decrease in agents commissions and litigation expenses 
premium income was million in compared to million in premium income began stabilizing in after five consecutive years of rapid decline 
property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income before income tax was million in compared to a pretax loss of million in an improvement in underwriting results and reduced litigation expenses were the major factors contributing to the improvement in pretax income 
nsfc had much improved underwriting results in the dwelling property lines of insurance compared to in nsfc incurred over million in tornado losses  while in tornado losses were minimal 
nsfc also did not incur any significant hurricane losses in in nsfc incurred over million in hurricane losses 
the decrease in hurricane and tornado losses of over million led to much improved underwriting results in compared to the automobile insurance programs had underwriting losses of over million in several of these programs which were managed by independent managing general agents have been discontinued over the last year and management believes that future losses from the discontinued programs will be greatly reduced compared to losses incurred in and one program managed by a managing general agent is still in operation in florida  but management has taken steps to minimize additional losses from this program 
company management expects to maintain a presence in the automobile insurance market  but future growth and expansion will be through the traditional independent agents with claims and underwriting functions managed and closely monitored by in house personnel 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pretax losses were million in compared to pretax income of million in several catastrophe losses and a litigation settlement during had a major impact on the results of property and casualty insurance operations 
one of the property and casualty subsidiaries  nsfc  was hit by natural disaster losses in the first and last half of the year 
during the first six months of  nsfc incurred over million in tornado losses 
the most severe tornado loss was in jefferson county  alabama in the spring of this single tornado  which was reported to be a category f tornado with winds of over miles per hour  caused over  in damage to nsfc policyholders 
in the last half of nsfc was hit by hurricane georges which hit the gulf coast of alabama and mississippi and caused over million in incurred losses 
in total  hurricane losses accounted for of all property and casualty losses 
however  even though catastrophe losses were substantial in  nsfc s low value dwelling line of business  which was hit with a majority of these catastrophe losses  ended the year with a combined ratio of less than 
nsfc had no significant catastrophic losses in nsfc also settled a long standing lawsuit in which decreased pretax earnings by over million 
this settlement is discussed in further detail in note of the financial statements 
the most significant operating result in the property and casualty subsidiaries was the continued poor performance of the subsidiaries private passenger and commercial automobile programs 
the combined ratio of these programs  which produced over million in earned premium  was over 
pretax losses from these automobile programs totaled over million 
two of the programs  both in louisiana  have been discontinued 
the remaining in force policies from a private passenger auto program expired in late  and in early  a commercial taxi program in louisiana was discontinued 
the remaining in force policies from this program expired in mid based on previous loss experience  the taxi program is expected to incur losses in excess of earned premium until the remaining policies expire 
these two programs accounted for pretax losses of million 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the statutory combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums written during the year 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for was substantially higher than due to catastrophe losses and very unfavorable underwriting results in private passenger and commercial automobile lines of business 
catastrophe losses from hurricane georges and tornadoes increased the combined ratio by over 
however  the most significant impact on the combined ratio was the poor underwriting results from the automobile lines of business  which had a combined ratio of over 
losses  adjustment expenses  and underwriting expenses in excess of earned premium on the automobile programs increase the combined ratio for all lines of business by over percentage points 
asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents of total svo class moody s standard and poor s bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c c ci to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
market risk disclosures since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities  and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities provided used cash of  million  million in   and respectively 
those statements also classify the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities  and financing activities and disclose the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet the company s obligations 
an increase in net income and a decrease in reinsurance balances recoverable were the primary sources of the increase in cash flow for an increase in claim payments was a primary use of cash in operating activities for a large decrease in reinsurance recoveries of million are the major causes of a million increase in cash provided from operations in the company has standby letters of credit of less than  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
the letters of credit are secured by certain invested assets of the company 
the company also routinely incurs liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
the company has notes payable of million at december  the notes payable are to repaid in quarterly installments over five years 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to million in the life insurance subsidiary and million in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula will be used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of four to one at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
year issue the company completed all year date conversations prior to december   and has experienced no major problems or disruptions of business due to the year issue
