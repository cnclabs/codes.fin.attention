in assigning a benefit period to goodwill  the company considers regulatory provisions  the technological environment in which the acquired company operates  including barriers to new competing entities  the maturity of the products manufactured by the businesses acquired  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
the company has determined that no events or circumstances occurred in to warrant revised estimates of the goodwill benefit period 
impact of year as a result of planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems due to the year date change

introduction of euro currency on january   the euro was introduced in eleven of the fifteen economic and monetary union countries 
the company has affiliates located in the following countries which participated in the euro introduction finland  italy  the netherlands  and spain

the company does not believe the conversion to the euro and the cost of implementing required system changes will be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
the company is not a party to any material derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary foreign markets served by the company s affiliates are in australia  latin america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company s affiliates operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency ebit generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency ebit generally increases 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to mitigate the economic effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on that portion of foreign currency ebit which is expected to be invested elsewhere or remitted to the parent company 
the company s foreign affiliates generally invest their excess funds in us dollars or dollar based instruments  where such instruments are available with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  however  this strategy exposes the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company believes that the benefit of investing excess cash in us dollars or their equivalent outweighs the risk of reporting losses or gains from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in those countries with hyper inflationary economies  where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  this investment strategy for excess funds mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains 
because most of the company s foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable 
consid erations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrow ings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company s bank credit agreement provides for a billion loan revolving facility which is available to certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries and denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as of december   amounts outstanding under the offshore loan revolving facility were as follows millions of foreign currency amount us dollars billion australian dollars million british pounds billion italian lire the remaining portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its foreign affiliates 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates  the company could  at its option  convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps 
the following table provides information about the company s significant interest rate risk at december  outstanding fair value millions of dollars variable rate debt bank credit agreement  matures december revolving loans and bid rate loans bear interest at a eurodollar based rate plus 
  offshore loans bear interest at the applicable offshore base rate as defined in the bank credit agreement as follows billion australian dollars million british pounds billion italian lira fixed rate debt senior notes due may  interest at due may  interest at due may  interest at due may  interest at senior debentures due may  interest at due may  interest at forward looking statements this document may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements reflect the company s best assessment at the time  and thus involve uncertainty and risk
