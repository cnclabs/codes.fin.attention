item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as note  segment reporting  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
processing and related services appalachian core area the company owns and operates in appalachia four gas processing facilities  one fractionation plant  a ngl pipeline and two propane terminals 
certain information concerning the appalachian assets is summarized in the following tables for the year ended year december  acquired or placed gas ngl production into throughput throughput throughput plant facilities location service capacity mcfd gal year boldman extraction plant pike county  ky  mcfd   cobb extraction plant kanawha county  wv  mcfd   kenova extraction plant wayne county  wv  mcfd   maytown extraction plant floyd county  ky  mcfd siloam fractionation plant south shore  ky  gal d n a  year sales for the acquired year ended or placed throughput storage december  storage and into length capacity capacity transmission facilities location service in miles gal d gal gal siloam fractionation storage south shore  ky n a n a   terminal and storage lynchburg  va n a n a   terminal and storage church hill  tn n a n a   kenova to siloam pipeline wayne county  wv to  n a n a south shore  ky maytown to kenova pipeline lincoln county to  n a n a wayne county  wv markwest assumed operations effective february  previously  boldman was leased to and operated by a third party 
cobb was acquired march  cobb was originally placed in service in and its extracted ngls have historically been fractionated at siloam 
includes fractionation of ngls extracted at kenova  boldman and cobb listed above 
maytown was placed into service in february maytown can be expanded to  mcfd for a modest amount of capital 
lynchburg was acquired on november  sales volumes are for the november   through december   time period 
a portion of the pipeline is leased from a third party 
the company s appalachian operations are in the midst of a sizable expansion  growing production from  gallons per day in to  gallons per day by mid see significant developments earlier in this section for further information 
the company believes this region has favorable supply and demand characteristics 
the appalachian core area is geographically situated between the tet pipeline to the north and the dixie pipeline to the south 
the historical demand for ngl products in appalachia has exceeded local production and the capacity of these two lines during peak winter periods 
this factor has enabled ngl suppliers in appalachia principally markwest  marathon ashland petroleum llc and cng transmission corporation to price their products particularly propane at a premium to gulf coast spot prices  especially during winter high demand periods 
there are approximately  wells behind the company s ngl extraction plants in appalachia 
this producing basin is one of the country s oldest  but is still one of the most prolific 
in fact  gas volumes continue to grow to new records each year  as producers increase the number of new wells drilled each year 
growing production drilling can be attributed to higher gas prices in an area close to the high demand northeast us  improved drilling technologies  and cost reductions  all of which add up to improved economic returns for producers 
there are tens of thousands of proved but undrilled locations in appalachia  which bodes well for future expansion of markwest s strategically located  cost effective processing and marketing assets 
the kenova  boldman  cobb and maytown plants extract liquids from natural gas for further separation at the company s siloam fractionator 
all of the ngls recovered at the kenova  maytown and boldman plants beginning february  boldman ngls are transported to maytown via tanker trucks are sent to siloam via pipeline 
cobb liquids are transported to siloam via tanker trucks 
at the company s siloam fractionation plant  extracted ngls are separated into ngl products  including propane  isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline 
in addition to processing and ngl marketing  the company engages in terminaling and storage of ngls in a number of ngl storage complexes in the central and eastern united states and owns and operates propane terminals in virginia  tennessee  and  beginning march  ohio 
markwest has contracted with producers for the exclusive right to process the producers hydrocarbon rich gas currently delivered into producer owned and columbia owned transmission pipelines upstream of the company s plants under long term contracts 
markwest also has long term operating agreements with columbia 
the company currently processes natural gas under contracts containing both keep whole and fee components 
in keep whole arrangements  the company s principal cost is the reimbursement to the natural gas producers for the btus extracted from the gas stream in the form of liquids or consumed as fuel during processing 
in such cases  the company creates operating margins by maximizing the value of the ngls extracted from the natural gas stream and minimizing the cost of replacement btus 
while the company maintains programs to minimize the cost to deliver the replacement btus to the natural gas supplier  the company s margins under keep whole contracts can be negatively affected by either decreases in ngl prices or increases in prices of replacement natural gas 
processing contracts with producers also contain a fee component under which the producers pay markwest a fee to process their gas and provide a portion of their gas for fuel 
the fee may be a per unit of throughput charge or a percentage of the resulting ngl sales percent of proceeds or some combination of both 
until  substantially all of the company s fractionation services in its appalachian core area are provided under keep whole contracts 
the contract for processing services at the new maytown plant contains fee and percent of proceeds components 
the company attempts to maximize the value of its ngl output by marketing directly to distributors  resellers  blenders  refiners and petrochemical companies 
the company minimizes the use of third party brokers and instead supports a direct marketing staff focused on multistate and independent dealers 
additionally  the company uses its own trailer and railcar fleet  as well as its own terminals and storage facilities  to enhance supply reliability to its customers 
all of these efforts have allowed the company to maintain premium pricing for the majority of its ngl products compared to gulf coast spot prices 
the majority of the company s sales of ngls are based on spot prices at the time the ngls are sold 
spot market prices are based upon prices and volumes negotiated for short terms  typically days 
the company is increasing its hedging activities as described in note  commodity price risk management  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
historically  the majority of the company s operating income has been derived from processing and related services in its appalachian core area 
revenues from the sale of appalachian ngls represented   and of gathering  processing and marketing revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  the company started a natural gas marketing group to provide  primarily in appalachia  more services to natural gas producers  source new gas for the company s facilities  minimize its replacement btu cost  and assist with its business development efforts 
the company s natural gas marketing activities are fundamentally high volume  low margin transactions executed in support of markwest s processing business 
consequently  an increasing percentage of the company s overall revenues stem from gas marketing 
for the years ended december   and    and  respectively  of gathering  processing and marketing revenue stemmed from gas marketing 
michigan core area for the year ended year december  acquired or placed throughput gas ngl production into capacity throughput throughput facilities location service mcfd mcfd gal year mile sour gas gathering manistee  mason and   n a pipeline oceana counties  mi fisk gas plant manistee county  mi    extended from miles in to miles in and miles in the company s operations in western michigan consist of a pipeline and processing plant 
the company s gas gathering pipeline gathers and transports sour gas to a treatment plant  used to remove sulphur  owned and operated by a third party 
markwest s fisk processing plant is located adjacent to the third party s treating plant 
the fisk plant processes all of the natural gas gathered by the pipeline and treated by the third party s treating plant  producing propane and other liquid products 
the plant also conditions the residue gas such that it can be sold directly into the michigan consolidated gas company dry distribution system serving western michigan 
the company currently processes natural gas in western michigan under contracts containing both fee and percent of proceeds components 
the processing contracts with producers contain a fee component under which the producers pay markwest a fee to transport and treat their gas 
under the percent of proceeds component  the company retains a portion of the ngls as compensation for the processing services provided 
operating revenues earned by the company under percent of proceeds contracts increase proportionately with the price of ngls sold 
the company generally sells its propane production as soon as it is produced 
the company s butane natural gasoline production is transported across the state via tanker trucks to the marysville fractionator  where it is separated into ngl products  including isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline 
since commencing operations in  throughput volumes have steadily risen 
throughput volumes in were mmcfd  up over volumes 
year throughput volumes are expected to be about the same as s throughput volumes  without considering year drilling programs 
low commodity prices in and the first half of have curtailed producer capital programs 
consequently  little drilling took place in western michigan in new drilling is critical to maintaining and increasing volumes 
drilling activity in the next few years will determine the sustainable production level for the project 
while drilling activity and drilling success have been slow to develop  markwest s own exploration efforts  along with third party partners  continue to identify good prospects along the mile pipeline corridor 
markwest expects to drill and evaluate a minimum of three additional reefs by the end of second quarter markwest has exclusive gathering  treatment and processing agreements with certain producers 
expected natural gas streams dedicated under these agreements will primarily be produced from an extension of the northern niagaran reef trend in western michigan 
to date  over trillion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas has been produced from the northern niagaran reef trend 
substantially all of the natural gas produced from the western region of this trend  however  is sour 
in the past  while several successful large wells were developed in the region  the natural gas producers lacked adequate gathering and treatment facilities for sour gas  and development of the trend stopped in northern manistee county 
however  with the company s recently expanded infrastructure of the sour gas pipeline  treatment and processing facilities and increased capacity  the company has seen and believes there could continue to be increased development in the region 
in addition  the company believes that improvements in seismic technology may increase exploration and production efforts  as well as drilling success rates 
in eastern michigan  the company contracted with a producer to provide gas processing services for a long dormant sour gas formation 
markwest also has a working interest in the field 
in the first phase of the project  markwest is obtaining required permits  constructing a well facility  modifying an existing gas plant and constructing a pipeline to bring an existing well into production from this formation 
it is anticipated that the first phase will be completed by mid second quarter at a cost to markwest of million 
the second phase of the project is expected to begin in late or early and will involve bringing another four wells into production and constructing additional processing facilities 
these wells have never produced from this formation due to the lack of infrastructure 
management believes the project has the potential to grow into a significant contributor to markwest 
exploration and production rocky mountain core area markwest has focused its exploration and production business in rocky mountain coal seam natural gas development primarily in the san juan basin 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  markwest sold its interest in three non core properties for million  and reinvested million for a interest in properties and gathering systems that overlap its existing san juan basin properties 
in  nearly million was spent  primarily in the second and third quarters  on high return workover activities on the purchased wells to improve production 
net natural gas sold in the fourth quarter of averaged mmcfd  representing a percent increase from the same period last year  and for the year averaged mmcfd  up percent 
this increase reflects production acquired in the first quarter of net of disposed production and the benefit realized from the capital program 
during the fourth quarter  markwest received approval for additional down spaced coal wells in the san juan basin resulting in approximately twenty additional development locations 
as these wells are completed over the next two years  markwest expects an additional mmcfd net to its percent interest 
it is anticipated that future spacing requests for other producing horizons in markwest s san juan basin properties could yield another twenty development locations 
michigan core area for discussion on drilling programs  see processing and related services michigan core area appearing earlier in items and of this form k 
seasonality a substantial portion of the company s revenues and  as a result  its gross margins  remains dependent upon the sales price of ngls  particularly propane  which fluctuates with the winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
the strongest demand for propane and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  the company recognizes a substantial portion of its annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
competition the company faces competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related services operations  in obtaining unprocessed ngls for fractionation  and in marketing its products and services 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants  operating efficiency and reliability  and ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered 
competitive factors affecting the company s fractionation services include availability of capacity  proximity to supply and to industry marketing centers  and cost efficiency and reliability of service 
competition for customers is based primarily on price  delivery capabilities  flexibility  and maintenance of quality customer relationships 
the company s principal competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies  major interstate pipeline companies  national and local gas gatherers  ngl processing companies  brokers  marketers and distributors of varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
many of the company s competitors  such as major oil and gas and pipeline companies  have capital resources and control supplies of natural gas substantially greater than that of the company 
smaller local distributors may enjoy a marketing advantage in their immediate service areas 
drilling activity behind the company s systems varies with industry conditions  commodity prices  and effectively competes for capital with producers other drilling opportunities 
operational risks and insurance the company s operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the exploration for and production  gathering  transmission  processing and storage of natural gas and ngls  such as explosions  product spills  leaks  emissions and fires 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  and pollution or other environmental damage  and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility 
the company maintains general public liability  property and business interruption insurance in amounts that it considers to be adequate for such risks 
such insurance is subject to deductibles that the company considers reasonable and not excessive 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  the company s insurance policies provide coverage for losses or liabilities related to sudden occurrences of pollution or other environmental damage 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against  and or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
moreover  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable 
to date  however  the company has experienced no material uninsured losses or any difficulty in acquiring insurance coverage in amounts it believes to be adequate 
government regulation in the michigan core area  the company owns and operates a gathering pipeline in conjunction with its processing plant 
under the natural gas act of  facilities that have as their primary function the performance of gathering activities and are not owned by interstate gas pipeline companies are wholly exempt from federal energy regulatory commission jurisdiction 
state and local regulatory authorities oversee intrastate gathering and other natural gas pipeline operations 
the michigan public service commission mpsc regulates the construction  operation  rates and safety of certain natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines pursuant to state regulatory statutes 
the company conducts gas pipeline operations in michigan through an affiliate  which is subject to this regulation by the mpsc 
the design  construction  operation and maintenance of the company s pipeline is also subject to safety regulations 
natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of gas available to the company s systems or which the company can produce from its wells 
they also substantially affect the cost and profitability of conducting natural gas exploration and production activities 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental risks normally incident to its operations and construction activities including  but not limited to  uncontrollable flows of natural gas  fluids and other substances into the environment  explosions  fires  pollution  and other environmental and safety risks 
the following is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various federal  state and local statutes  rules  regulations  or orders to which the company s operations may be subject 
for example  the company  without regard to fault  could incur liability under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended also known as the superfund law  or state counterparts  in connection with the disposal or other releases of hazardous substances  including sour gas  and for natural resource damages 
further  the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulations is toward stricter standards  and this will likely continue in the future 
the company s activities are subject to environmental and safety regulation by federal and state authorities  including  without limitation  the state environmental agencies and the federal environmental protection agency  which can increase the costs of designing  installing and operating its facilities 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements relate to the discharge of substances into the environment and include measures to control water and air pollution 
laws and regulations may require a permit or other authorization before certain activities may be conducted by the company and include fines and penalties for non compliance 
further  these rules may limit or prohibit activities within wilderness areas  wetlands  and areas providing habitat for certain species or other protected areas 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local laws covering the handling  storage or discharge of materials used by the company 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  overview 
for the year ended december   markwest reported net income of million  or per share  on revenues of million  a million increase in net income over s net loss of million  or per share  on revenues of million 
aside from the company s million  or per share  after tax gain on the sale of the company s west memphis terminal  record ngl production and sales in appalachia  contributing an incremental million after tax in  coupled with improving appalachian processing margins  contributing an incremental million after tax in  were the primary reasons behind the company s return to profitability in markwest sold million gallons of ngls in  a increase over levels  as gas production increased behind the company s facilities 
appalachian processing margins averaged per gallon in  up over  but still significantly below the company s per gallon ten year historical average 
increased ngl prices contributed to improving margins 
increased profitability from markwest s terminals  due to increased ngl sales prices  and michigan operations  due to increased throughput and ngl sales prices  contributed an incremental million after tax in expected increases in operating  general and administrative  interest and depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses reduced after tax results an incremental million in gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the revenue increase was principally attributable to a million increase in the company s gas marketing operations 
at the company s siloam fractionation facility  higher ngl sales prices and larger volumes of ngls marketed contributed an incremental million and million  respectively  to revenues 
oil and gas revenue 
oil and gas revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gas production from the prior year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily caused by a million increase in gas marketing purchases 
at the company s siloam fractionation facility  both higher natural gas costs and larger volumes of natural gas purchased contributed an incremental million and million  respectively  to cost of sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses was principally attributable to four factors 
first  certain expenses increased with volumes in appalachia  michigan and the rocky mountains 
second  markwest sold and leased back three compressors at its kenova processing plant beginning in the third quarter of consequently  operating expenses include twelve full months of lease expense whereas the results from the comparable time period in do not 
further  these compressors were overhauled in third  operating expenses were lower due to a sales and use tax refund during that period 
last  performance based incentive compensation increased in  markwest did not pay bonuses in due to the company s overall net loss 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to increased performance based incentive compensation markwest did not pay bonuses in due to the company s overall net loss  professional service fees also increased in due to the company s arbitration with columbia  now since settled  and to increased business development expenditures 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the company s pipeline extension in michigan placed in service during mid interest expense 
interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to increased average outstanding debt and higher interest rates 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  overview 
for the year ended december   markwest reported a net loss of million  or per share  on revenues of million 
these results compare to net income of million  or per share  on revenues of million for the same period in the net loss in  compared to net income in  largely resulted from a reduction of million  or per share  in after tax gas processing margins 
appalachia s full year gas processing margin of per gallon was approximately below its ten year average and down by compared to s average of per gallon 
the decrease in margin was due to a combination of weak ngl prices  which resulted from lower crude oil prices  and relatively strong natural gas costs that negatively impacted the entire natural gas processing industry 
michigan s after tax operating income totaled million for  or per share  up from break even in increases in depreciation  depletion and amortization  and net interest expense were largely offset by savings in operating costs and general and administrative costs 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the company s appalachian operations accounted for the majority of the overall revenue decrease  primarily as a result of weak ngl prices in compared to in addition  fee gas processed in only includes volumes processed at the company s kenova plant beginning march  in and early  fee gas processed included volumes at the boldman and cobb plants in addition to the kenova plant 
the loss of fee revenue is partly offset by cost savings realized from not operating boldman and cobb 
the above factors were partially offset by an increase in the volume of gas processed in the company s michigan operations during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  gas processed in the company s michigan operations contributed both fee based processing income and revenues from the sale of propane and other liquids extracted at the company s new ngl extraction plant  which began operations in january oil and gas revenue 
oil and gas revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gas production from the prior year 
interest income 
interest income decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during  interest income was primarily derived from a note receivable for the costs incurred by the company for the construction of the mile extension to the gas pipeline in michigan  which was completed in during  the note was forgiven in exchange for the title to the pipeline extension 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the company s appalachian operations accounted for the majority of the decrease  primarily as a result of a decrease in the unit cost of propane at the company s terminals 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  in response to low processing margins  the company implemented cost controlling measures and consequently reduced operating costs during  compared to additionally  the company had lower performance based incentive compensation expense in due to the company s overall net loss 
these decreases were partially offset by the introduction of operational costs from the company s new ngl extraction plant in michigan for a full year during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general and administrative expenses incurred during included a continuation of many initial costs  including significant professional service fees  incurred in connection with the company s reorganization into a public company following the initial public offering in october in addition  in response to low processing margins throughout  the company implemented cost controlling measures and consequently reduced general and administrative expenses 
finally  the company had lower performance based incentive compensation expense in due to the company s overall net loss 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to increased depreciation attributable to the company s new ngl extraction plant and pipeline extension in michigan 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to an increase in average outstanding long term debt in compared to liquidity and capital resources for the past three years  the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources have been internal cash flow  its revolving line of credit  and  in  proceeds from the sale of the company s west memphis terminal 
markwest believes its ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in its business is one of its fundamental financial strengths 
the company anticipates that its operating activities in  coupled with selective asset sales and existing bank credit arrangements  will continue to provide adequate cash flows for its business expansion and to meet its financial commitments 
the consolidated statements of our cash flows  detailed in the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  are summarized as follows in s for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities before change in working capital    net cash provided by operating activities from change in working capital   net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    cash provided by operating activities before change in working capital in amounted to million  a increase from  primarily due to increased gas processing margins and volumes at the company s appalachian facilities 
in  cash provided by operating activities before change in working capital amounted to million  a decrease from this increase resulted from a decrease in gas processing margins at markwest s appalachian plants in capital investment program investing activities consist primarily of capital and acquisition expenditures and sales of assets 
and programs were of similar size 
the company s capital expenditures are summarized as follows in s for the year ended december  appalachia phase i expansion terminal and storage facilities rocky mountains exploration and production western michigan pipeline expansion fisk extraction plant exploration and production eastern michigan au gres project purchase of office building maintenance capital and other total capital expenditures looking ahead  markwest is anticipating a baseline capital budget of million in and million in this budget will fund the completion of phase i and phase ii expansion in appalachia and other requirements  including michigan drilling and maintenance capital 
in addition  markwest is targeting another million in other new projects and acquisitions 
management believes that funds generated from operations  the february sale of the company s office building for million in net cash proceeds  and unused borrowing capacity will enable the company to fund its capital expenditure programs 
financing facilities financing activities consist primarily of net borrowings under the company s credit facility  which is described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
at december   the company had approximately million of available credit  of which net debt of million had been utilized as of december   and working capital of million 
as progressed  the company s credit availability increased as the trailing cash flow calculation  the determinant of the company s available credit  rose because of improvements in appalachia processing margins 
in addition  the company sold its corporate office building in february for million in net proceeds to further increase its financial flexibility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces market risk from commodity price variations  primarily in the ngls it sells and in the natural gas it purchases 
it also incurs  to a lesser extent  credit risks and risks related to interest rate variations 
commodity price risk 
in the past  ngl prices and natural gas costs have fluctuated widely in response to changing market forces 
the impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from natural gas processing and marketing activities have been significant and have varied from year to year 
currently markwest s appalachian operations have an annual sensitivity to ngl prices equal to million in pretax income for every per gallon change in ngl prices and an annual sensitivity to natural gas prices equal to million in pretax income for every mmbtu change in natural gas prices 
for  the company has hedged approximately of its appalachian keep whole volumes as of february   reducing the annual sensitivity accordingly 
the company typically hedges a portion of its commodity price risk 
gains and losses experienced on hedging transactions are generally offset by the related gains or losses on the sale of the underlying product in the physical market 
see related discussion in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
credit risk 
the company is exposed to potential losses as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
the company maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk 
such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
the company also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its long term debt with floating interest rates 
the company may make use of interest rate swap agreements to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio  although no such agreements are currently in place 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on the company s debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s variable rate debt balances as of december
