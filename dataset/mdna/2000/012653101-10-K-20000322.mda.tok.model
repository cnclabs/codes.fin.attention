outlook we enjoyed volume growth in a majority of our businesses during but were impacted by competitive lower pricing in a few  especially flame retardants 
the asian economy  that started out slow early in  fueled a number of our businesses in the latter half of and continues into the emphasis on reducing costs during that included employee work force reductions  manufacturing cost improvements and reducing our cash to cash cycle  should payout during in the form of reduced sg a  lower factory costs and reduced working capital 
in our operating segments  polymer and fine chemicals  we are hopeful we will continue to see strong volumes and that the recently announced price increases  primarily in certain polymer chemicals areas  will be successful 
however  because of various customer contractual agreements  it is unlikely to expect much improvement in price until after the first quarter 
in fine chemicals  where a few of our businesses were negatively impacted throughout most of by either poor economic conditions ie  agrichemicals or issues at major customers ie  pharmachemicals  we have some optimism there will be some improvement in however  we will need first to see some evidence these conditions are no longer affecting us 
two new recent events  our joint development agreement with the borax flame retardant group on expanding our markets for flame retardants  and our just announced plan to buy ferro s pyro chek r flame retardants business  are either in an early stage or not yet completed and  therefore  it is premature to assess any impact in we did have new product sales in of approximately million and expect this to grow in our polymer chemicals businesses likely will be providing the majority of the increase 
polymer chemicals efforts to supply the leading polymer producers with winning solutions for their customers were quite successful in this was especially evident in flame retardants  where to a large extent  we believe our growth in volumes was a direct result of our customers winning business in their markets 
we will strive to continue to expand our global relationships with these strategic customers in the acceptance of our new  improved quality tetrabrombisphenol a by approximately of our customer base by the end of  is a prime example of how this works 
we expect to have essentially all our customers qualified on this new product in early also at the end of  we introduced ncendx tm p flame retardant  our first halogen free flame retardant 
this product  commercialized in less than a year and targeted for engineering plastics  has been well received by our key customers and already is being considered for expansion to meet likely demand beyond during the first half of  we experienced significant pressures at strategic customers  dramatically reducing the global industry pricing on our largest volume flame retardants for the balance of the year 
at the end of  we announced price increases 
because of customer contractual commitments and the uncertainty of competitive persistence with these increases  it is premature to predict success but in any event  unlikely that we will see any impact until at least after the first quarter of in our catalysts and additives businesses  we saw strong volume growth in and are hopeful that strong polymer market growth  new business development opportunities and the rapidly expanding metallocene and single site catalyst demand in polyolefins  will continue to drive these products in this new catalysts area has been one of the company s largest r d programs for a number of years  and in  we should achieve positive operating profit for the first time 
fine chemicals in pharmachemicals  we are continuing to pursue our marketing strategy of seeking strategic customer relationships where we can build on our technical strengths and customer needs for a manufacturing outsource partner in bulk actives or advanced intermediates 
there are some very attractive opportunities under development but due to the rigorous testing and regulations required to bring these to the consumer drug market  the benefit from these  if successful  will not be realized in in our commercial products  we will still be facing a slower than expected scale up of our naproxen plant due to excess naproxen capacity  threats from imported products and a consumer marketplace that has an overabundance of competing analgesic products 
ibuprofen is entering from a low volume year  having absorbed the impact of a major customer having excess inventory accumulated in late that was drawn down in it is our belief that volumes will return in  consistent with a consumer ibuprofen market that continues to grow at per year 
we faced the effects of a poor domestic farm economy during  when lower volumes of agrichemicals were used by the american farmer 
we are prepared for to be similar in consumption patterns and not a resumption to historic pre levels 
we believe  however  we will have an opportunity in the future to expand our presence in asia  especially china  where we formed an agrichemical joint venture in with yanshan petrochemical 
we continue to produce methyl bromide under production limits set by the government as defined by the montreal protocol phase down schedule limits are not changed from under the plan 
in  we will be producing methyl bromide using certain assets from the old tetrabrombisphenol a plant that remained at the end of when the new cp flame retardant facility started up 
bromine and derivatives results in will be determined largely by the oil industry  as our business has turned around significantly in the latter half of and is expected to continue into with the higher price of oil  the main driver for oil companies well completions  where the majority of our products are used 
continued expansion of our oilfield chemicals business in the north sea  leveraging our teesport  united kingdom location  plus developing new opportunities  will be a factor in the cost benefits from lower chlorine and other raw material prices during are not expected to be as favorable in due to recent price announcements 
we expect later in  site construction will begin in jordan by jbc  on our joint venture facility that will produce bromine and derivatives 
the newest developments in our surface actives business are primarily based on our biocide products in our water treatment business 
we received registrations in and have eight more pending as we enter we introduced and are preparing for commercial sales of stabrom r biocide in early  a new class of bromine biocides that simplifies industrial water treatment 
some key issues going into include competitive pressures in builders for detergents and startup costs associated with new product introductions 
potassium and chlorine chemicals results in will be primarily dependent on competitive pricing opportunities and cost reduction efforts 
outlook in summary  we believe we should be able to deliver mid single digit sales revenue growth from our polymer and fine chemicals businesses plus new business development and small acquisitions and ventures 
this assumes that some of the pricing improvements  cost reduction efforts and new product developments as described above are successful 
this also assumes that the volume growth currently seen in our business  supported by the strong global economy  continues without substantial change

see note  long term debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on pages and for details of the company s long term borrowings 
the company  at december   had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of million million outstanding at december  under its competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants typical for a credit agreement of its size and nature  including financial covenants requiring the company to maintain consolidated indebtedness as defined of not more than of the sum of the company s consolidated shareholders equity as defined and consolidated indebtedness 
the amount and timing of any borrowings will depend on the company s specific cash requirements 
the company s foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity on page at december   decreased from december   primarily due to the weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
capital expenditures in of million were slightly higher than the level of million 
the company s capital spending program is expected to be in the million range over the next few years  with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be less than the current year 
future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities  with the balance  if necessary  provided by additional long term debt 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities and or businesses  particularly in areas where our know how adds value 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to the company s knowledge  it is currently complying with and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
such compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company 
in de minimis prp matters  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 as clarified by the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
the company s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december   totaled approximately million 
there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to million before income taxes 
however  the company believes that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in a particular reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects for the company  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects are likely to be less than the current year expenditures 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 
year albemarle s company wide year project project addressed the ability of computer programs and embedded computer chips to distinguish between the year and the year re engineering of the company s business processes  which began in the mid s  resulted in upgrades to yk compliant business systems prior to the beginning of the year project 
the project s remediation and contingency planning functions were completed during the fourth quarter of since the company s products are not date aware  its year issues revolved around its suppliers ability to supply goods and services  its ability to produce  its business processes functioning properly  and its customers ability to purchase 
as part of the company s contingency planning  most production processes were interrupted intentionally as a precaution for the transition into the year as of the date of filing of this document  the company has experienced no significant internal or external yk problems affecting its manufacturing  business  financial or other operations 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become year ready and year related contingency planning was million 
while the company does not track internal manpower costs for its year project  an estimate of these costs is included in the estimated total cost 
the estimate does not include albemarle s share of year costs incurred by joint ventures in which the company participates or entities in which the company holds a minority interest 
the company did not significantly increase inventories for the transition into the year the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations  which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of uncertain market conditions  and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact on earnings of future periods 
the company s financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net liability position of 
million at december  the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods
