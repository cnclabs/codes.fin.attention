item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements  as a result of various factors including those described below in risks relating to our business 
overview the following is a discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our results of operations and financial condition during the period included in the accompanying financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and associated notes 
in october  we acquired environmental optical sensors  inc eosi  a provider of high precision assembly and test equipment for the fiber optic communications market 
in october  we acquired the west coast commercial optics operation of corning oca corporation  a subsidiary of corning incorporated renamed newport precision optics corporation or npoc  which manufactures specialized precision optical products and systems 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this form k 
this discussion includes the effect of our acquisitions of eosi for and  and the effect of our acquisition of npoc for amounts in include net sales of million representing one extra month of sales from our european operations 
the additional net sales stem from a reporting change in the second quarter of that eliminated a one month lag in the reporting of european results 
without the change  net sales would have been million  while net income would not have been materially different 
earnings per share were not impacted by the change 
results of operations financial analysis the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percent of our net sales and as period to period percent increases or decreases period to period percent of net sales increase decrease net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income net sales for  and  our net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net sales for increased million  or  as compared with  due page primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and semiconductor markets  offset partially by decreases in sales to the computer peripherals and aerospace and research markets 
net sales for increased million  or  as compared with  due primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and research markets  offset in part by sales declines in the semiconductor and computer peripherals markets 
our sales to the fiber optic communications market segment in were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with our sales to the industrial metrology market in were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the prior year 
our sales to the aerospace and research market were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared with in  our sales to the fiber optic communications market were million  an increase of million  or  over our sales to the industrial metrology market segment were million  a decrease of million  or  versus our sales to the aerospace and research market were million  an increase of million  or  over for  and  domestic sales were million  million and million  respectively 
domestic sales in increased million  or  versus  due primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and semiconductor markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively  offset partially by a decrease of million  or  in sales to the computer peripherals market and a decrease of million  or  in sales to the aerospace and research market 
domestic sales in increased million  or  as compared with  due principally to sales increases of million  or  and million  or  to the fiber optic communications and aerospace and research markets  respectively  offset partially by sales declines in the semiconductor and computer peripherals markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the domestic semiconductor and computer peripherals markets were negatively impacted by the economic situation in asia and overcapacity throughout much of  both of which resulted in lower demand for the capital equipment we supply to these markets 
international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  international sales increased million  or  versus international sales in included net sales of million representing one extra month of sales from our european operations  due to a reporting change in the second quarter of that eliminated a one month lag in the reporting of european results 
without such change  international sales would have been million 
the increase in international sales in as compared with was due primarily to an increase of million  or  in sales to international fiber optic communications customers  an increase of million  or  in sales of metrology products to international life and health science oem customers  and an increase in international sales to the semiconductor market of million  or  offset in part by a decline in sales to international aerospace and research customers of million  or 
geographically  european  canadian and pacific rim sales in increased million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  over  while sales to latin american customers decreased million  or 
international sales in decreased million versus sales in to european markets  reflecting our efforts to expand commercial market penetration  grew million  or  over  with sales in france  germany  the netherlands  the united kingdom and switzerland accounting for most of the increase 
negative foreign exchange rate effects on european sales in totaled million 
sales to asian markets in declined million  or  as compared with  with hong kong  korea  taiwan and the asean countries accounting for most of the decrease and sales into japan increasing million 
sales into canada and latin america grew million  or  over canada and latin america sales were also negatively impacted by a foreign exchange rate effect  which totaled million 
gross margin gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
our gross margin remained essentially unchanged for all three years 
a mix shift in sales towards our photonics product lines  which generally have higher margins  have been offset primarily by higher growth rates in sales to oem customers  which generally have lower margins  and lower sales and marketing page expenses 
we anticipate that these offsetting trends are likely to continue in future periods 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense sg a expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in the respective years 
our sg a expenses in increased million  or  versus  due in part to the inclusion of an additional month of expenses from the change in european reporting  which added million of expenses to  and to the inclusion of eosi for a full year in and the acquisition of npoc  which collectively added million of expenses in for which there were no comparable expenses in finally  higher international trade show activity and increased sales commissions also contributed to the increase in expenses versus sg a expenses in decreased by million  or versus  due primarily to decreased costs for incentive compensation programs  lower advertising expenses  reduced sales and marketing expenses in europe that resulted from changes made in to the european sales organization and to a favorable exchange rate effect in europe of million 
research and development r d expense r d expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
r d expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
our r d expenses in increased million  or  and our r d expenses in increased million  or  as compared with the increases in both years were attributable primarily to increased personnel costs related to the development of a number of new products and product enhancements including extending the range of our automated packaging and test equipment product lines for the fiber optic communications market  technology enhancements to the laserweld and autoalign packaging workstation  development of laser diode burn in and characterization systems and new products and software for our video metrology division 
we are committed to continued product development and expect that r d expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
interest expense our interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
although a majority of our debt is at fixed interest rates  we anticipate that interest expense for will decrease slightly from because our long term debt will be reduced by principal payments of million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
taxes based on income the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared with and compared with was primarily the result of improved profitability at our european operations resulting in the increased utilization of foreign tax loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by our operating activities in of million was primarily attributable to our operating income plus non cash items  principally depreciation and amortization  offset in part by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our customer receivables increased by million  or  in  while our sales grew by during the same period 
substantially all of this sales growth occurred in the fourth quarter of  thus resulting in a disproportionate increase in customer receivables relative to sales 
our inventories increased in over levels  due primarily to production planning associated with our goal of maintaining competitive manufacturing lead times  maintaining higher levels of certain inventory items in conjunction with our year preparation  and to the inclusion of inventory from npoc in for which there was no comparable inventory in we believe that we must maintain certain levels of inventory in order to ensure that the lead times to our customers remain competitive 
our accounts payable increased million  or  in compared with  primarily as a result of higher inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities in of million was attributable principally to our purchases of property  plant and equipment million  costs associated with our acquisitions of businesses page million  payments for an equity investment million and capitalization of software development costs million  partially offset by the net proceeds on the sale of an equity investment and other property million 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was attributable principally to an increase in the utilization of our line of credit and the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and purchase plans 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in long term borrowings and the repurchase of stock under our share repurchase program 
during  we repurchased  shares under our share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
at december   we had in place a million unsecured line of credit expiring october  and a million unsecured line of credit expiring october  both lines bear interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option  plus an unused line fee of per year 
at december   there was million outstanding under the million line of credit  with million available under the combined lines  after considering outstanding letters of credit 
we believe our current working capital position together with estimated cash flows from operations and existing credit availability are adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures  debt payment requirements  and continuation of the share repurchase program over at least the next year 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risks relating to our business  below  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
although we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies  we continue to evaluate acquisitions of products  technologies or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisitions 
impact of year in prior years  we have discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe that those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
our remediation efforts consisted primarily of upgrading the hardware and software of our primary enterprise systems and were accomplished as part of the normal course of upgrading our systems to support current and anticipated growth 
accordingly  the million cost of acquiring the upgraded computer hardware and software has been capitalized 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any residual year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
european economic and monetary union emu new european currency on january   member countries of the european economic and monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing national currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro page trades on currency exchanges and  during a three year dual currency transition period  either the euro or the national currencies may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and the national currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have implemented and are implementing plans to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  and the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  particularly once the euro currency is issued in while we anticipate that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that our key vendors  customers and distributors will not be affected by such euro currency issues  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
further  there can be no assurance that the currency market volatility will not increase  which could have an adverse effect on our euro exposures 
pending adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new standards for recording derivatives in interim and annual financial reports requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and therefore we will adopt the new requirements effective with the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
risks relating to our business our markets and industry are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new innovative products nor improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs  and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance and improve our existing products  to meet the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology  and be price competitive 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately achieve any one of these objectives  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we face significant and unpredictable risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
in  and  our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  with a substantial portion of this in europe 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total net sales for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of our operations are located in europe 
as a result of our international sales and presence  we face various risks  which include 
changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region where we manufacture or sell our products  
currency fluctuations  
a greater difficulty of administering our business globally  
difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  page 
compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements such as export requirements  tariffs  and other barriers  
longer accounts receivable cycles  
overlapping or differing tax structures  
differing protection of intellectual property  and 
trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
as a result of our international sales and operations  our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is particularly acute and could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations could increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
significant negative changes in exchange rates could significantly harm our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock would likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
the fluctuations are typically unpredictable  and are the result of numerous factors including 
the timing of customer orders within a given quarter  
fluctuations in economic conditions in the markets for our products  
our timing in introducing new products  
the demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  
changes in our pricing policies  or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  
market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  
the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  
the availability and cost of key components we require to manufacture and distribute our products  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
the timing of our competitors in introducing new products  
levels of expenses  and 
our manufacturing capacity 
page in addition  we may in the future choose to reduce prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by our competitors or as an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
this may also adversely affect our operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the results of previous quarters 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  are not meaningful and should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
given all of the factors that can affect quarterly revenue results  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors in any given future quarter  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
cyclical declines in the markets for our products could negatively affect our business 
we do business in several cyclical industries and we are susceptible to any downturns in each 
in particular  the semiconductor industry  where we do a substantial amount of our business  is particularly prone to abrupt downward turns  as was the case in and when the business cycle of one of these industries is in decline  the businesses of companies that supply products to that particular industry  such as our company  also generally experience a downturn since the demand for capital equipment to manufacture the products of that industry is also generally reduced 
other industries in which we do business can be seasonal in the demand for products 
if one or more of the industries in which we operate experiences a downturn  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we are highly dependent on the growth of the fiber optic communications industry and on our customers who serve this industry 
a substantial portion of our current and future business comes from sales to companies that manufacture components for fiber optic communications systems 
the fiber optics communications market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of this market  their products and components may not achieve or continue to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance with fiber optic systems vendors  it is likely that such customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in helping our customers develop products and manufacturing processes in advance of significant sales of our products to such customers 
a failure on the part of our customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the fiber optic communications market as a whole to grow  would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of our markets 
we market products for the fiber optic component  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial metrology  aerospace and research markets 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the product needs  required standards and technical challenges of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming  and if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
furthermore  our decision to continue to offer products for a given market or to enter new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that determine the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture and test their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance  which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
page if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate our employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  particularly for employees with expertise in fiber optics 
if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
any decline in our customers research budgets will negatively impact our operating results 
a significant amount of our revenues are derived from selling our products to research institutions in the united states and various foreign countries 
we anticipate that sales to such institutions will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
thus  our future performance is directly dependent in part upon the capital expenditure budgets of our research institution customers and the continued demand by such customers for our products 
domestic and foreign research institutions could experience constraints on their capital expenditure budgets due to factors such as reduced governmental funding of research activities  changes in research focus and reduced defense spending 
our operating results may be subject to fluctuations as a consequence of funding constraints 
if funding constraints are imposed and if they persist for an extended period of time  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we face substantial competition and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized market segments  against a limited number of companies 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop solutions on their own 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy higher name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources 
other competitors are relatively small and highly specialized firms  which enjoy the ability to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies  which could negatively affect our business 
we have historically achieved growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
as part of our strategy to sustain growth  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies  technologies and complementary product lines 
any acquisition would involve risks  including 
our ability to manufacture and sell the products of the businesses acquired  
a decline in demand by our customers for these acquired products  
our ability to integrate the acquired business operations  products and personnel  
our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  
our ability to expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and page procedures to incorporate the acquired businesses  
diversion of management s time and attention  
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the products or services of an acquired firm  and 
assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that any business that we may acquire will achieve anticipated revenues and operating results  which could decrease the value of the acquisition to us 
we rely on several sole source and limited source suppliers 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components are unavailable in adequate numbers or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our results of operations 
if any third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  we could face substantial licensing or litigation costs  or could be forced to stop selling some of our products 
our products are complex and include substantial technology 
it is possible that technology incorporated in our products  or the trademarks under which they are marketed  may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
third parties who believe that our products or trademarks infringe upon their intellectual property may assert such rights  which could result in litigation 
for example  we are currently engaged in litigation with a third party that claims that our use of the newport mark infringes their rights 
any litigation over intellectual property rights  whether with or without merit  would be time consuming  expensive and distracting to our management 
litigation could also subject us to extensive liabilities  including monetary damages and injunctions preventing us from selling certain of our products or from using one or more of our trademarks 
moreover  we could be forced to enter into licensing agreements or sell the rights to our products or technology on unfavorable terms  in order to avoid claims of infringement 
unfavorable outcomes regarding claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties could harm our business 
we must protect and enforce our intellectual property rights to remain competitive 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights such as patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and license agreements 
if we are unsuccessful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  our pending and future patent and trademark applications may be rejected  or our competitors may contest the scope or validity of our applications or existing rights  which could weaken our competitive position 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights or devise designs that circumvent our intellectual property  and we may not be able to detect this unauthorized use or effectively enforce our rights 
if any page third parties infringe our intellectual property rights  we could incur significant costs in defending our rights 
since we do business in foreign countries  we face the additional challenge of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights worldwide 
the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as those of the united states 
unauthorized use or misappropriation of our intellectual property  and our ability to remedy the misuse  could materially harm our business 
we are required to comply with government regulations  and we may incur significant expenses complying with these regulations 
many of our products are subject to government regulations on the federal  state and local levels  as well as to the government regulations of any of the foreign countries where we do business 
in addition  our products must comply with relevant industry standards  such as iso and nebs 
we are required to make substantial efforts to ensure compliance with these regulations and standards and to remedy any deficiencies 
if we fail to comply with all required government regulations  we could incur fines or be forced to curtail segments of our business 
in addition  many of our customers operate in regulated industries  which means that we must comply with any applicable regulations and standards within these industries 
our failure to comply with any of the regulations and standards will likely impair our ability to remain competitive and could harm our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to the rules and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to comply could result in a decline in our operating results 
we regularly enter into contracts with government agencies  or subcontracts with government contractors  which require us to abide by the special rules and regulations governing government contracts 
we may also be required to submit to investigations by government agencies to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations governing government contracts or with the provisions of any such government contracts 
if any governmental agency elected to investigate or review our practices with respect to government contracts  we would be required to cooperate with the investigation  which would likely result in significant distraction for management and other key employees 
if we fail to abide by the rules and regulations governing government contracts or to abide by the provisions of any government contracts  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our sales cycle is long and difficult to predict  which may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our products are complex  and customers for such products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  and require us to perform  elaborate testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
our sales cycle for such products typically varies and is difficult to predict  but can last as long as one year 
orders expected to be shipped in one quarter may slip to subsequent quarters  which would cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period  or cause us not to meet the expectations of investors or market analysts 
if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  or if our new products contain defects  our operating results will suffer 
because our products are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
our products may contain defects or undetected errors 
as a result we could incur substantial expenses in fixing any defects or undetected errors  which could result in damage to our competitive position and harm our results of operations and business 
we may incur expenses incident to complying with environmental regulations 
page there are aspects of our business that involve substances that could pose a threat of contamination to the environment 
although we believe we have complied with all environmental regulations and that we have implemented all necessary safeguards  we may in the future incur expenses from environmental remediation  or in connection with complying with current or future environmental regulations 
environmental remediation is costly  time consuming and could result in lengthy proceedings that could distract our management 
if we are required to remediate any environmental hazard  our business  results of operations and financial conditions could be harmed 
natural disasters could disrupt or shut down our operations 
our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constituted approximately of our consolidated operating profit 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our reported operating profit 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as we discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings for the last three years 
the impact of unrealized foreign exchange translation gains and losses is disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page page interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our unsecured lines of credit which bear interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
our long term debt instruments carry fixed interest rates 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our reported operating profit the sensitivity analyses presented in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
