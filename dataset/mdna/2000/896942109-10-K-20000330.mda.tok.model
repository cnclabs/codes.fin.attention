background tripath develops  manufactures and markets products to improve cervical cancer screening 
improved slide preparation technology is delivered through the autocyte prep system tm prep  a proprietary automated thin layer cytology sample preparation system that produces representative slides with a homogeneous  thin layer of cervical cells  and is one of only two sample preparation systems approved by the fda as a replacement for the conventional pap smear 
tripath also delivers visual intelligence technology to increase accuracy and productivity in medical testing through the autopap r primary screening system autopap  which utilizes proprietary technology to distinguish between normal pap smears and those that have the highest likelihood of abnormality 
in may  autopap was approved by the us food and drug administration as the first and only fully automated device for primary screening of pap smear slides 
on october   tripath announced submission of a supplement to the fda for the screening of prep slides by the autopap 
tripath generates prep revenue from the sale or rental of prep systems and the sale of the related test kits  comprised of proprietary reagents and other disposables 
for system sales  customers purchase the prep instrument and make separate purchases of test kits 
for system rentals  customers pay a fixed monthly fee for the equipment and make separate purchases of test kits 
the company also has an integrated purchase option ipo program where the prep instrument is placed at the customer s site free of charge  and the customer pays a higher per test price for the reagents and disposables 
each prep system placed typically provides a recurring revenue stream as the customers process the test kits sold by the company 
tripath generates autopap revenue from the sale of autopap systems or on a fee per use basis 
fee per use revenue commences in the month a system is initially placed in commercial use at a customer site and consists of per slide monthly billings  fixed rental billings  and minimum payments due on certain fee per use contracts 
the company s strategy is to maximize the number of instruments placed with customers and thereby increase its ongoing  higher margin reagent and fee per use revenue streams 
as an important element of this strategy  the company has entered into an agreement with a finance company to support the placement of prep rental and ipo systems and autopap fee per use systems 
tripath s future revenues and the results of operations may change significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend on many factors  including the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the timing and volume of system placements  regulatory and reimbursement matters  introduction of alternative technologies by competitors  pricing of competitive products  and the cost and effect of promotional discounts and marketing programs we adopt

the increase in fee per use revenues resulted from higher overall per slide pricing and increased placements during also contributing to the increase in revenues was a  increase in sales of prep units and related consumables and a million increase in pathology workstation revenues 
gross margin gross margin for was  a decrease from in this decrease was primarily attributable to discounts and incentives the company offered in autopap qc sale pricing in the first half of as customers anticipated fda approval of the autopap primary screener  as well as pricing incentives the company offered in the second half of the year as it signed initial orders for autopap primary screeners 
additionally  due to lower than optimal usage of certain autopap systems on fee per use contracts  the overall gross margin percentage on fee per use revenues was lower than the gross margin percentage on autopap systems sold
