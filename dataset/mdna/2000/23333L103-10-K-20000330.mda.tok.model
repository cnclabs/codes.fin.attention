see the discussion at the beginning of part i 
overview dtm develops  manufactures  and markets advanced rapid prototyping and manufacturing systems that include a sinterstation plus 
all sinterstation systems utilize a process called sls selective laser sintering and any of several plastic or metal sls materials to create three dimensional objects from cad designs 
leading manufacturers throughout the world  in a range of industries  use sinterstation systems to rapidly create production quality parts  functional prototypes  and tooling for their products 
sinterstation users can realize numerous benefits as they develop and manufacture products 
ability to efficiently produce low volume high value products or to even customize every product to the customer s exact needs  
time savings  
lower development costs  more efficient testing  
capability to prototype and test more design options  and 
the competitive advantage associated with bringing new products to market faster 
additionally  product designers can design complex part shapes that could not be fabricated under conventional methods 
unlike competing technologies and systems that are used primarily to create visualization models  dtm s systems address industry s growing need for rapidly produced  durable  testable prototypes and end use parts 
today  dtm s sinterstation systems are primarily used to create functional plastic prototypes 
we believe that sls selective laser sintering is currently the leading rapid prototyping technology in the world for the functional plastic prototype application 
in  dtm licensed metal sintering powder technology developed by rockwell science center  a key customer 
dtm intends to begin to introduce a range of metal sintering materials in late we believe that the metals based functional prototype market could ultimately be as large for dtm as its current plastics based functional prototype market 
a significant and growing use of sinterstation systems is for manufacturing low volume high value parts either directly in the sinterstation or in conjunction with traditional casting and molding processes 
an expanding base of selective laser sintering capacity the ultimate users of sinterstation capacity are  primarily  manufacturing companies either directly owned or contracted through service providers 
in  of sinterstation sales were directly to manufacturing companies and they now represent of cumulative system sales 
the other system sales have been to the service providers and  to a lesser extent  to universities for research and education 
approximately  and of the systems sold in  and  respectively  were to new customer sites 
approximately of our customer sites now have multiple dtm sinterstation systems in operation 
by the end of  cumulative sales of dtm sinterstation systems reached systems at customer sites located in manufacturing centers worldwide 
one rapid prototyping service bureau deploys six sinterstation systems at one site 
one of the world s largest aircraft manufacturers deploys nine sinterstation systems in total at multiple facilities and plants 
many of the world s automobile manufacturers deploy from one to six sinterstation systems each in total at their design centers and plants 
machine and accessories revenues revenues derived from machines and accessories were million in  an increase of from  which represented a decline of from such revenues have not kept pace with unit growth due to decreased prices and the decline in the sale of accessories 
in  dtm shipped a record sinterstation systems  including used and demonstration units 
this represents a total unit increase of compared to the number of units shipped in  which represented a increase over the number of units shipped in production units comprised  and of these totals in  and  respectively 
machine and accessories revenues per unit sold  both production and previously owned  averaged approximately   and  in  and  respectively  which do not include sintering powders or services included in the system packages 
the company has experienced a trend toward lower pricing on its production units  of approximately per year  as it has attempted to broaden its customer base 
the company offers turnkey solutions  which include  in addition to the sinterstation system  third party accessories  such as furnaces and material handling equipment 
however  there has been a trend for customers to order the accessories directly from the manufacturers 
additionally  the quantity of accessories included with a system is dependent on whether the order is an addition to an existing customer site or a new site in need of the full compliment of accessory equipment 
volume pricing is available with multiple machine orders and the company anticipates that multiple machine orders could become significant as the company targets more manufacturing oriented applications 
in the coming year  the company anticipates a further price decrease in the average machine and accessories revenue per sale 
machine and accessories cost of goods sold per unit  both production and previously owned  averaged approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
from to  the average cost was positively impacted by the august introduction of the sinterstation plus and  to a lesser extent  fewer sales of accessories and by the inventory write down 
the company continues to focus on reducing the average cost of its machines and accessories and believes that further reductions are possible in the coming year that might offset the anticipated decease in sales prices 
with these costs the average gross margins on machines and accessories were  and in  and  respectively 
continuing business the continuing business revenues are becoming more significant to the company 
the percentage of revenues derived from sales of powdered sintering materials and services represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
by the end of  the installed base of sinterstation systems had grown to systems in the field 
the average for was  an increase of from  which represented a increase from the market for powdered sintering materials and services is the installed base of sinterstation systems 
we calculate dtm s installed base to be the cumulative number of sinterstation sales less trade ins and other re acquired systems 
sales and service records indicate that substantially all of these machines are still in use 
over of the installed base of units has been in the field less than five years 
revenues derived from the sale of sintering materials were million in  an increase of from  which was represented a increase from sintering materials revenues averaged  over the average installed base in  which represented a increase from the average in  which represented a increase from the average in duraform was introduced in as a premium high performance material  which  due to its enhanced recycling properties  requires lower quantities to operate than the previous products 
duraform and the nylon products that it completely replaced in accounted for over of materials shipments in each year in the three years ended december  as the changeover to the duraform products was virtually complete in early  growth in revenues in the coming year from sintering materials should tend to follow the growth in the average installed base and for this reason average sintering materials per unit in the field may be more constant 
revenues derived from services were million in  an increase of from  which was a increase from services and support revenues averaged  over the average installed base in  which represented a decrease for the average amount for  which represented a decrease from the average amount in in late  the company entered into an arrangement with one of its sales representatives in a pacific rim country to share responsibility and revenues for front line support in that country 
the company may make other such arrangements 
future growth in the company s services and support revenues may continue to trail the growth in the installed base and  correspondingly  average service and support revenues for dtm may continue to decline 
revenue recognition policies summary the company recognizes revenue only when finished products are shipped  title and risks of ownership have transferred to the buyer  the company s remaining obligations are insignificant and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the company recognizes service and support revenues when performed or in the case of service contracts over the contract period 
deferred revenue equal to the estimated cost of warranty is recorded on each system sale and recognized as service and support revenue over the warranty period

revenues increased to million in as compared to an increase of to million in and an increase of to million in the increases in and were primarily due to increased unit volumes in each year and the introduction of a premium material in late machine and accessories revenues realized per unit sold were lowered from the previous year in and continuing revenues  powdered sintering materials and services derived from the installed base  grew faster than the growth in the installed base in and the company s international revenues were million  or  of total revenues  compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
germany and japan were the only foreign countries from which more than of the company s revenues were derived 
revenues derived from german customers amounted to  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues derived from japanese customers amounted to of total revenues in and were less than in and except for sales occurring in germany  japan and the united kingdom  the company s international revenues were primarily denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
beginning in  sales are offered throughout the european economic union countries in euros instead of u 
s 
dollars 
the company does not hedge all of its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on exchange transactions and translation of foreign operations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in any period 
however  in  and dtm did experience downward pressure on its international prices as the us dollar strengthened significantly against most european and asian currencies 
if this strengthening continues  the company expects continued downward pressure on the company s sales prices in the international markets 
revenues in past periods may not be indicative of revenues in the future  which may be affected by other business environment and risk factors previously discussed  as well as other factors included elsewhere herein 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or  of revenue  in  compared to million  or of revenues in  and million  or of revenues in the gross profit increases in and were due to sequentially higher worldwide unit volume each year 
the introduction of a cost reduced platform in late and a premium material in late affected the and gross margins positively 
the gross margin was affected negatively by an inventory write down of  in the second quarter of caused by product obsolescence 
the company believes there is a risk that gross margin percentages may decline in the face of the strong us dollar 
other factors  including pricing pressures internationally and changes in material and labor costs  may also have an adverse effect on gross margins 
past gross margins are not necessarily indicative of future gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense was million or of revenues in  compared to million or of revenues and million or of revenues in and  respectively 
the increased spending in both and in was primarily related to the increased costs associated with sales and sales support staffs and commission expense resulting from higher sales levels 
the decreases in percentage of revenues spent was primarily attributable to cost containment programs and to more efficient utilization of the overhead infrastructure 
selling  general and administrative expense may vary as a percentage of revenues in the future 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased by to million in  from million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher expense levels were  primarily  due to outsourcing costs associated with the initial design and prototype cost associated with multiple significant new product development projects that commenced in and culminated in with the introduction of several new material systems and the new sinterstation model plus 
also  over this period the company has increasingly relied on external partnerships to develop it s powdered sintering materials and has realized efficiencies with this approach 
in  the company plans to focus on specific development initiatives directed at manufacturing applications and direct metal parts 
the company plans to increase its spending on research and development in to approximately million 
this planned  increase in spending is primarily related to increased outsourcing costs and to one time prototype costs 
should the planned increase in revenues not support the planned increase in research and development planned at a level below of revenues  attempts will be made to delay the planned investments 
research and development expense may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and such expenditures may vary as a percentage of sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors 
provision for litigation settlement 
in  dtm settled the shareholder class action lawsuit pending against it 
the charge to its second quarter statement of operations in the amount of million consisted of million  the value of the settlement  and  in other costs  net of the insurance recovery of million 
stock compensation eap 
in connection with the ipo  the company incurred a one time non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million as a result of previously outstanding stock appreciation rights converting by formula into immediately vested stock options at exercise prices below the market value of the common stock 
this charge was recorded in the second quarter of interest expense 
net interest expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase from to reflects the need to finance growth 
the decrease in interest expense from to resulted from the repayment of substantially all outstanding indebtedness in may from the proceeds of the ipo 
gain on sale of assets 
in the first quarter of and the fourth and third quarters of the company sold used sinterstation model and model systems under an announced program to sell systems that had been used internally for development and support activities or under a discontinued rental program 
the company recognized a net gain of  and  on those sales in and  respectively 
income taxes 
in  the company provided for income taxes at a effective rate 
as a result of the february change in control of dtm  utilization of net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to additional annual limits of approximately  in  as a result of its tax sharing arrangement with bfgoodrich  its then controlling shareholder  the company was allocated an income tax benefit of  in may  bfgoodrich s ownership interest fell below and such benefits were no longer available to the company 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded the final accounting for this tax allocation arrangement 
at december   dtm had approximately million of federal net operating loss carry forwards 
these net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in dtm has not recognized any benefit from the future use of loss carry forwards for these periods due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based upon the taxable earnings history 
net income loss 
the company had net income of million in the million improvement from to was primarily due to increased product and service revenues  improved gross margins on a cost reduced platform and powdered sintering materials  reduced spending on research and development and control of other operating expenses 
the company had net losses  excluding special charges  of million and million in and  respectively 
the million improvement from to was primarily due to increased product and service revenues  improved gross margins on sinterstation systems  reduced research and development expense  reduced interest expense and gains from the sale of internally used sinterstation systems 
operating results for included a special charge of million for the estimated cost of settling the shareholder class action litigation and  of an inventory write off relating to new product introductions 
the operating results for were adversely affected by a special charge of million arising from the conversion of stock appreciation rights by dtm employees in connection with the company s ipo in may additionally  operating results for were benefited from  of tax credits allocated from the company s parent at that time

the company s investing activities include expenditures for patents and licenses  capitalized software costs and furniture and equipment  principally consisting of the company s sinterstation systems built for internal use and  prior to  for rental purposes 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
proceeds from sales of capital equipment  principally demonstration systems  were  in and million in for  the company has planned for approximately million in capital expenditures 
this includes additions to internally used demonstration systems to replace units coming off operating leases in and expansion of our demonstration part capacity to support growth 
the company intends to fund this additional investment from operations 
dtm has a million credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the terms of this credit facility are interest at prime plus per annum on the outstanding loan balance and the application of all customer remittances against any outstanding loans 
the corporate assets of dtm collateralize this agreement 
at december   the borrowing base exceeded the loan limit of million and there was no outstanding loan balance 
in the second quarter of  dtm repaid a liability of approximately  to dtm acquisition company  lp  which had been acquired from bfgoodrich 
dtm satisfied this liability by making a payment of  in cash borrowed under the new credit facility with silicon valley bank and by issuing  additional shares of dtm common stock 
the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet business requirements  including capital expenditures  working capital requirements  the debt obligations outstanding and operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment through december  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of inflation the company s business operations are subject to inflationary pressures 
due to the competitive environment in this industry  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase prices in the event of increased labor and material costs 
new accounting standard in june  the accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company plans to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement requires all derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
however  the statement could increase volatility in earnings and comprehensive income 
year computer problem prior to january   there was a great deal of concern regarding the ability of computers to adequately recognize st century dates from th century dates due to the two digit date fields used by many systems 
most reports to date  however  are that computer systems are functioning normally and the compliance and remediation work accomplished leading up to was effective to prevent any problems 
computer experts have warned that there may still be residual consequences of the change in centuries and any such difficulties could result in a decrease in sales of our products  an increase in allocation of resources to address year problems of our customers without additional revenue commensurate with such dedication of resources  or an increase in litigation costs relating to losses suffered by our customers due to such year problems 
introduction of the euro the company s financial systems have been converted to full euro readiness 
the company is able to denominate agreements and hedges in euros as necessary 
additionally  the company has recently introduced euro pricing in each of the european economic monetary union countries where the common currency will become the official currency in risk factors that may affect future results and safe harbor statement emerging rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing markets the market for rapid prototyping products and services  such as those marketed by the company  remains in an early stage of development and includes multiple  competing technologies  many of which are not yet fully developed 
participants in this market are moving to address new applications  many of which may not yet be known or accepted by potential users 
rapid prototyping requires that a three dimensional cad file describe a design and organizations who are not currently using three dimensional cad are not  generally  potential customers for rapid prototyping products and services 
significant education of the end user in both three dimensional cad modeling and rapid prototyping in general has in some cases been a prerequisite to product acceptance 
it is not clear at this time which one or more technologies will gain broad market acceptance 
the markets for rapid manufacturing products and rapid tooling products  such as those marketed by the company  are in an even earlier stage of development than rapid prototyping 
participants in these markets  including the company  are moving to address new applications  many of which may not yet be known or accepted by potential users 
the companies who use traditional casting methods for metal parts and traditional machining methods to make injection molding tooling have made large capital investments in traditional equipment and have mature infrastructures for doing so 
they may be highly resistant both on financial and cultural bases to adopting new technologies 
there can be no assurance that rapid manufacturing technologies and rapid tooling technologies will evolve to the point that the perceived value will overcome those obstacles 
competition the market for rapid prototyping systems is competitive 
in marketing its sinterstation systems  the company experiences competition from many sources 
certain of the company s competitors are better known and have greater financial  research and development  production and marketing resources than dtm 
the design and manufacturing applications that the company s products address applications are currently primarily accomplished using machining  milling and grinding equipment 
the suppliers of such traditional equipment are large and numerous 
large amounts of capital have already been expended on such traditional equipment and there exists a cultural bias to its use in many manufacturing organizations 
the principal worldwide competitors in rapid prototyping are d systems corporation and stratasys  inc eos gmbh electro optical systems is an additional significant competitor outside of north america 
competition has increased as a result of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by these competitors and the entry into the industry by other companies 
increased competition has in the past resulted  and may in the future continue to result  in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which have materially adversely affected the company s business and financial results 
the company believes that it may eventually face competition in the supply of powdered sintering materials and services to sinterstation users and that this competition will likely be based upon suitability and upon price 
the company already experiences competition for technical services to its installed base as many of its customers have technical skills and resources to effectively support the equipment without factory assistance 
the company may also face external competition for such technical services from other service organizations and such competition for services will likely be based upon suitability and price 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results in prior years  the company s revenues and operating results have varied at times substantially from quarter to quarter and may continue to do so 
dtm typically experiences a relatively long lead time  often from six to months  to complete a sinterstation system sale 
the company s combined procurement and manufacturing cycle is currently three months 
furthermore  new product introductions  seasonality of customer buying patterns and other factors can cause fluctuations in quarterly results 
in prior years  these fluctuations have precluded  and may preclude again  the company from managing its inventories effectively from quarter to quarter 
the failure of the company to complete a particular sinterstation system sale in any given quarter can have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance for that quarter and quarterly fluctuations could cause a material adverse effect on the price at which the company s common stock trades 
the tendency for a large number of the company s sales made during a quarter to be completed at or near the end of the quarter also hinders the company s ability to predict sales  control sales prices and enforce its standard terms 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing  possibility of significant dilution the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including its profitability  growth rate  working capital requirements  expenses associated with protection of its patents and other intellectual property  and costs of future research and development activities 
the company currently plans to fund its self through operations 
future operating results will depend  in part  on the company s ability to obtain and manage capital sufficient to finance its business 
to the extent that funds expected to be generated from the company s operations are not sufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will seek to obtain additional funds through bank credit facilities  equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and others from other sources 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay or to eliminate certain expenditures or to license to third parties the rights to commercialize technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
in addition  in the event that the company obtains any additional funding  such financing may have a substantially dilutive effect on the holders of the company s securities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
limited product company the company currently offers one model of sinterstation systems for sale 
the sale of sinterstation systems comprised the majority of annual revenues for the company 
the company s sinterstation systems are priced in excess of  and a new purchaser must also consider the on going operating expense commitment associated with the acquisition of such a system 
in a downturn or a soft market  the company s dependence upon a limited range of products  as opposed to a wide range of products at different price points  has caused the company s financial performance to be adversely affected and may do so again 
intellectual property and proprietary rights in pursuing protection for its proprietary rights in its sinterstation systems  materials and related technology  the company currently relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  as well as contractual provisions 
the company aggressively seeks patent protection for its selective laser sintering technology 
however  patent protection may not always be available 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued under any or all of the patent applications to which the company has rights 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company is currently involved in significant litigation with eos gmbh electro optical systems in germany  france  italy and japan  with regard to the company s proprietary rights 
if dtm is unsuccessful in their litigation  its competitive position may be further harmed in those countries 
in addition  the company can give no assurance that the issued patents to which it holds rights will be adequate to protect its interests or  if challenged  held valid 
the company s competitors could develop non infringing systems  materials or technologies that are equivalent or superior to those of the company 
a european competitor  eos  currently does and others also may practice technology believed by dtm to be covered by dtm s patents or other legal or contractual protections regardless of the fact that it may be legally protected 
any litigation to enforce the company s intellectual property rights would be expensive and time consuming or adequate to protect the company s business 
while dtm defends its intellectual property vigorously  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in its various litigation in many countries 
if the company were unsuccessful in enforcing its intellectual property rights or other contractual rights in the context of third party offers to sell selective laser sintering systems or sintering powders or if the company were found to have violated state or federal antitrust laws  the company s future revenues might be adversely affected 
furthermore  unrelated third parties hold many patents and pending patent applications under which the company is not a licensee that relate to the design and manufacture of rapid prototyping systems and materials 
if such a third party brought infringement litigation against the company  and if the company was not successful in defending such litigation or in obtaining a license  the company s business and financial performance could be materially adversely affected 
the company has been threatened with such litigation by a european competitor  eos  and the company has filed suit against eos seeking a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe any valid claims of the patents being asserted 
the university of texas system licenses certain key intellectual property used in the selective laser sintering process to the company 
as a licensee  the company s rights to practice the technology are not absolute 
the university of texas could terminate  attempt to terminate or amend the license if the company could be shown to be in material default of the terms of the license 
even if dtm has a basis for objection  defense of its rights as a licensee could be costly and the outcome would be uncertain 
loss of significant rights as a licensee under this license could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a substantial extent on a relatively few key management employees 
losing the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
the company s success also depends on its ability to continue to attract highly talented technical personnel 
candidates with appropriate training and expertise may be in short supply in the geographic areas where the company is attempting to recruit personnel 
the company has put in place incentive compensation plans intended to provide motivation for continued employment of key employees 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to retain employees or continue to attract  assimilate and retain other skilled personnel 
dependence on third party suppliers the company subcontracts for manufacture of sinterstation system components  powdered sintering materials and accessories from single source  third party suppliers 
a disruption in supply or failure of a supplier to remain competitive in functionality or price could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales or reputation for timely delivery  and  hence  on the company s business  financial performance and results of operations 
during  customer demand for duraform  the company s most popular powdered sintering materials  came close to exceeding the supply 
the company has worked with its supplier to modify the suppliers manufacturing process to increase the amounts available to dtm s customers for however demand may increase again to use up the increased supply 
international operations revenues from customers located outside the us represented the majority of the company s total revenues in the recent three years 
the company believes that continued growth and profitability would require expansion of its sales in international markets 
this expansion may be costly and time consuming and may not generate returns for a significant period of time  if at all 
fluctuations in exchange rates as well as interest rates have significantly affected dtm s sales in foreign markets 
in particular  a strengthening us dollar has adversely affected the price competitiveness against a foreign competitor of dtm s products and services in the international markets 
a significant and increasing portion of international sales are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby exposing the company to gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging activity by the company to limit currency exchange risk will be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
nor can there be assurance that the company s exposure to risks associated with international operations will not continue to have a material adverse effect on its liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
the regulatory environment  including import export laws  protective trade policies and currency controls of foreign governments  also could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
control of the company proactive currently controls approximately of the outstanding common stock 
at this percentage  proactive could control elections of the company s board of directors and could control or substantially affect the outcome of most matters submitted to the company s shareholders for their vote or consent 
proactive could also cause  prevent or delay a change in control of the company 
product liability products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite testing by the company  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers  which could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to the company s reputation and business 
the company attempts to include provisions in its agreements with customers that are designed to limit the company s exposure to potential liability for damages arising out of defects or errors in the company s products 
however  the nature and extent of such limitations vary from customer to customer and it is possible that such limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of the company s products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any such claim brought against the company  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to the company  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to the company s business reputation and its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
shares eligible for future sale sales of shares of common stock into the market by proactive or employees exercising options could cause a decline in the price of such stock 
of the shares of the common stock owned by proactive  approximately  are tradable  subject to the resale limitations of rule  as promulgated by the us securities and exchange commission that are applicable to an affiliate of the company 
in addition  the company has granted proactive certain demand registration rights and if the company proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act of  whether for its own account  for the account of other shareholders or for both  proactive is entitled to notice of such registration and is entitled to include its shares of the company s common stock in the registration 
dtm employees hold immediately exercisable options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the company registered the issuance and the sale of the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise of options under the stock option plans on a form s registration statements 
as a result  the common stock acquired by employees of dtm upon exercise of options outstanding under the stock option plans will be freely tradable subject to compliance with certain provisions of rule  in the case of affiliates of the company 
market volatility the company s common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap stock market 
historically  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market price of common stock of technology related companies 
that volatility sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies
