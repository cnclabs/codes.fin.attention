the balanced budget act of the budget act enacted sweeping changes in reimbursement methodology for skilled nursing facilities 
beginning july   skilled nursing providers with year ends of june  were reimbursed under a fixed payment methodology based upon the patient s level of care as opposed to a cost based methodology 
the new methodology assigns patients into resource utilization groupings rug that have corresponding fixed per diem rates 
the new methodology has a three year phase in program whereby providers will receive a blending of historical facility specific cost and national average rates 
the facility specific costs are based on audited cost reports 
the national average rates are the health care financing administration s hcfa s compilation of all skilled nursing cost reports with adjustments made to reduce or eliminate certain data
