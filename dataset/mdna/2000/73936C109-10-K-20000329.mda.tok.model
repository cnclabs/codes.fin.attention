item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide pcs services in the southeastern united states under the name powertel 
our pcs licenses encompass a territory of approximately  contiguous square miles with a population of approximately million people 
we hold licenses to serve the atlanta  georgia mta  the jacksonville  florida mta  the memphis  tennessee jackson  mississippi mta and the birmingham  alabama mta and btas in kentucky and tennessee 
we hold mhz of spectrum licensed for pcs in the mta markets  and we hold mhz of spectrum licensed for pcs in all of the bta markets except for the knoxville  tennessee bta  where we hold a license for mhz of spectrum 
we have one of the largest contiguous licensed pcs footprints in the southeastern united states 
we introduced our pcs services in october in jacksonville  florida and montgomery  alabama and  to date  have launched our pcs services in a total of markets in the southeast 
as of december   we had approximately  postpaid pcs subscribers and  prepaid pcs subscribers 
on april   we sold substantially all of our cellular telephone assets to public service cellular  inc for million 
prior to that sale  we provided cellular telephone service in contiguous portions of eastern alabama and western georgia under the name intercel 
on june   we sold of our towers  related assets and liabilities to a subsidiary of crown castle international corp 
for million in cash 
in connection with this sale  we agreed to lease space on these towers for a monthly rent of  per tower for an initial lease term of ten years  with three five year renewal periods that we may exercise at our option 
on september   we also entered into a build to suit construction contract with crown castle that grants crown castle a right of first refusal to build  acquire and lease back to us at a rent of  per month up to tower sites to be constructed prior to december  on december   we sold an additional towers to crown castle under substantially similar terms as the june sale for million in cash 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the significant costs required to maintain our expanding pcs network  the hiring and management of required personnel to operate our business and market our services  the subsidization of handsets to our subscribers and the depreciation of pcs equipment and amortization of the pcs licenses 
we expect to continue incurring operating losses beyond as we continue to expand and enhance our pcs network  increase our subscriber base and subsidize the cost of handsets to our subscribers 
until recently  average revenues per subscriber in the wireless industry have declined  which we believe is the result of the addition of new subscribers on lower priced rate plans  as well as intensified competition within the wireless industry 
we believe the effects of these trends on our earnings will be mitigated by a corresponding increase in the number of wireless subscribers who desire additional value added services primarily in the data area and our continued focus on offering products and services designed to encourage our subscribers to purchase higher priced rate plans 
minimizing subscriber attrition  or churn  remains a challenge as our subscriber base grows and competition intensifies 
we generated an average monthly churn rate of and for our postpaid and prepaid pcs subscriber base  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to for our postpaid pcs subscriber base for because we did not launch prepaid service until september  we did not report prepaid pcs churn during we believe the continued improvement in our postpaid pcs churn rate is the result of stricter credit evaluation policies  improved customer service response and training  our centralized call center  focused collections efforts and the availability of our prepaid service alternative 
we are a member of the gsm alliance  a consortium of pcs carriers who offer gsm based pcs service throughout north america 
all members of the gsm alliance have executed roaming agreements with each other  which allow gsm subscribers to roam throughout many major metropolitan areas in the us and canada

pcs cost of services increased million  or  for as compared to this increase is the result of the additional cell sites we placed in service in  as well as increased interconnection and toll costs related to increased traffic on our expanding pcs network and increased commissions due to the significant volume of prepaid card renewals 
we generated a negative pcs equipment margin of on million of sales during as compared to a negative on million of sales for the improvement in margins reflects a continued decrease in the average cost of handsets because of changes in the handset mix and our efforts to limit the subsidization of handset upgrades for existing subscribers

costs associated with the initial pcs system buildout  which we have completed  included tower sites  leasehold improvements  base station and switch equipment and labor expenses related to construction of sites 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures will total approximately million for these expenditures are primarily to enhance and expand our pcs network in existing markets in order to increase capacity and to satisfy subscriber needs and competitive requirements  as well as to build out certain secondary cities within our licensed footprint 
we will continue to upgrade our network capacity and service quality  particularly as they relate to our prepaid service intelligent network platform  to support our anticipated subscriber growth 
although we have completed the initial buildout of our pcs system  we continue to require significant amounts of capital to fund the operation and expansion of our pcs business 
we believe cash on hand and cash from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our pcs operations in we are unable to predict the amount of expenditures that we will make beyond  and we may need to raise additional capital to fund and expand our business operations

if we fail to obtain additional financing  we could experience delays in some or all of our expansion plans and expenditures  which could limit our ability to meet our debt service obligations and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the future while we continue to expand our pcs system and build our subscriber base 
our ability to satisfy our debt repayment obligations and covenants depends upon our future performance  which is subject to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
cash interest will not be payable on our senior discount notes prior to we cannot guarantee that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities to meet our debt service and working capital requirements  and we may need to refinance our indebtedness 
however  our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  the state of the public and private debt and equity markets  the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
in addition  if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service requirements or if we fail to comply with the covenants governing our indebtedness  we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness 
we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms that are either acceptable or favorable to our stockholders or us
