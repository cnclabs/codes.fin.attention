disclosures regarding year community trust bancorp  inc s project to address year readiness  which relates to the recognition of dates beyond  has been successful to date 
the project was to address the problem related to software programs and hardware systems that addressed dates in a two digit format  which would not properly process beyond the year the costs associated with the year project were  in and  in community trust bancorp  inc utilized internal staff for the management and implementation of its year compliance program  as a result it did not incur any material costs with outside contractors 
subsequently  it did not incur a material increase in operating costs 
liquidity the corporation s objectives are to ensure that funds are available at the subsidiary bank and thrift to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability  and to ensure that funding is available for the parent corporation to meet its ongoing cash needs while maximizing profitability 
the corporation continues to identify ways to provide for liquidity on both a current and long term basis 
on a long term basis  the subsidiary bank and thrift rely mainly on core deposits  certificates of deposit of  or more  repayment of principal and interest on loans and securities  as well as federal funds sold and purchased 
the subsidiary bank and thrift also rely on the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  securities available for sale and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposits decreased marginally from billion at december  to billion at december  in order to fund new loan growth in the second half of and to compensate for the loss of deposit funding  the company decreased its federal funds sold position by million in the lack of deposit funding has not affected the company s ability to fund loans or service its debt obligations 
due to the nature of the markets served by the banking regions  management believes that the majority of its certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during the periods of low interest rates  these deposit balances remained stable as a percentage of total deposits 
in addition  the corporation is able to borrow funds with several correspondent banks  to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
the corporation owns million of securities designated as available for sale and valued at market which are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances decreased from million at december  to million at december  the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the corporation has million of a million credit line available beyond  in the form of a revolving line of credit see note long term debt 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of investment securities and loan originations 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management monitors the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
the corporation monitors its interest rate risk by the use of static and dynamic gap models at the one year interval 
the static gap model monitors the difference in interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of total assets that mature within the specified time frame 
the dynamic gap model goes further in that it assumes that interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be reinvested 
the corporation uses the sendero system to monitor its interest rate risk 
the corporation desires an interest sensitivity gap of not more than fifteen percent of total assets at the one year interval 
the company s static interest rate gap position as of december  is presented below interest rate sensitivity analysis december  total over in thousands months months year year total interest earning assets securities and deposits      loans less nonaccrual      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings accounts      time deposits      federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings      advances from fhlb     long term debt     total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap for the period      cumulative      cumulative as a percent of earning assets capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the primary source of capital of the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were  and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations
