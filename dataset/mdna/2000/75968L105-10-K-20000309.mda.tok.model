item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans  information included or incorporated by reference in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by  or on behalf of  the company including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans 
the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on single product line and significant distributor 
the company s accelerated reader software and supplemental accelerated reader quiz disks accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
sales of the company s products through one book distributor accounted for  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader  supplemental quiz disks  star reading and related products  including sales through book distributors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on continued product development 
the k educational technology and professional development markets in which the company competes are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions and  to a lesser extent  sudden technological change 
the company s future success will depend  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including the company s ability to enhance its existing products and develop and successfully introduce new products  including new products designed for use in other areas of the curriculum  the company s ability to ship new products in a timely fashion and the company s ability to respond quickly and in a cost efficient manner to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  languages  alternative delivery systems and other environments 
there can be no assurance that products designed for use in other areas of the curriculum besides reading will be as well received as the company s reading products  particularly since such other products may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
the company attempts to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of its products 
the company s adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete or that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain its competitive position 
management of growth 
the company has experienced rapid growth 
if such growth continues  it may place a strain on the company s financial  management  systems and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees and to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
if the company is unable to maintain and manage growth effectively  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
risks of new products and services for new markets 
the company s business strategy includes the introduction of new products and services directed at new markets 
specifically  through its generation learning systems subsidiary  the company intends to sell enterprise software for training development and management to businesses and government organizations 
the company has historically focused on the education market and has little  if any  experience in developing and marketing products and services to business or government customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in offering new products and services and entering new markets as planned or that any such products or services  if introduced  will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
risks of international expansion 
a key component of the company s growth strategy is to continue to expand its operations into international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of the company s approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of these risks were to materialize  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
opposing educational philosophies 
the company focuses on developing and marketing educational products and services that demonstrate effectiveness through measurable results 
this approach  however  is not accepted by all academics and educators  some of whom formulate opinions about the desirability of a particular educational product or service based on philosophical or other concerns rather than the effectiveness of the product 
certain academics and educators are opposed to the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with the company s products  such as the use of objective standards  standardized testing  computers and motivational techniques  among others 
some of these philosophical opponents of the company s products and services have the capacity to influence the market for the company s products  and such influence could have a material adverse impact on demand for the company s products and  thus  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of the company s revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators and suppliers thereto 
there can be no assurance that educational institutions and or individual educators will continue to invest in technology based products and professional development for reading and other curricula or continue to respond favorably to the company s marketing 
the inability of the company to increase the number of products sold or number of schools served would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the company s dependence on educational institutions  the funding of which is largely dependent on government support  a substantial decrease in government budgets or funding for educational software or technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  certain aspects of government sponsored education initiatives may not endorse  or be complementary to  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with the company s products  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of the company s sales is concentrated in several states  including texas  california  florida  georgia and illinois  which accounted for approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively  of the company s net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing the company s products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive industry 
the k educational technology and professional development markets in which the company operates are very competitive 
the company competes primarily against more traditional methods of education  training and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
in addition  the company competes with other companies offering educational software products to schools  including larger companies with greater resources than the company  such as international business machines corporation  apple computer  inc and mattel inc 
the company s reading products also compete more directly with products such as scholastic s reading counts formerly electronic bookshelf 
many other companies  including microsoft corp 
and walt disney co  provide educational software products which the company believes are not marketed primarily to schools 
the company s existing competitors may continue to broaden their product lines  and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers and educational publishers  may enter or increase their focus on the school market  resulting in greater competition for the company 
success in selling the company s products  particularly its reading products  may cause competitors to focus on the company s products in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to market its products successfully or compete effectively in the educational products marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management  including judith paul and terrance paul  the chairman and vice chairman of the company  respectively 
in addition to serving as chairman of the company  ms 
paul is a spokesperson for the company and coordinates the company s public relations and customer communications policies 
mr 
paul is primarily responsible for the company s long term strategic planning and new product development strategy 
the company does not have employment agreements with either of these persons and has no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of services of either of these persons would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of the company s products and to attract and retain qualified additional employees trained in computer technology  marketing and finance to enhance the company s product offerings and broaden its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
the company generally ships products as orders are received  and therefore  has historically operated without significant backlog 
thus  revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the quantity of product orders received in that quarter 
the quantity of product orders in any quarter can be affected by a variety of factors  including the following delays in the development and or shipment of new products can adversely affect the company s revenue in one or more quarters  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for some period of time can cause the revenues in the quarter in which shipment occurs to be higher than revenues in preceding or subsequent quarters  and seasonal variations due to  among other things  the budget and school year cycles of the company s school customers 
in addition to fluctuations in product orders  the company s quarterly results can also be affected by the following charges related to acquisitions  including acquisition expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of goodwill  and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired assets  and expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives 
the company s overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of product sales and service sales 
the company realizes significantly higher margins on its product sales 
service revenues tend to be more seasonal than product revenues  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
quarterly service revenues are typically highest in the third quarter 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations and or new products by the company and its competitors  earnings releases and earnings warnings by the company and its competitors  market conditions in the industry and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of its common stock may decline significantly if the company fails to meet the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of the company s results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of its common stock 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company regards certain of its technologies as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation 
in addition  while the company does not believe that its products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such an assertion may be material  whether or not the assertion is validated 
the software market has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s software products will not experience unauthorized reproduction  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of march   the principal shareholders of the company  judith paul and terrance paul  who are also the chairman and vice chairman of the company  respectively  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  such principal shareholders have the ability to control the company and direct its business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for the common stock 
approximately  shares are held by affiliates of the company and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  the company has filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the company s stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the company s employee stock purchase plan  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
no payment of cash dividends 
the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by law provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions could result in the company being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt 
item properties the company s corporate headquarters are located in wisconsin rapids  wisconsin  in a  square foot facility owned by the company

the company s learning information systems consist of computer software and related training designed to improve student academic performance by increasing the quality  quantity  and timeliness of performance data available to educators and by facilitating increased student practice of essential skills 
the company s flagship product  accelerated reader  is software for motivating and monitoring increased literature based reading practice 
the company s software products also include star reading  a computer adaptive reading test and database  accelerated math and star math  software products that apply to math the principles that have made the reading software effective in improving academic performance  and perfect copy  writing skills development software 
in  the company began shipment of new  improved versions of its accelerated reader and star reading software products 
the company s learning information system products also include the reading renaissance  math renaissance and effective teaching programs  through which the company provides professional development training for educators 
in  the company introduced school renaissance  a comprehensive package of software  professional development training  and consulting services aimed at accelerating learning and improving test scores in reading  math  and writing 
in addition  the company provides test generation software to educational publishers  and in  began selling enterprise software for training and knowledge management to corporate customers 
the company acquired a software development firm in late specializing in web based applications to assist in creating web versions of the company s existing products and new web products 
the company s sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  software support agreements  and training seminars and programs 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of its off the shelf software products at the time of shipment to customers 
the company records the estimated cost of returns at the time of sale 
the company also develops custom software products through its subsidiary  ips publishing  inc the company recognizes revenue from the sale of custom software on the percentage of completion method 
service revenue includes both revenue relating to renaissance professional development training and revenue from software support agreements for ongoing customer support 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of its training seminars and programs primarily at the time the seminar or training program is conducted 
revenue from separately sold software support agreements is reflected as deferred revenue and is amortized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
the company s deferred revenue represents payments received from customers for services still to be rendered 
because software products are generally shipped as orders are received  the company has historically operated without significant backlog 
however  it is the company s practice to announce new products prior to the time at which such products will be ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in a significant backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
the introduction of products in certain periods could cause those periods to have significantly higher sales and higher sales growth rates than subsequent periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of software products  support agreements  and training seminars and programs 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs associated with the manufacture and assembly of the company s products  including the cost of purchased optical mark card scanners  and iii an allocation of facilities costs 
the company recognizes significantly higher gross margins on its product sales than on its service sales 
product sales as a percentage of total sales have remained relatively constant 
gross profit margins on products have decreased due to mix associated with the hardware component of the company s new math products 
an optical mark card scanner is included with the sale of all accelerated math software and  in many cases  additional scanners are sold 
although scanners are profitable  the gross profit margin on hardware is not as high as the gross profit margin on software 
the company began shipment of math products late in management anticipates that product gross profit margins will continue to decrease somewhat in due to the impact of anticipated increased sales of accelerated math software and hardware as a percentage of total product sales 
gross profit margins on service sales have decreased primarily due to lower profitability of seminars in while the company trained over  educators in its renaissance training programs in  an increase of over educators trained in  increased numbers of seminars in smaller markets resulted in lower average attendance at seminars for which costs are relatively fixed  resulting in an increase in costs as a percentage of sales for training 
increased costs of providing technical support related to software support agreements associated with the company s broader product lines also had a negative impact on service gross profit margins in management anticipates that service margins may continue to decrease somewhat in as increased costs related to providing technical support for the company s new products will continue in the company expenses all product development costs associated with a product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales generally using the straight line method over months 
in  the company acquired three software firms computeractive  inc computeractive  an ottawa  canada based software development firm specializing in web based applications  generation learning systems  llc generation  a training and knowledge management enterprise software firm in golden  colorado  and humanities software  incorporated humanities  an oregon based firm specializing in writing software

the company s net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in product sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in product sales is primarily attributable to i sales of the company s new math products into more than  schools since shipment began in late and ii increased sales of accelerated reader title disks  with over  available book titles  to a larger base of accelerated reader schools 
service revenue  which consists of revenue from sales of training sessions and software support agreements  increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increased number of renaissance training sessions and to an increase in revenue from one year software support agreements associated with new product sales 
while revenue growth was more than over levels for both products and services in the first half of  growth rates over the previous year were considerably lower in the third and fourth quarters of because the company s new version of accelerated reader shipped in late september and october  the company missed the prime fall buying season for schools  which slowed follow on purchases of accelerated reader title disks as well as adoptions by new schools in late management expects the effects of this delay in shipment to continue to have some impact into early  as schools take time to install the new accelerated reader software before returning to their normal buying patterns 
the company anticipates that several new initiatives announced in will positively impact continued growth over the long term in the sale of its reading software products 
in june  the company announced that its reading and language arts software products won approval in california s state adoption of curriculum materials 
gaining approval means that schools that want to purchase the company s reading and writing skills software can pay for them using certain state curriculum materials funds 
other key events during the year included the first district wide sale of school renaissance  the company s comprehensive school improvement program  shipment of the company s improved version of its accelerated reader and star reading software  the introduction of web based on line ordering and delivery of accelerated reader quizzes  and an alliance with the mcgraw hill school division to provide educators and students with access to hundreds of interactive computer quizzes aligned to the mcgraw hill elementary school reading series

additionally  costs of providing software technical support increased as the company broadened its product lines and introduced new versions of existing products 
management anticipates that service margins will continue to decrease somewhat in as increased costs related to providing technical support for the company s new products will continue in management expects that service revenues will be positively impacted in the first quarter of as the company presented its first annual national school renaissance conference in february the company s overall gross profit margin decreased to in from in due to decreased gross profit margins on both products and services 
product development 
product development expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to increased staff and consulting costs associated with developing new products and seminars including new versions of the company s accelerated reader and star reading software  additional accelerated reader quizzes  the new school renaissance district wide improvement program  and several products not yet released
