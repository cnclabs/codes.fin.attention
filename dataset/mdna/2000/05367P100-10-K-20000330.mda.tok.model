gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  test  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  and sales of aftermarket hardware products 
gross margin decreased to in compared to in  which had increased from in the decrease during was primarily due to price reductions in certain product lines  as well as by discounting and promotions offered 
in addition  there was a shift in mix to lower margin product families and lower priced models within product families

during  the company incurred other charges of million relating to in process research and development in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage 
in  the company announced and implemented a restructuring plan to strategically refocus the company and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues  with the goal of restoring long term profitability to the company and supporting the company s new strategic initiatives 
the process included a reevaluation of the company s core competencies  technology plans and business model  and was completed in tandem with development of the company s fiscal operating plan 
the major elements of the resulting restructuring plan included the termination of certain employees and the vacating of certain facilities 
the plan also provides for no further releases of a limited number of existing product offerings  including stand alone marquee  avid cinema  media illusion and matador 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the charge includes approximately million for severance and related costs for employees on a worldwide basis  million for facility vacancy costs and approximately  of non cash charges relating to the disposition of certain fixed assets 
the company currently expects that the restructuring actions will result in an expense reduction of approximately million as disclosed above on an annualized basis 
these savings will likely be largely offset by incremental costs associated with new strategic initiatives and the growth of the company  however  there can be no assurance that such expected savings will be realized 
during  the company made cash payments of million related to these restructuring activities 
the majority of the remaining accrual balance at december  of million is expected to be paid out during the first half of all employees had been informed of their termination and related benefits as of december  in december  the company entered into an agreement to sell its italian subsidiary to a third party  which will establish the entity as a distributor of avid products

during  cash payments of approximately  were made and  at december   the related accrual was approximately million 
the company currently expects to make cash payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to these obligations 
in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage  the company allocated million to in process research and development 
in process research and development represented development projects in areas that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  its value of million was expensed as of the acquisition date and was reflected as a special charge to operations in the amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development were based on results of an independent appraisal 
the values of in process research and development were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
in process research and development projects identified at the acquisition date included next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software  and new graphic  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing applications for editing 
a description of each project follows o next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product principally relate to completion of the animation and real time playback architecture  completion and integration of architectural software components  validation of the resulting architecture  and finalization of the feature set 
as of the acquisition date  the company assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million 
the company has incurred approximately million on this project through december  and currently expects to incur additional costs of during fiscal year total development costs to complete this project are higher than originally anticipated due to challenges encountered in the development process which have caused a significant delay in the release of the product 
this project is expected to be completed during the first half of  at which time the company expects to begin to benefit economically 
however  risk is associated with the completion of any project  and the company cannot be assured that the project will meet with either technological or commercial success 
if this project is not successfully developed or commercially viable  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
o new graphics  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product related principally to the rebuilding of the framework architecture  the rewriting of software code of the compositing engine to accommodate significant new features  and the rewriting of software code of the titling component 
as of the acquisition date  the company had assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million 
the project was completed in december at a cost of approximately million 
development costs were higher than originally anticipated due to the addition of features and functionality  which expanded the scope of the original project 
the value of in process research and development  specifically  was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process projects into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  discounting the net cash flows back to their present values  and adjusting that result to reflect each project s stage of completion 
the expected cash flows of the in process projects were adjusted to reflect the contribution of completed and core technologies 
at the time of acquisition  total revenues from these in process projects were forecasted to peak in and then to decline from to as new products were expected to be introduced by the company 
these revenue forecasts were based on management s estimate of market size and growth  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
a discount rate of was used for valuing the in process research and development 
the discount rate was higher than the company s implied weighted average cost of capital due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development and the related risk of realizing cash flows from products that have not yet reached technological feasibility  among other factors 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage  the company allocated million to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies  work force and trade name and million to goodwill 
included in the operating results for and is amortization of these intangible assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
see notes p and r to the consolidated financial statements

the balance of the intangible assets  including goodwill  was million at december  approximately million is expected to be amortized in with the remaining million expected to be amortized through july the amounts allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets were based on results of an independent appraisal 
the values of completed technologies were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
as of the acquisition date  total revenues from the completed technologies were forecasted to peak in and to decline through the company discounted the net cash flows of the completed technologies to their present value using a discount rate of 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  consists of interest income  other income and interest expense 
other income and expense  net  of million for  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased approximately million from which  in turn  increased  from for the years ended december  and december   other income and expense  net  changed primarily due to the lower cash and investment balances during the period 
provision for benefit from income taxes the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  for   and the tax rate for includes the impact of establishing a full valuation allowance against us related deferred tax assets 
based on the level of us related deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us taxable income  management has determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  the company s effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes and the us federal research tax credit 
the tax rate for includes a benefit of million related to the pre tax charge of for in process technology associated with the company s acquisition of softimage 
at that time  a portion of the charge was not deductible for us federal tax purposes 
excluding the charge and related tax benefit  the company s effective tax rate would have been for the effective tax rate  excluding the charge and related tax benefit of  and effective tax rate of are different from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the company s foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed in the aggregate at a lower rate  and the us federal research tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
with respect to cash flow  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in during  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization and changes in deferred taxes  as well as decreases in accounts receivable 
this was offset by reductions in income taxes payable and accrued expenses 
during  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for the charge for in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of softimage and depreciation and amortization 
during net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income adjusted for depreciation  as well as increases in accounts payable and income taxes payable and reductions in inventory 
in  the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to provisions for profit sharing  while the reduction in inventory resulted from improved inventory turnover 
the company purchased million of property and equipment and other assets during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these purchases were primarily of hardware and software for the company s information systems and equipment to support research and development activities 
the company also utilized cash of million in its acquisition of softimage in additionally  the company made a payment of million in against the note issued to microsoft in connection with the acquisition of softimage 
the note issued to microsoft corporation in connection with the acquisition is due and payable in june see note p to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company entered into an unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks which provided for up to million in revolving credit 
the line of credit agreement was terminated by the company in november the company believes existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements  including capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
in the event the company requires additional financing  the company believes that it would be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that it would be successful in doing so  or that it could do so on terms favorable to the company 
on october   february  and october   the company announced that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million  million and million shares  respectively  of the company s common stock 
purchases have been and will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the company has used and plans to continue to use any repurchased shares for its employee stock plans 
during  the company repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million  which completed the program announced in october during  the company repurchased approximately million additional shares of common stock at a cost of million  which completed the program announced during february and initiated the program announced in october these purchases include the repurchase of  shares from intel corporation intel 
intel originally purchased approximately million shares of avid common stock in march during  the company repurchased a total of million shares of common stock at a cost of million  under the program announced in october as of december   there are approximately  shares remaining authorized for repurchase 
year readiness disclosure in  the company established a worldwide program to address its software and hardware product and customer concerns  its internal business systems  including technology infrastructure and embedded technology systems  and the compliance of its suppliers 
this program was designed to minimize the possibility of significant year interruptions 
possible worst case scenarios include the interruption of significant parts of the company s business as a result of critical business systems failures or failures experienced by suppliers  resellers  or customers 
any such interruption could have a material adverse impact on future results 
since the possibility of such interruptions could not be eliminated  the company engaged a significant number of cross functional resources with technical  business  legal  and financial expertise as part of its program 
by december   the company had generally completed its overall planned year program activities 
this program included the following phases identification  assessment  testing  remediation  and contingency planning  and encompassed the company s past and current products  the company s internal business systems  and the company s mission critical third party suppliers and service providers such as inventory suppliers  equipment suppliers  financial institutions  landlords  and resellers 
details of the program were most recently provided in the company s third quarter form q 
a few tasks that remained for completion in december were reviewed and ultimately reclassified as unnecessary since they posed little to no significant risk to the company or were adequately covered by existing contingency plans 
to date  the company has experienced only a few minor effects on its internal business systems attributable to the year date change  none of which had a material impact on the company 
so far as the company is currently aware  only one product exhibited an isolated and minor processing error during the leap year change  which was quickly corrected  is not expected to recur  and had no material impact on the product  customers  or the company 
the company has also received no reports to date of adverse effects from the year date change on its third party service providers 
because the program is complete  the office overseeing the program has ceased its operations 
if any year issues arise  the company expects to handle them as part of the company s normal operations 
as calendar year progresses  the company expects to continue monitoring pertinent information relating to the company s year readiness as a whole  and to its products  internal business systems and third party suppliers in particular 
any subsequent information could require the company to take additional steps to ensure the year readiness of company 
the costs of the year readiness program were primarily costs of existing internal resources and expertise combined  with small incremental external spending for resources such as consultants or updates 
the entire cost of the program was approximately million 
although the company does not  as a general practice  track internal personnel costs  the company included estimates of such costs in the above program cost estimate 
costs for business system replacements or upgrades unrelated to year issues were not included in this estimate 
no future material product readiness costs are anticipated 
based on the company s ongoing evaluation of internal information and other systems  as well as the currently available information about third parties  the company remains confident and does not anticipate significant business interruptions relating to year issues that would have a material impact on the company 
nevertheless  the possibility remains that the company could be effected by as yet unreported or undiscovered year issues affecting its products  internal business systems  or third party suppliers 
the company acknowledges that it is not in a position to evaluate or resolve all potential year scenarios  such as those involving third parties  and therefore remains uncertain as to whether or to what extent the company may actually be affected by any particular year issue 
if the company s contingency plans prove to be inadequate  if business interruptions occur or last for an extended period of time  if third party products or suppliers are adversely affected  if alternatives are not available at reasonable costs  or if a significant year issue should go undetected  the company could also face a material adverse impact on its future results 
european monetary union on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of that date  the participating countries agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency 
however  the legacy currencies will also remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties may elect to pay or charge for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency 
the company began conducting certain business transactions in the euro on january   and will change its functional currencies for the effected countries to the euro by the end of the three year transition period 
the conversion to the euro has not had and is not expected to have a significant operational impact or a material financial impact on the results of operations  financial position  or liquidity of the company s european businesses 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas defers the implementation of sfas by one year 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after january  for the company  and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain views of the staff on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the staff believes that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company does not expect the application of sab to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following the company s core video editing market predominantly uses avid products and future growth in this market is limited 
accordingly  the company has expanded its product line to address the digital media production needs of the television broadcast news market  online film and video finishing market and the emerging market for multimedia production tools  including the corporate market 
the company has limited experience in serving these markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such products successfully  that such products will achieve widespread customer acceptance  or that the company will be able to develop distribution and support channels to serve these markets 
a significant portion of the company s future growth will depend on customer acceptance in these and other new markets 
any failure of such products to achieve market acceptance  any additional costs and expenses incurred by the company to improve market acceptance of such products and to develop new distribution and support channels  or the withdrawal from the market of such products or of the company from such new markets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s plans for future growth in the internet broadcast market depends on increased use of the internet for the creation  use  manipulation and distribution of media content  from corporate markets to the highest end post production 
such uses of the internet are currently at an early stage of development and the future evolution of the internet in the media broadcast market is not clear 
because a significant portion of the company s business strategy depends on its internet initiative  its business may suffer if commercial use of the internet fails to grow in the future 
as another component of its internet initiative  the company recently launched the avid production network site to provide interactive information and services to new media and post production professionals 
the company s plans for the avid production network include content hosting  remote reviewing and stock footage availability 
because materials may be posted on  and or downloaded and subsequently distributed to others from the avid production network site  the company may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  or other theories based on the nature  content  publication and distribution of such materials 
as a result of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as privacy  distribution and content 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet  and the company s internet related business and could place additional financial burdens on the company s business 
the company s gross margin fluctuates based on various factors 
such factors include the mix of products sold  the cost and the proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product and platform upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  the costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with errors or flaws  provisions for inventory obsolescence  allocations of overhead costs to manufacturing and of customer support costs to cost of goods  sales of third party computer hardware to distributors  and competitive pressure on selling prices of products 
the company s systems and software products typically have higher gross margins than storage devices and product upgrades 
gross profit varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
the company  from time to time  adds functionality and features to its systems 
if such additions are accomplished through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and if the company does not increase the price of such systems to offset these increased costs  the company s gross margins on such systems would be adversely affected 
the company sells most of its products and services through indirect channels such as distributors and resellers 
resellers and distributors typically purchase software and kits from the company and other turnkey components from other vendor sources in order to produce complete systems for resale 
as the majority of the company s sales are through the indirect channel model  it has a significant dependence on its resellers and their third party component suppliers 
any disruption to its resellers or their suppliers may adversely affect the company s revenue and gross margin 
the company s operating expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
further  in many cases  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  the company s operating results may be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to operate profitably 
the company s success depends in large part upon the services of a number of key employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s success will also depend in significant part upon its ability to continue to attract highly skilled personnel to fill a number of vacancies 
effective october   william j 
miller resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the company 
william l 
flaherty  the company s chief financial officer and treasurer  has assumed the role of acting chief executive officer while the company s board of directors conducts a search for a new chief executive officer 
there can be no assurance that the company s board of directors will be successful in its search for a new chief executive officer or in attracting and or retaining key employees generally 
certain of the company s products operate only on specific computer platforms 
the company currently relies on apple computer  inc  ibm and intergraph as the sole manufacturers of such computer platforms 
there can be no assurance that the respective manufacturers will continue to develop  manufacture  and support such computer platforms suitable for the company s existing and future markets or that the company will be able to secure an adequate supply of computers on the appropriate platforms  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is dependent on a number of suppliers as sole source vendors of certain key components of its products and systems 
components purchased by the company from sole source vendors include video compression chips manufactured by c cube microsystems  a small computer systems interface scsi accelerator board from atto technology  a d digital video effects board from pinnacle systems  application specific integrated circuits asics from chip express and lsi logic  digital signal processing integrated circuits from motorola  a fibre channel adapter card from jni  a fibre channel storage array from the clariion division of emc  and a pci expansion chassis from magma inc the company purchases these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
the company also manufactures certain circuit boards under license from a subsidiary of pinnacle systems 
the company generally does not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and has no guaranteed supply arrangements 
no assurance can be given that sole source suppliers will devote the resources necessary to support the enhancement or continued availability of such components or that any such supplier will not encounter technical  operating or financial difficulties that might imperil the company s supply of such sole source components 
while the company believes that alternative sources of supply for sole source components could be developed  or systems redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  its business and results of operations could be materially affected if it were to encounter an untimely or extended interruption in its sources of supply 
the markets for digital media editing and production systems are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
the company encounters competition in the video and film editing and effects and professional audio markets 
many current and potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than the company 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those of the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in its target markets or that future competition will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar  therefore  could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
the company attempts to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on results through the use of forward exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency denominated third party and intercompany net receivables or payable balances 
the company has generally not hedged transactions with external parties  although it periodically reevaluates its hedging practices 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including patent litigation  an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings and note l to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and the effect of volatility in currencies on asset and liability positions of its international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange risk the company derives greater than of its revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the local currency 
this circumstance exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can impact revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables and payables of its foreign subsidiaries 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on the contracts are recorded in results of operations  offsetting losses and gains on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   the company had million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  denominated in various european  asian and canadian currencies  as a hedge against forecasted foreign denominated receivables and payables 
net gains of million resulting from forward exchange contracts were included in the results of operations in  which offset net losses on the related asset and liabilities of million 
a hypothetical percent change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a percent change would offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities  consisting of short term government obligations  state and municipal bonds  and commercial paper 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
