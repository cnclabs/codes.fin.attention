item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk with respect to its debt outstanding and foreign currency transactions 
most of the company s long term borrowings are based on fixed interest rates and therefore not subject to material risk from changes in interest rates 
short term borrowings  however  are based on prime or other indicative base rates plus a premium 
if these indicative base rates increase  the company will incur higher relative interest expense and similarly  a decrease in the rates will reduce relative interest expense 
in recent years  there have not been significant fluctuations in the prime or other indicative base rates 
a change in the prime rate or other indicative base rates would not materially change interest expense assuming levels of debt consistent with historical amounts 
due to the company s international operations  certain transactions are conducted in foreign currencies 
the company s italian operations hedge against transactional risks by borrowing against its receivables and against economic risk by buying monthly call options to strike at a rate equal to or above the budgeted exchange rate
