wind river s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as under the caption business  including additional risk factors that may affect future results of operations 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to wind river on the date hereof  and wind river assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
wind river was founded in to provide consulting and custom software development services for a variety of business clients 
from its inception  wind river directed its development efforts towards real time and embedded system applications and released its first commercial product  vxworks registered trademark  in wind river subsequently broadened its product offerings both internally and through technology and business acquisitions  and has become a leading provider of operating systems and development tools for the real time embedded systems marketplace 
wind river has invested heavily in the development and introduction of its products and in the establishment of worldwide sales  distribution  customer support and consulting capabilities 
wind river markets its products on a worldwide basis through its direct sales force  distributors and value added resellers 
wind river provides sales  marketing and product support for foreign customers through wholly owned subsidiary companies in the united states  europe and a majority owned subsidiary in japan 
wind river typically charges a one time fee for a development license and a run time license fee for each copy of wind river s operating system embedded in the customer s product 
a key component of wind river s strategy is to significantly increase revenue through run time license fees 
any increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to run time licenses will depend on wind river s successful negotiation of run time license agreements and on the successful commercialization by wind river s customers of the underlying products 
in may  wind river acquired zinc software  incorporated  a privately held company that develops  markets and supports graphical application software 
in connection therewith  wind river issued  shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of zinc 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests

during april  wind river entered into an asset purchase agreement with xact pursuant to which wind river acquired certain office and other equipment from xact and revised the terms of an existing distribution agreement with xact 
subsequently  but not pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  wind river hired a significant number of xact employees 
as a result of these events  wind river believes the future operations and cash flows of xact have become uncertain and that wind river s original investment is not recoverable 
accordingly  wind river recognized a charge totaling  for the difference between the carrying amount of its investment and the net realizable value during the first quarter of fiscal year on june   wind river acquired routerware  incorporated  a california corporation that develops and markets a suite of software modules used in data communications products such as bridges  routers  gateways  and remote access servers

the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data and its percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended january  in thousands revenues products    services    total revenues    cost of revenues cost of revenues products    services    total cost of revenues    gross profit    operating expenses operating expenses selling and marketing    product development and engineering    general and administrative    acquisition related and other   amortization of goodwill purchased intangibles total operating expenses    income from operations    other income  net    income before provision for income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    net income before the effect of the adjustment for acquisition related and other charges of   after tax was  or of total revenue for the year ended january  the adjustment resulted from the acquisition of in process technologies from liberate technologies  inc and objective software technology  ltd 
years ended january  and revenues revenues for fiscal year were million compared to million for fiscal product revenues consist of licensing fees from operating system and software development tool products and fees from embedded system run time licenses 
service revenues are derived from software development and porting contracts  software maintenance and support contracts  customer training and consulting 
software maintenance and support contracts are generally sold separately from the software licenses and tools 
the increase in revenues of is due to increases in both product revenues and service revenues 
product revenues accounted for approximately and of the total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  with service revenues accounting for the balance of total revenue over this period 
product revenues were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of in product revenues was due primarily to the continued acceptance of wind river s products  to an increase in run time license revenues as customer developed products continue to be accepted by end users and to the expansion of our product lines resulting from research and development  including the tornado ii integrated development environment  and the integration of products from acquired companies  including tornado for managed switches from xact and network protocols from routerware 
product revenues are generally recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master in satisfaction of non cancelable contractual agreements provided that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
service revenues were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of was primarily due to increases in revenue from maintenance support agreements  both new and recurring and training resulting from the increase in wind river s installed base of tornado software development environments and software applications provided to customers 
in addition  revenue from professional services increased as wind river placed additional strategic emphasis in this area 
in addition  through the acquisition of integrated systems  we expect the percentage of revenue from services to increase 
maintenance contracts are generally prepaid  with the revenue recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
deferred revenue results primarily from customer prepayments under software maintenance  which are recognized ratably over the life of the agreements and certain run time agreements  which are recognized as target licenses are delivered  and professional services and engineering services contracts or training arrangements  which are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from international sales were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal international revenues accounted for and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
revenues from european sources increased from fiscal to while revenues from japan increased over the same period 
wind river expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenues  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
revenues derived from indirect sales channels worldwide represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
significant portions of these indirect revenues are attributable to revenues from wrskk  a japanese subsidiary in which we own and three distributors own each 
wind river sells products to wrskk at discounts that approximate those offered to other independent distributors of wind river s products 
wind river s international sales are denominated in the local currencies  and an increase in the relative value of the dollar against such currencies would reduce wind river s revenues in dollar terms or make wind river s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
wind river actively monitors its foreign currency exchange exposure  and to date such exposures have not had a material impact on wind river s results of operations to date 
wind river enters into forward contracts to hedge the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues from asia pacific sources including japan represented of international revenues for both fiscal and see business additional risk factors that may affect future results of operations 
our international business activities subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business 
cost of products cost of products was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal product related cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues remained at for both fiscal and as a result  gross profit margins for products remained constant at 
product related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for production employees  product media  and royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software and documentation and packaging 
wind river s cost of revenue as a percentage of product revenues will be affected in the future by the distribution rights related to the introduction of new products  including tornado ii and a next generation tornado product  tornado for embedded internet products and tornado for managed switches and by royalty payments to third parties for sales related to their products which are integrated into our technology and are sold as support tools 
during fiscal  wind river introduced a new pricing model in which it created product bundles that include third party tools that were previously sold separately 
as a result  wind river has experienced an increase in absolute dollars paid to third party vendors for their software tools 
we expect the amount paid to third party vendors in the future to increase in absolute dollars 
amortization of capitalized software development costs included in cost of products amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
capitalized software development costs were fully amortized as of january  through our acquisition of integrated systems  wind river will amortize approximately  of capitalized software development costs in each of the next quarters 
cost of services cost of services was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal service related cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenues was and for fiscal and  respectively 
service related cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization as well as costs to recruit  develop  and retain services professionals 
the increase in costs of service revenues is due to our investment in developing new services offerings and the addition of new personnel and certified third party contractors to our professional services organization 
we expect the cost of service revenues will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our customer support staff  customer support capabilities and professional services organization 
in addition  we expect our cost of services as percentage of total revenues to increase as we invest more resources in professional services through integrated systems doctor design unit 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from increases in sales and marketing personnel both domestically and internationally and increased advertising 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to resulted primarily from the growth of sales and marketing personnel  field engineers  expenses related to marketing and advertising programs and third party marketing costs for product introductions  including tornado ii  and promotions 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs 
product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and engineering expenses increased from to from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase in product development and engineering expenses is primarily due to the increase in staff and associated support for engineers to expand and enhance wind river s product line  including the costs associated with integrating the xact engineering team wind river hired in april and integrating the engineering staff added as a result of the acquisition of routerware in june in addition  wind river had  of funded research and development for fiscal year related to our center of excellence initiative 
we believe that product development and engineering expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the investment in the internal development of new products  technologies  and through acquisitions of companies and technologies 
see business additional risk factors that may affect future results of operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the growth in infrastructure investments in the areas of information systems  finance and administration and worldwide staff 
in  wind river commenced a worldwide financial business and production systems replacement project that uses software primarily from oracle 
the new systems brought wind river s business and production computer systems into compliance with year requirements and will create the financial system infrastructure backbone to support integration of acquired company s financial systems 
the financial and production systems became operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in fiscal years and  wind river incurred and million  respectively  to implement the oracle software 
wind river believes that general and administrative expenses will increase as it continues to invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems  finance and administration and integrating the financial and administrative operations of integrated systems 
we allocate the total costs for information technology and facilities to each of the functional areas that uses the information technology and facilities services based on their headcount 
information technology allocated costs include salaries  information technology  project costs  communication costs and depreciation expense for shared infrastructure costs 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  depreciation expenses for office furniture and other department operating costs 
acquisition related costs acquisition related costs were million for fiscal these costs relate to the integration of integrated systems into wind river  the acquisition of routerware and the costs associated with hiring the xact employees  acquiring equipment and other assets of xact and revising a second distribution agreement for another product with xact 
as a result of future events  wind river believes the future operations and cashflows of xact have become uncertain and that wind river s original investment is not recoverable 
accordingly  wind river has recognized a charge totaling  for the difference between the carrying amount of its investment and the net realizable value 
in connection with the acquisition of integrated systems  we expect to incur integration costs in fiscal the costs estimated to be incurred in fiscal is approximately million of which the majority is expected to be incurred during the first quarter 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and purchased technology increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal amortization of goodwill and purchased technology includes the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets relating to various purchase acquisitions 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect to expense approximately million of goodwill and purchased technology and write off approximately million of in process research and development as a result of recent acquisitions 
during the following quarters  we expect to expense approximately million of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
the million per quarter primarily consists of amortization of goodwill and purchased technology relating to the acquisition of embedded support tools corporation 
the increase is primarily due to our recent acquisition of est 
wind river s results from operations will also be affected in the future by the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles related to the acquisition of audesi 
other income and expense other income and expense includes interest income earned from the investment of excess cash  interest expense incurred on the convertible subordinated notes  due in issued in july  gains and losses related to inter company foreign currency transactions and income and losses related to the minority interest held by the japanese participants in wrskk

total cash  investments and restricted cash at january  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
net interest expense and other was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in net interest expense and other is related to a charge during the first quarter of  relating to the difference between the carrying amount of our investment in xact and the net realizable value and a distribution agreement with xact because xact was unable to complete the development of their product that is subject to the distribution agreement 
the company also incurred interest on the notes and amortization of certain issuance costs associated with the notes

innotech corporation  kobe steel ltd 
and nissin electric ltd  the other partners in the joint venture  each owns a equity interest 
provision for taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the overall changes in the effective tax rates result primarily from difference between foreign and domestic tax rates and the ratio of foreign taxable income to domestic taxable income  varying levels of available research and development credits and certain non deductible acquisition costs related to routerware

wind river invests primarily in instruments that are highly liquid and of investment grade 
in fiscal  wind river s operating activities provided net cash of million due primarily to net income  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization  the increase in income taxes payable  an increase in deferred revenue and the tax benefit related to employee stock option exercises 
these sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increased sales activities in response to higher customer demand for wind river s products and services and certain delays in the collection of invoices as a result of the implementation of oracle financial system 
the increase in prepaid and other current assets is primarily due to a receivable relating to an equity investment sale  interest receivable on investments  prepaid merger costs  prepaid royalty costs and prepaid sales expenses 
in fiscal  wind river s investing activities used net cash of million 
uses of cash relating to the purchases of investments  purchases of investments held as collateral for the second operating lease and the acquisition of equipment were partially offset by cash provided from the sale of investments 
as wind river transitioned its investment portfolio from short term to long term investments  its long term investments increased by million 
restricted cash increased due to the new collateral funding for the second corporate facility operating lease discussed further below 
the collateral consists of direct obligations of the united states government  with the majority being long term investments 
in fiscal  wind river s financing activities provided net cash of million 
cash provided by the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and the line of credit through a japanese subsidiary were offset by a treasury stock repurchase and a loan to a member of the board of directors for the purchase of wind river stock 
during fiscal  wind river repurchased approximately  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in june  the board of directors rescinded all stock repurchase authorizations 
we have not made any repurchases since march  on september   our chief executive officer signed a secured promissory note with the company to borrow up to million 
as of january   the ceo had borrowed million against this note 
in july  wind river issued million of convertible subordinated notes the notes  which mature on august  the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible into shares of wind river s common stock at a price of per share 
the notes are redeemable at the option of wind river  in whole or in part  at any time on or after august  at of the principal amount initially  and thereafter at prices declining to at maturity  in each case plus accrued interest 
each holder of these notes has the right  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  to require wind river to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes  in whole or in part  owned by such holder  at specified repurchase prices plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of certain events 
the million of costs incurred in connection with the offering are included in prepaid and other assets 
these unamortized costs are being amortized to interest expense over the year term of the notes using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
interest on the notes began accruing july  and is payable semi annually on february and august  commencing on february  on february   wind river acquired integrated systems  inc in connection with the acquisition  wind river issued an aggregate of  shares of wind river common stock for all outstanding shares of integrated systems common stock 
in addition  approximately  of integrated systems stock options became options to purchase approximately  shares of wind river stock 
on march   wind river acquired embedded support tools corporation

in fiscal  wind river entered into an operating lease for its new headquarters facility constructed on land owned by wind river in alameda  california 
construction was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year the lease was finalized in august and the lessor has funded a total of million of construction costs 
the operating lease payments began in august and are based on the total construction costs of the property  including capitalized interest  and libor 
in fiscal  wind river entered into a second operating lease agreement for the construction of two additional buildings at its headquarters facility 
as of january   the lessor has funded a total of million of construction costs and has committed to fund up to a maximum of million 
construction of the buildings is currently expected to be completed in january the operating lease payments will vary based upon the total construction costs of the property  which include capitalized interest and libor 
in connection with the lease of wind river s current headquarters  wind river is obligated to enter into a ground lease of its land in alameda  california with the lessor of the building at a nominal rate and for a term of years 
if wind river terminates or does not negotiate an extension of the building lease the ground lease converts to a market rental rate 
the ground lease provides wind river with the option at the end of the lease terms to either acquire the buildings at the lessor s original cost or arrange for the buildings to be acquired 
wind river has guaranteed the residual value associated with the buildings under the first operating lease and second operating lease to the lessor of approximately and  respectively  of the lessor s actual funding of million on the first operating lease and obligated funding of million on the second operating lease  respectively 
wind river is also required to deposit fixed income securities with a custodian as a deposit to secure the performance of its obligations under the lease 
in addition  under the terms of the lease  wind river must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants 
as of january   wind river was in compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the contingent liability relating to the residual value guarantee will not have a material adverse effect on wind river s financial condition or results of operations 
on march   wind river entered into an accreting interest rate swap agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate operating lease for its new corporate headquarters 
this agreement effectively changes wind river s interest rate exposure on its operating lease  which is based on the one month libor to a fixed rate of 
the differential to be paid or received under this agreement will be recognized as an adjustment to rent expense related to the operating lease 
the agreement matures at the same time as the operating lease expires 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparty to meet the term of the contract are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparty s obligations exceed the obligations of wind river 
wind river manages potential counterparty credit risk prior to entering into transactions by requiring that all counterparties have at least a aa standard and poor s  or moody s equivalent  long term senior debt rating 
wind river has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
wind river attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in high grade securities 
management believes that wind river s working capital and cash flow generated from operations are sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for planned expansion  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
year issues we reviewed and tested our internal programs and those of our newly acquired businesses and determined that there are no significant year issues within our or their mission critical systems or services 
our review of the third party software we and our subsidiaries use identified certain software patches for third party software that needed to be implemented for year compliance 
all of these patches were implemented prior to january  we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems relating to such systems being unable to recognize appropriate dates related to the year we are also not aware of any material problems with our customers or suppliers 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruption as a result of any year issues 
euro currency on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
since that date  the euro has traded on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january and january  during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in euros  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies from circulation 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
wind river is assessing its pricing and marketing strategy in order to insure that it remains competitive in a broader european market and is reviewing whether certain existing contracts will need to be modified 
wind river has assessed the ability of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies and believes that its information technology systems will not be affected by the transition to the euro 
wind river does not presently expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect wind river s foreign exchange exposures and hedging activities or will result in any material increase in costs to wind river 
wind river s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
final accounting  tax and governmental  legal and regulatory guidance is not available 
wind river will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the euro 
based on current information and our current assessment  we do not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity wind river s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
wind river places its investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  wind river s first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  wind river seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
wind river mitigates default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
wind river believes an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting wind river s floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of january  would have an immaterial effect on wind river s pretax earnings 
wind river also believes the immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of wind river s financial instruments 
foreign currency risk wind river transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in japanese yen and certain european currencies 
wind river has established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency exchange contracts for its foreign currency transaction exposures in japan and certain european countries 
under this program  increases or decreases in wind river s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and loses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
wind river does not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding forward contracts at the end of a period are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net  and thus are recognized in income in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows 
as these forward contracts mature the realized gains and losses are recorded and are included in net income as a component of other income  net 
wind river s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
at january   wind river had outstanding forward contracts to hedge japanese yen with notional amounts totaling approximately million 
the unrealized gains and losses on the outstanding forward contracts at january  were immaterial to wind river s consolidated financial statements 
due to the short term nature of the forward contracts  the fair value at january  was negligible 
the realized gains and losses on these contracts as they matured were not material to the consolidated operations of wind river 
interest rate swap risk in march  wind river entered into a accreting interest rate swap to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating interest rate operating lease for its new headquarters 
at january   the notional amount of the accreting interest rate swap was million 
the estimated fair value at january  was negligible
