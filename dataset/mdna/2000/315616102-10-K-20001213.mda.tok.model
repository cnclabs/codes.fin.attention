item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors  business and elsewhere in this report 
overview f was incorporated on february  and began operations in april our fiscal year ended on september  from our inception through may  we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately million in equity securities 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
in october  we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
for the fiscal years through  our net revenues were million  million and million respectively 
we achieved our first quarterly profit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and our first annual profit in fiscal year currently  we derive approximately of our net revenues from sales of big ip  and we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of big ip in the future 
during fiscal year  one of our resellers  exodus communications  accounted for of our net revenues and of our accounts receivable balance at september  net revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and  in fiscal we plan to continue expanding our international operations significantly  particularly in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets  because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
customers who purchase our products have the option to receive installation services and an initial customer support contract  typically covering a month period 
we generally combine the software license  installation  and customer support elements of our products into a package with a single price 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values when the individual elements are sold separately 
customers may also purchase consulting services and renew their initial customer support contract 
revenues from the sale of our products and software licenses are recognized  net of allowances for estimated returns  when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product 
estimated sales returns are based on historical experience by product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
services revenue for installation is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site 
revenues for customer support are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues from consulting services are recognized at the end of the quarter in which they are performed 
our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net days  but we have extended payment terms beyond net days to some customers 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized ratably over the terms of the arrangement 
our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net days 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of net revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
to maintain profitability we will need to increase our net revenues and manage operating expenses 
although we have experienced rapid growth in net revenues in recent periods  we may not be able to sustain these growth rates to maintain profitability 
we have recorded a total of million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september  these charges represent the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors 
these options generally vest ratably over a four year period 
we are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
and have recorded stock compensation charges of million  million and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we expect to recognize amortization expense related to unearned compensation of approximately million    and during the years ended september    and  respectively 
we cannot guarantee  however  that we will not accrue additional stock compensation costs in the future or that our current estimate of these costs will prove accurate 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated

services include revenue from service and support agreements provided as part of the initial product sale  installation  sales of extended service and support contracts and consulting services 
product revenues 
product revenues increased by  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase in product revenues was due to an increase in the quantity of our products sold  primarily through our indirect sales channels and to a lesser extent through our direct sales channels 
service revenues 
service revenues increased by  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to an increase in the installed base of our products and the renewal of service and support contracts 
international revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended september  and of total revenues for the year ended september  this increase represents the growth in demand for our products and an increase in the number of resellers 
we expect international revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues  although we cannot assure you that these revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
as our net revenue base increases  we do not believe we can sustain percentage growth rates of net revenues that we have experienced historically 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of outsourced hardware components and manufacturing  fees for third party software products integrated into our products  service and support personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  cost of product revenues increased as a percent of product revenues from for the year ended september   to for the year ended september  the increase as a percentage of product revenues was the result of higher production costs associated with hardware configuration enhancements 
the cost of raw materials may increase  which would cause the cost of product revenues to increase and have a negative impact on our gross margin 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  cost of service revenues increased as a percent of service revenues from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the increase in cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenues is due to increased personnel costs which include training and consulting 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff  costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising and trade shows  and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel and professional services personnel from to  and increased advertising and promotional activities 
we expect to continue increasing sales and marketing expenses in order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in product development personnel from to and nonrecurring charges of million consisting of prototype material expenses and a one time licensing agreement 
our future success is dependent  in large part on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated needs of our customers 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs of our executive  finance  human resource and legal personnel  third party professional service fees  and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to an increase in general and administrative personnel from to and a one time executive recruitment charge of million 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our staff  further develop our internal information systems and incur costs associated with being a publicly held company 
unearned compensation 
we recorded stock compensation charges of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
other income expense  net 
other income consists primarily of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income was  for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  there was a one time asset impairment charge of  associated with the move to our new corporate headquarters 
income taxes 
the income tax provision increase from zero in fiscal to million in fiscal the company utilized a portion of its us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal the difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate was due primarily to previous unrecognized deferred tax assets 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not 
based on available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we historically provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on our operating performance  we determined that a certain portion of these assets are more likely than not to be realizable 
as a result  the valuation allowance has been partially reversed against our net deferred assets for these assets which are considered realizable 
we have maintained a valuation allowance on our remaining net operating loss carryforwards as of september  approximately million 
these remaining net operating loss carryforwards primarily relate to the tax benefits associated with our stock option plans  which will be offset against shareholders equity

cost of product revenues increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  cost of product revenues decreased as a percent of product revenues from for the year ended september   to for the year ended september  the decrease as a percentage of product revenues was the result of higher utilization of manufacturing operations  including increased economies of scale achieved from an increase in production 
the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to an increase in product revenues 
the cost of raw materials may increase  which would cause the cost of product revenues to increase and have a negative impact on our gross margin

interest income expense net 
interest income consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalent balances offset by interest expense associated with debt obligations 
net interest expense was  for the year ended september  compared to net interest income of  for the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to the investment of the proceeds received from our initial public offering in june income taxes 
as of september   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  there was no provision for federal or state income taxes for any prior period 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations contained in the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating losses before we can utilize them 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if we do not use them

see risk factors our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
liquidity and capital resources from our inception through may  we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately million in equity securities 
in june we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
in october  we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
cash used in our operating activities was million for the year ended september  cash provided by our operating activities was million for the year ended september  net cash for fiscal year outflows resulted from increases in accounts receivable due to increased sales and other current assets and were partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 
net cash inflows for fiscal year was the result of the company becoming profitable in the second quarter of we anticipate that in the future we may offer financing to certain resellers 
to the extent such financing is offered  cash used in operating activities will increase to fund the increase in outstanding accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september   which includes million used to purchase property and equipment and million used to invest in restricted cash 
the components of restricted cash consist of an irrevocable standby letters of credit  totaling million to fund our commitment to lease office space 
as of september   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement on two buildings for a new corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in july on the first building  and the lease on the second building commenced in october the lease for both buildings expires in with an option for renewal 
the company established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement 
under the term of the lease  a million irrevocable standby letter of credit is required through november  unless the lease is terminated before then 
this amount has been included on the company s balance sheet as of september  as a component of restricted cash 
although we have no other material commitments  we anticipate a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in our operations  infrastructure and personnel 
in the future we may also require a larger inventory of products in order to provide better availability to customers and achieve purchasing efficiencies 
any such increase can be expected to reduce cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not use derivative instruments  therefore the adoption of this statement will not have any effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in december  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  was issued 
this pronouncement summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
sab is required to be adopted by the company for the year ended september  the company is currently reviewing the requirements of sab and assessing its impact on the company s financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a significant portion of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter 
furthermore  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed 
consequently  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  our net income loss will decrease increase because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
see item of part ii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
our success depends on sales of our big ip r 
we currently derive approximately of our net revenues from sales of our big ip product line 
in addition  we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of big ip in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers  our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features 
we expect the internet traffic and content management market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we are currently developing new features for our existing products 
we expect to continue to develop new products and new product features in the future 
if we fail to develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
see item of part i business product development 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging internet traffic and content management market 
our markets are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the internet traffic and content management market include cisco systems  nortel networks  radware and resonate 
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the internet traffic and content management market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing internet traffic and content management solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic and content management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products 
see item of part i business competition 
our expansion into international markets may not succeed 
we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products internationally 
international sales represented of our net revenues for the year ended september   of our net revenues for the year ended september   and for the year ended september  we have engaged sales personnel in australia  europe  asia pacific and latin america 
our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  and we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships 
our sales strategy requires that we establish multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  original equipment manufacturers  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
one of our resellers  exodus communications  accounted for of our net revenues for the year ended september   and of our accounts receivable balance at september  our inability to effectively establish our indirect sales channels will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to attract  train and retain qualified marketing and sales  professional services and customer support personnel 
our products require a sophisticated marketing and sales effort targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting 
our inability to retain and hire qualified sales personnel may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we currently have a professional services and customer support organization and will need to increase our staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of existing customers 
the installation of internet traffic and content management solutions  the integration of these solutions into existing networks and the ongoing support can be complex 
accordingly  we need highly trained professional services and customer support personnel 
hiring professional services and customer support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our inability to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified professional services and customer support personnel that our business needs may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of any key personnel may harm our business and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales and marketing and finance personnel  many of whom will be difficult to replace 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 
we are unable to predict our sales cycle because we have limited experience selling our products 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months 
sales of big ip  dns  global site  see it  and edge fx require us to educate potential customers on their use and benefits 
the sale of our products is subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
the average selling prices of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products 
we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our pre configured  industry standard hardware platforms to three contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from these contract manufacturers in the past which have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
we may experience delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may seriously harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
see item of part i business manufacturing 
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources 
we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
see item of part i business manufacturing 
undetected software errors may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  we have not entered into non competition agreements with several of our former employees 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our contract manufacturers  suppliers or customers with respect to existing or future products 
although we have not been a party to any claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to these claims in the future 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
laws relating to encrypted software may limit the marketability of our products 
the encryption technology contained in our products is subject to united states export controls 
these export controls limit our ability to distribute encrypted software outside of the united states and canada 
while we take precautions against unlawful exportation  this exportation inadvertently may have occurred in the past or may occur from time to time in the future  subjecting us to potential liability and serious harm 
we may also encounter difficulties competing with non united states producers of products containing encrypted software  who may both import their products into the united states and sell products overseas 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury securities  commercial paper and money market funds  which are exempt from size limitation 
the policy limits all short term investments to mature in two years or less  with the average maturity being one year or less 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
maturing in september  three months three months greater than or less to one year one year total fair value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents    weighted average interest rate included in short term investments      weighted average interest rates maturing in september  three months three months greater than or less to one year one year total fair value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents 
   weighted average interest rate included in short term investments     weighted average interest rates foreign currency risk 
currently the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  however we may do so in the future
