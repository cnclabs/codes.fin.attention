overview pervasive software inc is a leading worldwide provider of data management solutions and services which dramatically simplify the development  deployment and management of business applications for small and medium enterprises sme 
our low cost of ownership database product  pervasive 
sql  is widely installed with over million server seats licensed to date 
with pervasive 
sql  software developers isvs create sophisticated yet low maintenance applications that reach beyond the desktop to easily share information from workstations to the web 
our software is designed to be integrated by isvs into their web or client server applications that are sold to smes  which typically have little to no information technology it infrastructure 
our comprehensive approach to selling  marketing and supporting our offerings is designed to drive simplicity into  and mask the complexity of  data management solutions  specifically addressing the specific needs of isvs who build software applications and value added resellers vars who sell and deploy them to smes 
we derive our revenues primarily from shrink wrap licenses through independent software vendors  value added resellers and distributors and through oem license agreements with independent software vendors 
shrink wrap license fees are variable and based generally on user count 
our oem licensing program offers independent software vendors volume discounts and specialized technical support  training and consulting in exchange for embedding our products in software applications and paying us a royalty based on sales of the applications 
additionally  we generate revenues from version upgrades  user count upgrades  upgrades to new or additional platforms and from upgrades to client server or web environments from single user workstation or workgroup environments 
we generally recognize revenues from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
we generally recognize revenues related to agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees when we deliver the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
we recognize per copy royalties in excess of a fixed minimum amount as revenues when such amounts are reported to us 
we operate with virtually no order backlog because our software products are shipped shortly after orders are received 
this makes product revenues in any quarter substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
we reserve for estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights  as well as for uncollectable accounts based on experience 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from our pervasive 
sql and btrieve data management products 
on june   we discontinued general availability of our btrieve products to consolidate our data management related development  marketing and technical support resources behind our current pervasive 
sql products 
accordingly  revenue from the license of pervasive 
sql accounts for substantially all of our data management related revenues in fiscal our future operating results will depend upon continued market acceptance of pervasive 
sql 
pervasive 
sql may not achieve continued market acceptance 
any decrease in demand or market acceptance for our pervasive 
sql product would have a damaging effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in july  we announced a restructuring to focus on our core data management business  including the discontinuation of our tango product line 
the operating results of the tango product line did not achieve expected results and thus we have ceased marketing the tango product 
we are presently continuing to support our current tango customers while attempting to sell the tango product line 
tango has been recorded as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for fiscal and prior years  therefore  the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations 
in addition  as part of the restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately of our worldwide workforce  the majority of which were in research and development and technical support relating to our discontinued tango product line 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended june  revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income from continuing operations interest and other income  net income tax provision income from continuing operations discontinued operations charge for purchased research and development loss from operations income tax benefit loss on disposal loss from discontinued operations net income loss revenues we generated revenues from continuing operations of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  an increase of from fiscal to  and a decrease of from fiscal to we attributed the revenue increase in fiscal year to increased market acceptance of our products operating on windows nt  the introduction of pervasive 
sql in february and ongoing expansion of our worldwide sales organization 
the decrease in revenues from continuing operations in fiscal year was primarily due to lower sales pipelines  the reorganization of our domestic and european sales force during the year  management changes in our worldwide sales organization  management changes in our japanese subsidiary  our past focus of resources and management attention on our discontinued tango product line  competitive forces  and also what we believe to be a general softening in the packaged client server applications market  contributing to decreased orders for our pervasive 
sql products embedded in these applications 
we believe each of these factors could continue to negatively affect license revenues for pervasive 
sql in the future 
licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems increased to approximately of our revenues in fiscal from approximately in fiscal and in fiscal licenses of our software operating on netware represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in and in we believe that the increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to licenses of our products operating on windows nt and other microsoft operating systems is due to the increased market acceptance of our products operating on microsoft platforms and the increased market penetration of microsoft platforms relative to other operating systems 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we released new versions of pervasive 
sql operating on solaris and linux platforms 
revenues to date for these new releases have not been significant 
we expect that the percentages of our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future  or at all 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we attribute the increase in each period primarily to expansion of our international sales organization  principally in europe and japan 
we believe that revenues from international markets represent a significant opportunity 
therefore  we expect that international revenues may continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future as we maintain  modify and potentially expand our international operations  primarily in europe and japan  but also in other areas of the world 
costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support 
cost of revenues and technical support consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support which is typically provided within days of purchase  and license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products 
cost of revenues and technical support for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing   and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
cost of revenues and technical support increased in each period due to increased sales volume  increased technical support and service personnel in the us  europe and japan and increased license fees for third party technologies 
cost of revenues and technical support increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year primarily due to the decline in revenue 
we anticipate that cost of revenues and technical support may increase as a percentage of revenues in the future as we expand our international operations  incur increased license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products  provide technical support for additional products and invest in personnel to deliver professional services and training services to others 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced sales and marketing expenditures and our shifting of significant sales and marketing resources from our database business to our tango product line 
the subsequent increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in fiscal is attributed to lower than anticipated revenue for the period 
sales and marketing expenses increased in dollar amount each period primarily due to increased costs associated with hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  the promotion of pervasive 
sql  and increased infrastructure costs associated with foreign sales office expansion 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue to invest in brand awareness campaigns  promote pervasive 
sql and future extensions of pervasive 
sql  hire additional and more experienced sales and marketing personnel and continue to invest in our international operations 
sales and marketing expenses are likely to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to the timing of costs associated with new product releases  marketing promotions  brand awareness campaigns and international expansion 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in dollar amount each period primarily due to the increased hiring of  and contracting with  additional research and development personnel 
in july  we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately employees the majority of which were in research and development and technical support relating to our discontinued tango product line 
currently  we have employees in research and development dedicated to our pervasive 
sql database products 
accordingly  we anticipate that research and development expenses will be lower in future quarters  however  we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and these expenses are likely to continue to fluctuate as a percent of revenue due to the timing and extent of costs associated with future product development activities 
software development costs incurred in connection with long term development projects are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
we have not capitalized any internal costs through june  related to software development activities 
in july  gary g 
allison was named vice president  engineering 
mr 
allison joined pervasive in october and has held various management positions within the organization  most recently serving as director of developer solutions 
prior to joining pervasive  mr 
allison served as a senior software engineer at dsc communications corporation and held various software development positions at ibm 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and other costs of our finance  human resources  and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
we attribute the increase in dollar amount in each period primarily to the increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations  both domestically and internationally 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue between fiscal years and primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced general and administrative expenditures 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue between fiscal years and primarily because of the decline in revenue during fiscal year we believe that our general and administrative expenses will be similar in dollar amount in future quarters 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to continuing operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates related to continuing operations were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal years and increased primarily due to foreign taxes associated with our increased operations overseas 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
these factors include 
recent declines in revenue related to continuing operations  
the potential impact of anticipated deductions due to exercise of employee stock options on deferred tax assets with limited carryforward periods  
the intensely competitive market in which we operate and which is subject to rapid change 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent domestic deferred tax assets exceed the potential benefit from carryback or carryover of deferred items to offset taxable income in the current year  prior years or the next succeeding year 
we expect our effective tax rate will increase in the future as our foreign taxes associated with our international operations continues to increase as a percent of our worldwide tax expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our provision for income taxes 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations relates to the discontinuation of the tango product line at the end of fiscal total loss from discontinued operations was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  net of income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
the loss in fiscal year includes a million loss from operations and a million charge for estimated loss on disposal  including a reduction of tango related assets to their estimated net realizable values and accrual for twelve months estimated operating costs on the discontinued product line 
the loss in fiscal year is attributable to operating losses of million for the seven month period following our acquisition of the tango product line in november and a million charge for purchased research and development 
we are currently exploring strategic alternatives for the tango product line  including its possible sale 
quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and we believe that all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below 
we also believe that this information presents fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

discontinued operations charge for purchased research and development loss from operations income tax benefit provision loss on disposal loss from discontinued operations net income loss our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
for example  we incurred losses in the quarters ended december  and  march  and june  primarily due to losses from our discontinued tango operations 
we incurred losses from continuing operations in the quarters ended march  and june  primarily due to decreases in revenues from continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by continuing operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from increased earnings related to continuing operations 
the decrease in cash provided by continuing operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from the decrease in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal during fiscal and we invested net amounts of million and million  respectively  in marketable securities  consisting of various taxable and tax advantaged securities 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from the sale or maturity of marketable securities 
in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for our growing employee base and approximately million for furniture and fixtures and improvements related to our new facility in we expect that our capital expenditures will decrease in the next fiscal year as a result of our discontinued tango product line and related workforce reduction 
in november  we acquired of the outstanding stock of everyware development inc  and acquired the remaining outstanding shares in december we financed the acquisition by using available funds of approximately million during the quarter ended december  in july  we discontinued the operations of the tango product line acquired in our purchase of everyware development inc in february  we acquired smithware  inc a developer of database development and reporting components for pervasive products 
we acquired smithware for approximately  consisting of  in cash   shares of our common stock valued at  and acquisition costs of  plus up to an additional  of cash and  shares of common stock payable upon achievement of certain milestones 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we repaid smithware s outstanding debts of approximately  in fiscal  we paid  in cash and issued  shares of our common stock valued at  to the former smithware shareholders upon achieving the first three milestones specified in the acquisition agreement 
in fiscal  we issued  shares of our common stock valued at  to the former smithware shareholders upon achieving the final milestone specified in the acquisition agreement 
in february  we purchased an additional ownership interest in our majority owned subsidiary  pervasive software co  ltd 
formerly known as btrieve technologies japan  ltd  by acquiring stock held by minority shareholders for approximately  in cash 
following this purchase  we held of the outstanding stock of pervasive software co  ltd 
in october  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in pervasive software co  ltd 
by purchasing stock held by a minority shareholder for  in cash 
the october acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method and  accordingly the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired of  was recorded as goodwill and will be amortized over a ten year period 
after the acquisition  we hold of the outstanding stock of pervasive software co  ltd 
in september  we completed an initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering 
in march  we completed a secondary offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering 
on june   we had million in working capital including million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have a binding commitment for a million revolving line of credit with a bank 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers for one year the effective date of statement statement is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning in our fiscal year we do not anticipate that the adoption of statement will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position because of our minimal use of derivatives 
in december  the securities and exchange commission staff released sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we are currently studying the implications of sab no 
 but we believe it will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which further clarifies apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we believe that this interpretation will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
year compliance the year issue results from an industry wide practice of representing years with only two digits instead of four 
beginning in the year  date code fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates or 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
through the first half of the calendar year  we have not experienced any significant problems associated with the year issue 
although it appears that the year issue will not have a significant adverse affect on pervasive  we continue to offer year related support to our customers and monitor the year compliance of our internal systems world wide 
undetected errors in our products or internal systems that may be discovered in the future could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of its transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  the company does have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  the company has operations in japan  germany  france  ireland  england  belgium  and hong kong and conducts transactions in the local currency of each location 
in fiscal the us dollar weakened against the japanese yen 
had the us dollar to japanese yen rate remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million and  respectively 
had the us dollar to japanese yen rate remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income from continuing operations of approximately million and  respectively 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies for fiscal and fiscal was not material 
the company monitors its foreign currency exposure and  from time to time will attempt to reduce its exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for years ended june   and pervasive is subject to interest rate risk on its cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as the company s investment policy requires the company to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
