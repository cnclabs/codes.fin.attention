the residential acquisitions produced increased revenue of million and the sale of two properties reduced revenue by million in fiscal year the remaining residential revenue change was a decrease of million  or

property acquisitions and the assumption of related debt resulted in million of the million increase in total expenses  including a million increase in operating costs  million in additional depreciation  million in additional real estate and taxes  and million in interest expense

ffo is not a substitute for cash flows from operating activities or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo is presented because industry analysts and the company consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of performance of reits 
the following information is included to show the items included in the company s ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands  except per share amounts year five months five months ended ended ended year ended year ended december  december  december  july  july  net income      preferred dividends     minority interest  net income applicable to common shareholders diluted      gains loss on real estate and securities  dilutive preferred a dividends  depreciation and amortization  including depreciation relating to equity investments      non recurring charge  funds from operations      weighted average of common shares outstanding diluted      ffo per share diluted preferred a shares have a dilutive effect on the ffo calculation 
on a pro forma basis  ffo would have been  and  for the five months ended december  and  had the merger been consummated on august  and  respectively 
economic conditions the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  the company believes that many of its existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental such rates may be increased to current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of such leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
many regions of the united states  including regions in which the company owns property  may experience economic recessions 
such recessions  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by discount department stores  supermarkets and drug stores which usually offer day to day necessities rather than high priced luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally continue to maintain their volume of sales despite a slowdown in economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk increases in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow 
as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt 
the company does not believe that the interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt is material as of that date in relation to the approximately billion of outstanding total debt of the company and the approximately billion of total assets of the company 
the company was not a party to any hedging agreements with respect to its floating rate debt as of december  in the event of a significant increase in interest rates  the company would consider entering into hedging agreements with respect to all or a portion of its floating rate debt 
although hedging agreements would enable the company to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities  such agreements would expose the company to the risk that the counterparties to such hedge agreements may not perform  which could increase the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  however  the counterparties to hedging agreements that the company would enter into would be major financial institutions 
the company may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits of any hedging agreements that the company may enter into in the future  would increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and the ability of the company to service its debt 
if the company enters into any hedging agreements in the future  decreases in interest rates thereafter would increase the company s interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt and could result in the company making payments to unwind such agreements 
if the market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt change by or approximately basis points the company s interest expense would change by approximately million  assuming the amount of the company s outstanding floating rate debt remains at million  the balance at december as of december   the company had notes receivable in the total amount of canadian million approximately us million as of december  
the company does not believe that the foreign currency exchange risk associated with these loans is material 
the company had no other material exposure to market risk including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk as of december
