management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations

revenues of  for fiscal year were  above fiscal year s revenues

the company s securities portfolios produced income of  during fiscal year  a decrease of  from last year s income of  this was due primarily to a  reduction in the size of the capital gain distributions from the company s family of mutual funds 
the lower capital gains distributions from the value line mutual funds resulted from management s effective tax planning decisions to minimize capital gain distributions from the company s mutual funds 
the tax planning strategy maintained fund shareholder values while reducing the tax liability for all value line mutual fund shareholders  including the company 
although the company s earnings were lower due to the reduced taxable capital gain distributions  shareholder s equity increased by the appreciation in the value of the long term securities portfolio that resulted from the higher net asset value of the mutual fund shares 
this was a direct result of minimizing the realization of taxable capital gains within the value line mutual funds 
in addition  the lower capital gains from the company s trading portfolio that resulted from a decrease in the average assets invested in this portfolio also contributed to the decline in the income from securities transactions 
liquidity and capital resources value line  inc the company had liquid resources which are used in its business of  at april  in addition to  of working capital  the company had long term securities available for sale with a market value of  that  although classified as non current assets  are also readily marketable should the need arise

this increase to cash flow was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable that resulted from the efficiencies in order processing in the new subscription fulfillment system 
net cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were  higher than fiscal s outflows due primarily to the company s decision during fiscal to invest additional cash in its short term trading portfolio to support its trading strategies 
the receipt of  of proceeds during fiscal  primarily from the sale of the company s north bergen  new jersey vacant operating facility also contributed to the increase from fiscal s cash flow from investing activities 
year yk our year planning was launched in with an initial assessment of the company s systems  its risk of exposure  the steps necessary to achieve yk compliance  and the resources necessary to implement those steps 
the first phase of the plan involved a complete assessment of the company s systems and a survey of vendors 
systems were categorized into three groups mission critical  critical  and non critical 
mission critical systems are systems that would result in a disruption of service or services 
critical systems are defined as those that could cause minor disruption of services 
non critical systems are defined as those that would have no significant impact on operations or services 
the second phase of the project was the actual replacement and or modification of systems and applications 
this phase also included the implementation of the modified applications back into the production environment 
the second phase has been completed since january state of readiness yk we are now well into the third phase of the project testing and further implementation based on test results 
due to the timely and successful initial assessment of the company s year readiness  we are able to continue to enhance our current products  create new products and release updated versions of our electronic products while still maintaining our yk test environments throughout the year 
anticipated costs yk the company s fiscal year expenditures for the yk project were  the company s fiscal year expenditures for the yk project were  the company s fiscal year budget is projected to be  these expenditures include new software and hardware  allocation of staff time  temporary assistance for clerical tasks  legal counsel  testing tools and external  third party monitoring of the company s yk implementation plan 
risks yk we cannot predict with certainty what will happen as the millennium approaches 
we cannot be sure that we will find every problem in the company s systems  that the vendors the company relies upon will find every problem in their systems  or that the securities industry will not experience system failures that will negatively and materially impact value line 
the company will continue to work toward compliance and urge its vendors to do the same  but niether the company  nor its vendors  can predict the future with certainty 
contingency planning yk value line is in the process of finalizing contingency plans to account for the possible failure of every mission critical system 
whether this involves performing tasks manually  or locating alternative vendors for mission critical software and hardware systems  value line is committed to having viable contingency plans developed for every mission critical system 
we continue to reassess and adjust our risk management process and contingency plans 
we believe we have sufficient planning to properly communicate and coordinate any disruption that the turn of the century could cause to our production environment 
we are carefully monitoring our third party vendors and should have a better understanding of their yk readiness by june of we will continue to monitor and evaluate all vendors yk status beyond the year recent aicpa pronouncements the accounting standards committee of the aicpa recently issued statement of position sop which requires entities to adopt uniform rules in their financial statements in accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop requires companies to capitalize as long lived assets  for fiscal years beginning after december   many of the costs associated with developing or obtaining software for internal use to amortize those costs over the software s estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner 
the company capitalized  of expenses during fiscal year that qualifies for amortization under the new statement 
accordingly  earnings have increased to the extent of the capitalized costs net of amortization of  during fiscal year thereafter  assuming capitalized costs remain constant  the initial increase in earnings will diminish as the capitalized costs are amortized 
once the amount capitalized in the first year of application is fully amortized  the increase in earnings due to this accounting change will cease provided the amount capitalized each year remains constant 
management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations 
management anticipates no borrowing for fiscal year
