gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the gross margins for the year to year period was primarily attributable to a higher concentration of electronic commerce sales which traditionally results in lower gross margins than advertising revenues 
the absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues was due to an increase in internet connection costs to support the increase in website traffic  as well as an increase in depreciation expense related to increased equipment costs  costs of merchandise and personnel costs required to support the expansion of our sites and services

the net present value of the happypuppy note at the time of payment was million

the increase in net operating cash used for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the increase in operating losses for the period

these items were partially offset by the payments of capital lease obligations in as of december   we had obligations amounting to million in connection with equipment purchased under capital leases 
these obligations are payable at various intervals between and we expect to meet our current capital lease obligations with our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services  the capital required to maintain our websites  the resources we devote to marketing and selling our services and our brand promotions and other factors 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease arrangements since our inception consistent with the growth in our operations and staffing 
we anticipate that this will continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  and we plan to expand our sales force 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which primarily resulted from our initial and secondary public offerings  together with cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for our existing business for at least months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds during to obtain or operate any acquired businesses or joint venture arrangements 
see risk factors we may need to raise additional funds  including through the issuance of debt 
impact of year year issues related to non compliant information technology systems or non information technology systems operated by us or by third parties may affect us 
we have completed our assessment of our internal and external third party information technology systems and non information technology systems and a test of the information technology systems that support our websites 
we have not experienced any year related issues to date with our internal systems or external third party systems on which we rely 
we do not anticipate any year problems 
we have not incurred any material costs in relation to the evaluation  assessment and testing of its year compliance 
effects of inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation in   and inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations since inception 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet analyzed the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
our limited operating history makes financial forecasting difficult 
theglobe was founded in may accordingly  we have a limited operating history for you to use in evaluating us and our prospects 
our prospects should be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies operating in new and rapidly evolving markets like the internet 
we may not successfully address these risks 
for example  we may not be able to o maintain or increase levels of user and member traffic on our websites  o maintain or increase the percentage of our advertising inventory sold  o maintain or increase both cpm levels and sponsorship revenues  o adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments  o integrate or successfully develop recent acquisitions  o develop or acquire content for our services  o identify  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and o raise sufficient capital to sustain future operations 
revenue growth in prior periods may not be indicative of future growth 
we achieved significant revenue growth during and our limited operating history makes prediction of future growth difficult 
accurate predictions of future growth are also difficult because of the rapid changes in our markets 
accordingly  investors should not rely on past revenue growth rates as a prediction of future growth 
we anticipate increased operating expenses and expect to continue to incur losses 
to date  we have not been profitable  and we expect that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we had net losses of approximately million  million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the principal causes of our losses are likely to continue to be o costs resulting from development and enhancement of our services  o amortization expense related to our acquisitions  o increased sales and marketing expenses necessary to maintain revenue growth and develop brand identity  o growth of our sales force  o expansion of our business facilities and systems infrastructure  and o failure to generate sufficient revenue to compensate for increased costs 
o increased general and administrative expenses  we will need to generate significantly increased revenues to achieve profitability  particularly if we are unable to adjust our expenses in light of any earnings shortfall 
we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate and vary by season 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  due to our limited operating history and our new and unproven business model  we cannot predict our future revenues or results of operations accurately 
it is likely that in one or more future quarters  our operating results will fall below the expectation of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially and adversely affected 
the factors which will cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate include o the level of traffic on our website  o the overall demand for internet advertising and electronic commerce  o the addition or loss of advertisers and electronic commerce partners on our website  o overall usage and acceptance of the internet  o seasonal trends in advertising and electronic commerce sales and member usage  o capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  o the incurrence of costs relating to acquisitions  o the timing and profitability of acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances  and o competition from other providing services similar to those of ours 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising under short term contracts 
these contracts average one to three months in length 
as a result  our quarterly revenues and operating results are  to a significant extent  dependent on advertising revenues from contracts entered into within the quarter  and on our ability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters 
if the internet transitions from an emerging to a more developed form of media  these same patterns may develop in internet advertising sales 
internet advertising expenditures may also develop a different seasonality pattern 
traffic levels on our site and the internet have typically declined during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods 
in addition to selling advertising  an increasing portion of our revenues may be generated from electronic commerce through our shop 
theglobe 
com and chips bits  inc subsidiaries 
we also have existing electronic commerce arrangements with third parties for the sale of merchandise on our websites which are terminable upon short notice 
as a result  our revenues from electronic commerce may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the level of demand for products featured on our sites and overall competition in the marketplace 
we depend on our members for content and promotion 
we depend substantially upon member involvement for content and word of mouth promotion 
particularly  we depend upon the voluntary efforts of some highly motivated members who are most active in developing content to attract other internet users to our site 
this member involvement reduces the need for us to spend funds on content development and site promotion 
however  we cannot assure you that these members will continue to effectively generate significant content or promote our site 
our business may be materially and adversely affected if our most highly active members become dissatisfied with our services or our focus on the commercialization of those services or for any other reason stop generating content that effectively promotes our site 
our business model is new and unproven 
our business model is new and relatively unproven 
this model depends upon our ability to obtain more than one type of revenue source by using our community platform or games network 
to be successful  we must  among other things  develop and market products and services that achieve broad market acceptance by our users  advertisers and electronic commerce vendors 
we must continue to develop electronic commerce revenue streams by marketing products directly to users and having users purchase products through our site 
we cannot assure you that any internet community  including our site  will achieve broad market acceptance and to be able to generate significant electronic commerce revenues 
we also cannot assure you that our business model will be successful  that it will sustain revenue growth or that it will be profitable 
additionally  the market for our products and services is new  rapidly developing and characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
as is typical of most new and rapidly evolving markets  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are highly uncertain and risky 
moreover  because this market is new and rapidly evolving  we cannot predict our future growth rate  if any 
if this market fails to develop  develops slower than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if our products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
our acquisitions or joint ventures entail numerous risks and uncertainties 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition prospects or joint ventures that we expect to complement our existing business  increase our traffic  augment the distribution of our community  enhance our technological capabilities or increase our electronic commerce revenues 
on february   we acquired shop 
theglobe 
com  formerly known as azazz  to develop electronic commerce retailing on our site 
on april   we acquired attitude network  ltd 
to add two leading game enthusiast websites to our entertainment theme 
on november   we acquired the web hosting assets of webjump 
com to expand our home page hosting services 
on february   we acquired chips bits  inc  an electronic commerce retailer that focuses primarily on game enthusiasts and strategy plus  inc  an offline media property that publishes a monthly games magazine 
we consider and evaluate  from time to time  potential business combinations  either involving potential investments in our common stock or other business combinations or joint ventures  or our acquisition of other companies 
if consummated  any such transaction could result in a change of control of our company or could otherwise be material to our business or to your investment in our common stock 
we are currently in discussions or negotiations for various transactions of these types  some of which may be material  but we have not reached any binding agreements 
these transactions may or may not be consummated 
our future acquisitions or joint ventures could result in numerous risks and uncertainties  including o potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  which may be freely tradable in the public market or subject to registration rights which could require us to publicly register a large amount of common stock have a material adverse effect on our stock price  o large and immediate write offs  o the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  o difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired companies  o the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o the risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience such as electronic commerce retailing  o the risk that the acquired business will not perform as expected  and o risks associated with international expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in developing brand awareness  brand identity is critical to us 
we believe that establishing and maintaining awareness of theglobe 
com brand name  and the brand name of our wholly owned subsidiaries  is critical to attracting and expanding our member base  the traffic on our websites and our advertising and electronic commerce relationships 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brand or our brand value is diluted  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the importance of brand recognition will increase because low barriers to entry continue to result in an increased number of websites 
to promote our brand  we may be required to continue to increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness 
we may not generate a corresponding increase in revenues to justify these costs 
additionally  if members  other internet users  advertisers and customers do not perceive our community experience or games network to be of high quality  or if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by these parties  the value of our brand could be materially diluted 
we rely substantially on advertising revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of advertisements on our website 
we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december   and  advertising revenues represented  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our business model and revenues are highly dependent on the amount of traffic on our sites and our ability to properly monetize this traffic 
the level of traffic on our site determines the amount of advertising inventory we can sell 
our ability to generate significant advertising revenues depends  in part  on our ability to create new advertising programs without diluting the perceived value of our existing programs 
our ability to generate advertising revenues will also depend  in part  on the following o advertisers acceptance of the internet as an attractive and sustainable medium  o advertisers willingness to pay for advertising on the internet at current rates  o the development of a large base of users of our products and services  o our level of traffic  o the effective development of website content that attracts users having demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  and o price competition among websites 
we cannot assure you that the market for internet advertising will continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if the internet advertising market develops slower than we expect  our business performance would be materially adversely affected 
to date  substantially all our advertising contracts have been for terms averaging one to three months in length  with relatively few longer term advertising contracts 
additionally  our advertising customers may object to the placement of their advertisements on some members personal homepages  the content of which they deem undesirable 
for any of the foregoing reasons  we cannot assure you that our current advertisers will continue to purchase advertisements on our site 
we also compete with traditional advertising media  including television  radio  cable and print  for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
this results in significant pricing pressures on our advertising rates  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from internet companies that are early stage entities 
these entities are dependant on additional financing in order to survive 
for companies such as these  the risk of default on outstanding indebtedness to us may be higher than we anticipate 
we rely on third parties over whom we have limited control to manage the placement of advertising on our website 
the process of managing advertising within a large  high traffic website such as ours is an increasingly important and complex task 
we license our advertising management system from doubleclick  inc under an agreement expiring in october doubleclick may terminate the agreement upon days notice if we breach the agreement or doubleclick reasonably determines that we have used their advertising management system in a manner that could damage their technology or which reflects unfavorably on doubleclick s reputation 
no assurance can be given that doubleclick would not terminate the agreement 
any termination and replacement of doubleclick s service could disrupt our ability to manage our advertising operations 
additionally  we have entered into a contract with engage technologies  inc for the license of proprietary software to manage the placement of advertisements on our website 
this software has been implemented and our relationship under the contract has not yet been material 
there can be no assurance that this software will effectively manage the placement of advertisements on our website and that errors will not occur 
for example  doubleclick informed us in june that its method of reporting the numbers of unique visitors to the theglobe website was not accurate 
we cannot assure you that there will be no miscalculations of such or other measurements in the future 
any miscalculations or other problems with reporting these measurements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or stock price 
to the extent that we encounter system failures or material difficulties in the operation of our advertising management systems  we may o be unable to deliver banner advertisements and sponsorships through our site  and o be required to provide additional impressions to our advertisers after the contract term 
our obligations to provide additional impressions would displace saleable advertising inventory 
this would reduce revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we depend substantially on our key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and key technical personnel  all of whom have only worked together for a short time 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of our senior management team  especially our founders  our president and our chief financial officer 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  we are currently searching for a new chief executive officer 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in hiring a new chief executive officer 
we depend on highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our business plan requires us to increase our employee base over the next months 
competition for employees in our industry is intense 
we may be unable to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
wages for managerial and technical employees are increasing and are expected to continue to increase in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that our stock option plan will be considered attractive by industry standards 
if we are unable to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel necessary to support the growth of our business  our business would likely be materially and adversely affected 
we may not effectively manage our growth  our management team is inexperienced in the management of a large public company 
our recent growth has placed significant strains on our resources 
to manage our future growth  we must continue to implement and improve our operational systems and expand and train our employee base 
some of our key employees were hired during  including our president and chief operating officer  who joined us in august and our chief financial officer  who joined us in july in addition  our director of advertising sales  general counsel  general manager  director of communications and director of human resources each have been with us for less than three years 
furthermore  the members of our current senior management  other than the chairman  have not had any previous experience managing a public company or a large operating company 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that o we will be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations  o our key employees will be able to work together effectively as a team to successfully manage our growth  o we will be able to hire  train and manage our growing employee base  o our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations  and o our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for our products and services 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our chairman and vice president of corporate development have other interests and time commitments  we have conflicts of interest with some of our directors 
because our chairman and our vice president of corporate development are officers or employees of other companies  we will have to compete for their time 
michael s 
egan is our chairman 
mr 
egan serves as the chairman of our board of directors and as an executive officer with primary responsibility for day to day strategic planning and financing arrangements 
mr 
egan also is the controlling investor of dancing bear investments  an entity controlled by mr 
egan  which is our largest stockholder 
edward a 
cespedes is our vice president of corporate development with primary responsibility for corporate development opportunities including mergers and acquisitions 
mr 
cespedes also serves as a managing director of dancing bear investments 
messrs 
egan and cespedes have not committed to devote any specific percentage of their business time with us 
accordingly  we compete with dancing bear investments and messr 
egan s other related entities for their time 
mr 
egan was named chairman of anc rental corporation  a proposed spin off of the car rental business of autonation  inc we currently have revenue agreements with entities controlled by mr 
egan and by h 
wayne huizenga  one of our directors 
these agreements were not the result of arm s length negotiations  but we believe that the terms of these agreements are on comparable terms as if they were entered into with unaffiliated third parties 
the revenues recognized from such agreements represented less than and of total revenue for the years ended december  and due to their relationships with their related entities  messrs 
egan  cespedes and huizenga will have an inherent conflict of interest in making any decision related to transactions between their related entities and us 
we intend to review related party transactions in the future on a case by case basis 
we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other changes 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by o rapidly changing technology  o evolving industry standards  o frequent new service and product announcements  introductions and enhancements  and o changing consumer demands 
we may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes 
in addition  these market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the apparent need of companies from varying industries to offer internet based products and services 
as a result  our future success depends on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and standards 
we will also need to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services in response to competitive services and product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify our services or infrastructure and could fundamentally affect the nature of our business 
we have capacity constraint and system development risks 
a key element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of user traffic 
our ability to attract advertisers and to achieve market acceptance of our products and services and our reputation depend significantly upon the performance of our network infrastructure  including our servers  hardware and software 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness of our website could result in reduced traffic and reduced revenue  and could impair our reputation 
our websites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
our websites have in the past and may in the future experience slower response times for a variety of reasons  including system failures and an increase in the volume of user traffic on our websites 
accordingly  we face risks related to our ability to accommodate our expected customer levels while maintaining superior performance 
in addition  slower response time may damage our reputation and result in fewer users at our sites or users spending less time at our sites 
this would decrease the amount of inventory available for sale to advertisers 
accordingly  any failure of our servers and networking systems to handle current or higher volumes of traffic at sufficient response times would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we moved our principal servers to the new york teleport facility in staten island  new york under a lease with telehouse international corporation of america 
we maintain computer hardware  servers and operations relating to shop 
theglobe 
com in seattle  washington which are hosted by exodus communications  inc although exodus provides comprehensive facilities management services  including human and technical monitoring of all production servers hours per day  seven days per week  they do not guarantee that our internet access will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
our operations depend on the ability to protect our systems against damage from unexpected events  including fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failures and vandalism 
any disruption in our internet access could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems could also materially adversely affect our websites 
our reputation  theglobe 
com brand and the brands of our subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by any problems to our sites 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to our websites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
moreover  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
furthermore  we depend on hardware suppliers for prompt delivery  installation and service of equipment used to deliver our products and services 
any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business 
hackers may attempt to penetrate our security system  online security breaches could harm our business 
consumer and supplier confidence in our websites depends on maintaining relevant security features 
substantial or ongoing security breaches on our systems or other internet based systems could significantly harm our business 
we incur substantial expenses protecting against and remedying security breaches 
security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation 
experienced programmers or hackers have successfully penetrated our systems and we expect that these attempts will continue to occur from time to time 
because a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our products and services  we may have to expend significant capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate problems caused by these hackers 
additionally  we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
such security breaches could materially adversely affect our company 
in addition  the transmission of computer viruses resulting from hackers or otherwise could expose us to significant liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we have relationships 
competition for members  users and advertisers  as well as competition in the electronic commerce market is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
the market for members  users and internet advertising among websites is new and rapidly evolving 
competition for members  users and advertisers  as well as competition in the electronic commerce market  is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
barriers to entry are relatively insubstantial and we believe we will face competitive pressures from many additional companies both in the united states and abroad 
accordingly  pricing pressure on advertising rates will increase in the future which could have a material adverse effect on us 
all types of websites compete for users 
competitor websites include community sites and games information network  as well as gateway or portal sites and various other types of websites 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting users to a site are o functionality of the website  o brand recognition  o member affinity and loyalty  o broad demographic focus  o open access for visitors  o critical mass of users  particularly for community type sites  o attractiveness of content and services to users  and o pricing and customer service for electronic commerce sales 
we compete for users  advertisers and electronic commerce marketers with the following types of companies o other online community websites  such as geocities  which was acquired by yahoo  tripod and angelfire  subsidiaries of lycos  and xoom 
com which was acquired by nbc  o search engines and other internet portal companies  such as excite home  infoseek  which was acquired by the walt disney company  lycos and yahoo  o online content websites  such as cnet  espn 
com and zdnet 
com  o publishers and distributors of television  radio and print  such as cbs  nbc and cnn time warner  o general purpose consumer online services  such as america online and microsoft network  o websites maintained by internet service providers  such as at t worldnet  earthlink and mindspring  o electronic commerce websites  such as amazon 
com  etoys and cdnow  and o other websites serving game enthusiasts  including ziff davis gamespot and cnet s gamecenter 
many of our competitors  including other community sites  have announced that they are contemplating developing internet navigation services and are attempting to become gateway or portal sites through which users may enter the web 
in the event these companies develop successful portal sites  we could lose a substantial portion of our user traffic 
furthermore  many non community sites have been developing community aspects in their sites 
many of our existing and potential competitors  including companies operating web directories and search engines  and traditional media companies  have the following advantages o longer operating histories in the internet market  o greater name recognition  o larger customer bases  and o significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources in addition  providers of internet tools and services  including community type sites  may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies  such as microsoft and america online 
for example  excite merged with at home  america online acquired netscape and xoom 
com and snap 
com completed a transaction in which nbc merged some of its online assets with these entities to form nbci 
in addition  there has been other significant consolidation in the industry 
this consolidation may continue in the future 
we could face increased competition in the future from traditional media companies  including cable  newspaper  magazine  television and radio companies 
a number of these large traditional media companies  including walt disney co  cbs and nbc  have been active in internet related activities 
those competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services  adopt more aggressive advertising pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees  distribution partners  electronic commerce companies  advertisers  third party content providers and acquisition targets 
furthermore  our existing and potential competitors may develop sites that are equal or superior in quality to  or that achieve greater market acceptance than  our sites 
we cannot assure you that advertisers may not perceive our competitors sites as more desirable than ours 
to compete with other websites  we have developed and will continue to develop and introduce new features and functions  such as increased capabilities for user personalization and interactivity 
we also have developed and will continue to introduce new products and services  such as community tools and new content targeted for specific user groups with particular demographic and geographic characteristics 
these improvements will require us to spend significant funds and may require the development or licensing of increasingly complex technologies 
enhancements of or improvements to our websites may contain undetected programming errors that require significant design modifications  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and user support and a decrease in the value of our brand name 
our failure to effectively develop and produce new features  functions  products and services could affect our ability to compete with other websites 
this could have a material adverse effect on us 
web browsers offered by netscape and microsoft also increasingly incorporate prominent search buttons that direct traffic to services that compete with ours 
these features could make it more difficult for internet users to find and use our product and services 
in the future  netscape  microsoft and other browser suppliers may also more tightly integrate products and services similar to ours into their browsers or their browsers pre set home page 
additionally  entities that sponsor or maintain high traffic websites or that provide an initial point of entry for internet viewers  such as the regional bell operating companies  cable companies or internet service providers  such as microsoft and america online  offer and can be expected to consider further development  acquisition or licensing of internet search and navigation functions that compete with us 
these competitors could also take actions that make it more difficult for viewers to find and use our products and services 
additionally  the electronic commerce market is new and rapidly evolving  and we expect competition among electronic commerce merchants to increase significantly 
because the internet allows consumers to easily compare prices of similar products or services on competing websites and there are low barriers to entry for potential competitors  gross margins for electronic commerce transactions may narrow in the future 
many of the products that we sell on our website may be sold by the maker of the product directly or by other websites 
competition among internet retailers  our electronic commerce partners and product makers may have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues through electronic commerce transactions or from these electronic commerce partners 
we depend on the continued growth in the use and commercial viability of the web 
our market is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
our business is substantially dependent upon the continued rapid growth in the use of the internet and electronic commerce on the internet becoming more widespread 
commercial use of the internet is relatively new 
web usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security and authentication concerns with respect to transmission over the internet of confidential information  including credit card numbers  or other personal information  o ease of access  o inconsistent quality of service  o availability of cost effective  high speed service  and o bandwidth availability 
if the internet develops as a commercial medium more slowly than we expect  it will materially adversely affect our business 
additionally  if web usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth or its performance and reliability may decline 
websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future  web usage  as well as usage of our website  could grow more slowly or decline 
also  the internet s commercial viability may be significantly hampered due to o delays in the development or adoption of new operating and technical standards and performance improvements required to handle increased levels of activity  o increased government regulation  and o insufficient availability of telecommunications services which could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet 
we may be materially adversely affected if electronic commerce does not become a viable source of significant revenues or profits for the company 
in addition  our electronic commerce business may result in significant liability claims against us 
in february  we acquired shop 
theglobe 
com and in february we acquired chips bits  inc both of these entities are direct marketers of products over the internet 
however  we have limited experience in the sale of products online compared to our competitors and the development of relationships with manufacturers and suppliers of these products 
we also face many uncertainties which may affect our ability to generate electronic commerce revenues and profits  including o our ability to obtain new customers at a reasonable cost  retain existing customers and encourage repeat purchases  o the likelihood that both online and retail purchasing trends may rapidly change  o the level of product returns  o merchandise shipping costs and delivery times  o our ability to manage inventory levels  o our ability to secure and maintain relationships with vendors  o the possibility that our vendors may sell their products through other sites  and o intense competition for electronic commerce revenues  resulting in downward pressure on gross margins 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that electronic commerce transactions will provide a significant or sustainable source of revenues or profits 
additionally  due to the ability of consumers to easily compare prices of similar products or services on competing websites  gross margins for electronic commerce transactions which are narrower than for advertising businesses may further narrow in the future and  accordingly  our revenues and profits from electronic commerce arrangements may be materially negatively impacted 
if use of the internet for electronic commerce does not continue to grow  our business and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  consumers may sue us if any of the products that we sell are defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
some of our agreements with manufacturers contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not prevent all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
as a result  any claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
internet advertising may not prove as effective as traditional media 
the internet advertising market is new and rapidly evolving 
we cannot yet gauge its effectiveness as compared to traditional advertising media 
many of our current or potential advertising partners have little or no experience using the internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
advertisers that have traditionally relied upon other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the internet or find it less effective 
no standards have been widely accepted to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising or to measure the demographics of our user base 
additionally  no standards have been widely accepted to measure the number of members  unique users  page views or impressions related to a particular site 
we cannot assure you that any standards will become available in the future  that standards will accurately measure our users or the full range of user activity on our sites or that measurement services will accurately report our user activity based on their standards 
if standards do not develop  advertisers may not advertise on the internet 
in addition  we depend on third parties to provide these measurement services 
these measurements are often based on sampling techniques or other imprecise measures and may materially differ from each other and from our estimates 
we cannot assure you that advertisers will accept our or other parties measurements 
the rejection by advertisers of these measurements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the sale of internet advertising is subject to intense competition that has resulted in a wide variety of pricing models  rate quotes and advertising services 
for example  advertising rates may be based on the number of user requests for additional information made by clicking on the advertisement  known as click throughs  or on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to a user  known as impressions 
our contracts with advertisers typically guarantee the advertiser a minimum number of impressions 
to the extent that minimum impression levels are not achieved for any reason  including the failure to obtain the expected traffic  our contracts with advertisers may require us to provide additional impressions after the contract term  which may adversely affect the availability of our advertising inventory 
in addition  certain long term contracts with advertisers may be canceled if response rates or sales generated from our site are less than advertisers expectations 
this could have a material adverse effect on us 
our revenues could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to adapt to other pricing models for internet advertising if they are adopted 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  pricing models for internet advertising will emerge as the industry standard 
this makes it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
additionally  it is possible that internet access providers may  in the future  act to block or limit various types of advertising or direct solicitations  whether at their own behest or at the request of users 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
in addition  concern regarding the privacy of user data on the web may reduce the amount of user data collected in the future  thus reducing our ability to provide targeted advertisements 
this may  in turn  put downward pressure on cpm s 
we depend on third parties to increase traffic on our sites and to provide software and products 
we are dependent on various websites that provide direct links to our sites 
these websites may not attract significant numbers of users and we may not receive a significant number of additional users from these relationships 
we also enter into agreements with advertisers  electronic commerce marketers or other third party websites that require us to exclusively feature these parties in particular areas or on particular pages of our sites 
these exclusivity agreements may limit our ability to enter into other relationships 
our agreements with third party sites do not require future minimum commitments to use our services or provide access to our sites and may be terminated at the convenience of the other party 
moreover  we do not have agreements with a majority of the websites that provide links to our site 
these sites may terminate their links at any time 
many companies we may pursue for strategic relationships offer competing services 
as a result  these competitors may be reluctant to enter into strategic relationships with us 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we do not establish and maintain strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if any of our strategic relationships do not result in increased traffic on our websites 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain relationships with third parties that supply us with software or products that are crucial to our success  or that these software or products will be able to sustain any third party claims or rights against their use 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the software  services or products of those companies that provide access or links to our services or products will achieve market acceptance or commercial success 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our existing relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful service or product offerings or the generation of significant revenues for us 
we may need to raise additional funds  including  but not limited to  the issuance of debt 
we believe that the net proceeds from our secondary offering  together with our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for our existing business for the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in the future to acquire or operate any additional businesses  products or technologies or joint venture arrangements 
we expect that we will continue to experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future as a result of our operating losses and infrastructure needs 
accordingly  we may need to raise additional funds in a timely manner in order to o fund our anticipated expansion  o develop new or enhanced services or products  o respond to competitive pressures  o acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies  and o enter into joint ventures 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 
stockholders may experience additional dilution and these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we do not have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt 
any indebtedness could contain covenants which restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could be materially adversely effected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard substantial elements of our websites and underlying technology as proprietary and attempt to protect them by relying on intellectual property laws and restrictions on disclosure 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants 
in connection with our license agreements with third parties we generally seek to control access to and distribution of our technology and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
thus  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary information which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our intellectual property rights 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
in addition  we have filed a number of patent applications with the united states patent office 
however  effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our services are distributed or made available through the internet 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are also uncertain and still evolving 
we cannot assure you about the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us  including claims related to providing hyperlinks to websites operated by third parties or providing advertising on a keyword basis that links a specific search term entered by a user to the appearance of a particular advertisement 
moreover  from time to time  third parties may assert claims of alleged infringement by us or our members of their intellectual property rights 
see note of the consolidated financial statements and legal proceedings under item in part i in this form k 
any litigation claims or counterclaims could impair our business because they could o be time consuming  o result in costly litigation  o subject us to significant liability for damages  o result in invalidation of our proprietary rights  o divert management s attention  o cause product release delays  or o require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements that may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we license from third parties various technologies incorporated into our sites 
as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies  we may be required to license additional technology from others 
we cannot assure you that these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
additionally  we cannot assure you that the third parties from which we license our technology will be able to defend our proprietary rights successfully against claims of infringement 
as a result  our inability to obtain any of these technology licenses could result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new services or could adversely affect the performance of our existing services until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
we have registered several internet domain names including theglobe 
com  shop 
theglobe 
com  globelists 
com  tglo 
com  azazz 
com  happypuppy 
com  realmx 
com  kidsdomain 
com  gamesdomain 
com  webjump 
com and cdmag 
com 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries may change 
regulatory bodies could establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names  any or all of which may dilute the strength of our names 
we may not acquire or maintain our domain names in all of the countries in which our websites may be accessed  or for any or all of the top level domain names that may be introduced 
the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting proprietary rights is unclear 
therefore  we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
we may face increased government regulation and legal uncertainties in our industry 
there are an increasing number of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
in addition  a number of federal  state  local and foreign legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy and quality of products and services 
changes in tax laws relating to electronic commerce could materially effect our business and financial condition 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment and personal privacy is uncertain and developing 
any new legislation or regulation  or the application or interpretation of existing laws or regulations  may decrease the growth in the use of the internet  may impose additional burdens on electronic commerce or may alter how we do business 
this could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business  increase the costs of products sold through the internet or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are certain various issues being discussed by the accounting profession and the securities and exchange commission that would affect internet companies accounting policies with regards to revenue recognition  barter transactions  impression guarantees as they relate to advertising contracts  coupon and promotional expenses and customer acquisition costs 
while these discussions remain in the preliminary stages as of now  we cannot predict the impact that certain proposed changes would have on our results of operations  our financial condition or our stock price 
we may be exposed to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or for products sold over the internet 
users may access content on our websites or the websites of our distribution partners or other third parties through website links or other means  and they may download content and subsequently transmit this content to others over the internet 
this could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories  including defamation  obscenity  negligence  copyright  trademark infringement or the wrongful actions of third parties 
other theories may be brought based on the nature  publication and distribution of our content or based on errors or false or misleading information provided on our websites 
claims have been brought against online services in the past and we have received inquiries from third parties regarding these matters 
the claims could be material in the future 
we could also be exposed to liability for third party content posted by members on their personal web pages or by users in our chat rooms or on our bulletin boards 
additionally  we offer e mail service  which a third party provides 
the e mail service may expose us to potential liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail  lost or misdirected messages  fraudulent use of e mail or delays in e mail service 
we also enter into agreements with commerce partners and sponsors under which we are entitled to receive a share of any revenue from the purchase of goods and services through direct links from our sites 
after the shop 
theglobe 
com acquisition in february  we also began selling products directly to consumers 
we increase our electronic commerce capabilities through our acquisition of chips bits  inc those arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks  regulations by local  state  federal and foreign authorities and potential liabilities to consumers of these products and services  even if we do not ourselves provide these products or services 
we cannot assure you that any indemnification that may be provided to us in some of these agreements with these parties will be adequate 
even if these claims do not result in our liability  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims 
the imposition of potential liability for information carried on or disseminated through our systems could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to liability 
those measures may require the expenditure of substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our services 
additionally  our insurance policies may not cover all potential liabilities to which we are exposed 
we may have trouble expanding internationally 
a part of our strategy is to expand into foreign markets 
in april  we acquired attitude network  ltd  which operates games domain 
com  kids domain 
com and console domain 
com through a wholly owned uk subsidiary 
we have not previously operated internationally 
additionally  we may not be completely familiar with uk law and its ramifications on our business 
there can be no assurance that the internet or our community model will become widely accepted for advertising and electronic commerce in any international markets 
to expand overseas we intend to seek to acquire additional websites and enter into relationships with foreign business partners 
this strategy contains risks  including o we may experience difficulty in managing international operations because of distance  as well as language and cultural differences  o we or our future foreign business associates may not be able to successfully market and operate our services in foreign markets  o because of substantial anticipated competition  it will be necessary to implement our business strategy quickly in international markets to obtain a significant share of the market  and o we do not have the content or services necessary to substantially expand our operations in many foreign markets 
we will unlikely be able to significantly penetrate these markets unless we gain the relevant content  either through partnerships  other business arrangements or possibly acquisitions with content providers in these markets 
there are also risks inherent in doing business on an international level  including o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o trade barriers  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the introduction of the euro  o longer payment cycles in general  o problems in collecting accounts receivable  o difficulty in enforcing contracts  o political and economic instability  o seasonal reductions in business activity in certain other parts of the world  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
various stockholders  individually or in the aggregate  may control us 
michael s 
egan  our chairman  beneficially owns or controls  directly or indirectly   shares of our common stock which in the aggregate represents approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
todd v 
krizelman and stephen j 
paternot  our co chief executive officers  together  beneficially own of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  mr 
egan would likely be able to exercise significant influence in any stockholder vote  particularly if messrs 
krizelman and paternot support his position 
yale and christina brozen  the former owners of chips bits  inc and strategy plus  inc  beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock as tenants in the entirety 
messrs 
egan  krizelman  paternot and edward a 
cespedes and rosalie v 
arthur  each of whom is a director of our company  and we have entered into a stockholders agreement
