gross margins gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the gross margin variations are due to a number of variables in both segments as explained below 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal and fiscal increase over the previous years were due to the company s ability to maintain relatively constant profit margins of a major product line while the cost of the materials were decreasing 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of this product line increases and decreases 
the cost of this product is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
by maintaining relatively stable dollar margins  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
the company has also generally been able to  and expects to continue to  adjust its selling prices as the cost of materials and other expenses change  thereby maintaining relatively stable gross margins 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal gross margin was comparable to fiscal the fiscal increase over fiscal was due to a decrease in materials costs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively over the previous years

the company entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
most  but not all  of the claimants have now been paid under the settlement agreement 
the company s primary and umbrella insurers denied coverage and refused to defend the lawsuit 
during fiscal  the company prevailed in its claims against its insurers and has been reimbursed  for substantially all of its settlement and legal expenses 
in addition  the company anticipates that the defense and payment of the remaining claims  of approximately claimants  will be covered by the umbrella insurer

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company during the past three fiscal years  as selling prices have generally been adjusted as the cost of materials and other expenses have changed 
on occasion  however  slight fluctuations in the cost of a single  large volume product historically have not been reflected in the selling price of that product 
financial condition liquidity cash provided by operations in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to fluctuations in inventory values and to the recovery of litigation expenses in fiscal the increase in fiscal over was due primarily to a decrease in inventories caused by the decrease in the cost of a major product line and recovery of the litigation expenses 
cash and investments available for sale decreased by  to  at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures and the acquisition of st 
mary s chemicals 
the company is investing excess cash primarily in conservative investments 
cash equivalents consist of a money market account at a financial institution 
investments consist of investment contracts with high rated  stable insurance companies and marketable securities consisting of variable rate municipal bonds carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
investments are highly liquid and are available upon demand generally with only a minor penalty 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  the new red rock facility accounted for million  transportation equipment additions accounted for million  building improvements and additions amounted to million  and warehouse  laboratory and office machinery and equipment accounted for million 
common stock repurchases during fiscal  the company acquired and retired  shares of common stock for  during fiscal  the company acquired and retired  shares of common stock for  outlook management does not anticipate the need for stock or debt issuances in the short or long term  as cash  investments and cash flows from operations have been more than adequate to fund working capital  capital investments  dividend needs and common stock repurchases 
if the need for additional financing arises  however  management will consider issuance of debt or equity if such financing can be obtained on favorable terms 
although management continually looks for companies to acquire and for ways to modernize its facilities and equipment  no material commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures currently exist 
currently  management is aware of significant price increases in caustic soda caused by a reduction in the production of chlorine used in producing plastics 
the company cannot predict what the impact of this increased raw material cost will have on the fiscal financial performance of its industrial segment when the caustic soda supply is replenished upon the river shipping season opening in the spring 
however  based upon historical experience the company expects to be able to maintain its profit margin 
other than as discussed above  management is not aware of any matters or trends that have materially affected the results of operations for fiscal that are not expected to have either short or long term implications  nor is it aware of any trends or other matters that have not materially affected results in fiscal but are expected to have a material effect on future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at the end of fiscal  the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of  excluding  of those classified as cash and cash equivalents and variable rate securities
