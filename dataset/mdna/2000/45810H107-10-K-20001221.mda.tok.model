cost of revenue gross margin the company computes gross margin by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue 
included in cost of revenue are direct labor expenses  overhead charges associated with the company s direct labor base and other costs that can be directly related to specific contract cost objectives  such as travel  consultants  equipment  subcontracts  and other direct costs 
gross margins on contract revenues vary depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license revenues related to the sale of the company s cots products have the greatest gross margins because of the minimal associated marginal costs to produce 
by contrast  gross margins rates for equipment and subcontract pass throughs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margins typically range between and 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year on a consolidated basis  revenue decreased  or million  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease in revenue in fiscal year from fiscal year was principally due to a decrease in the company s equipment and subcontract revenue approximately million 
during fiscal year  the company continued to make progress in selling its epoch based ground systems to commercial clients while also making in roads selling epoch based systems to governmental clients  especially noaa  as us government customers increased their purchases of the company s epoch product line and related services for both command and control applications and for i t services 
during fiscal year  cost of revenue decreased to million from million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in direct equipment and subcontract costs which dropped million between fiscal year and fiscal year cost of revenue expressed as a percentage of revenues declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the company s gross margin decreased  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease was principally due to margin decreases in the company s equipment pass through component 
the gross margin decline for pass through revenue resulted from the shipment of million less pass through revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the service revenue margin would have been higher were it not for a one time unanticipated contract overrun that negatively impacted margins by almost  recorded during the fourth quarter of the current year 
despite the decline in gross margin dollars  gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to during fiscal year compared to for fiscal year selling  general administrative expenses sg a increased to approximately million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the change was primarily due to increases in the company s selling and marketing infrastructure costs combined with increased bid and proposal expenses

all prior period consolidated financial statements presented herein have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company and sat as a single entity 
certain reclassifications were made to the sat financial statements to conform to the company s presentations 
outlook this outlook section contains forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
there is no assurance that the company s projections will in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures which may occur in the future 
reference should be made to the various important factors listed under the heading forward looking statements and elsewhere herein that could cause actual future results to differ materially 
at this time  the company has a backlog of work to be performed and it may receive additional contract awards based on proposals in the pipeline 
management believes that operating results for future periods will improve based on the following assumptions 
demand for satellite technology and related products and services will continue to expand  and 
sales of its software products and engineering services will continue to increase 
currently  the company is estimating the results for the quarter ending december  to be comparable to the fourth quarter fiscal year results  not considering the effect of discontinued operations and the one time events described above 
looking forward to fiscal year in its entirety  the company is anticipating growth in revenue  operating income  net income  and fully diluted earnings per share excluding discontinued operations and the non recurring items  of    and respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since the company s inception in  it has been profitable on an annual basis and has generally financed its working capital needs through internally generated funds  supplemented by borrowings under the company s general line of credit facility with a commercial bank and the proceeds from the company s initial public offering in in june  the company supplemented its working capital position by raising approximately million net through the private placement of approximately million shares of its common stock 
in february  the company raised an additional million net for use in connection with potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes through the private placement of million additional shares of it common stock 
for fiscal year  the company generated approximately million of cash from operating activities  and used approximately million for investing activities  million of which was used to purchase short term  tax exempt marketable securities 
further  the company invested approximately million for newly capitalized software development costs 
during fiscal year  the company also purchased approximately million of fixed assets principally new computers and equipment 
during fiscal year  the company had access to a general line of credit facility through which it could borrow up to million for operating purposes and an additional line of credit with the bank amounting to million  which can be used for corporate acquisitions 
borrowings under the line are due on demand with interest at the london inter bank offering rate libor  plus a spread of to based on the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation ebita 
the lines of credit are secured by the company s billed and unbilled accounts receivable and have certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth and liquidity ratios 
the lines expire february  the company also has a line of credit with another bank for  this line expires on august  at september   and  the company had no amounts outstanding under the lines of credit 
the company s general line of credit facility prohibits the declaration or payment of dividends by the company until all of its obligations under the facility are paid in full or performed 
the company also has access to a million equipment lease line of credit under which it had   and  outstanding as of september    and  respectively 
the outstanding balance is payable over a month period and bears interest at a rate of per annum 
the company currently anticipates that its current cash balances  amounts available under its lease line of credit and a new line of credit and net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company believes that inflation did not have a material impact on the company s revenues or income from operations in fiscal years  and to date 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems  software products  and microprocessor dependent equipment are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  these date code fields must be able to accept four digit entries 
the company may realize exposure and risk if our suppliers or customers are not year compliant 
the potential areas of exposure include electronic data exchange systems operated by third parties with whom the company transacts business and products purchased from third parties  such as computers  software  telephone systems and other equipment used internally 
although the rollover from december  to january  has occurred  the company still faces risks to the extent that its suppliers of products  services  and systems or the suppliers of others with whom the company transacts business cannot provide the company with products  components  services  or systems that meet year requirements 
in the event that any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services  or systems that meet the year requirements  the company s business could be harmed

the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
while the company believes that these statements are and will be accurate  a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s statements 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and upon various conditions specific to its industry  and future trends cannot be predicted with certainty 
particular risks and uncertainties that may effect the company s business  in addition to those described elsewhere herein  include the following 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government  which are subject to termination without cause  government regulations and audits  competitive bidding  and the budget and funding process of the us government 

the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and their strategic response to the company s new services 

the potential obsolescence of the company s services due to the introduction of new technologies 

the response of customers to the company s marketing strategies and services 

the company s commercial contracts are subject to strict performance and other requirements 

the intense competition in the satellite ground system industry could harm our financial performance 

changes in activity levels in the company s core markets
