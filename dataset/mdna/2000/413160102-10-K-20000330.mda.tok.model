item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and markets digital fiber optic systems for delivering video  voice and data services over cable  satellite and wireless networks 
almost all of our sales have been derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
with the introduction of our transend digital headend products in and the subsequent purchase of new media communication ltd  we have broadened our product offering to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks in addition to cable systems 
on october  the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with c cube microsystems  inc c cube  pursuant to which c cube will merge into harmonic the merger agreement 
under the terms of the merger agreement  c cube will sell or spin off to its shareholders all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor business prior to closing 
c cube will then merge into harmonic and  as a result  harmonic will acquire c cube s divicom business 
the divicom business designs  manufactures and sells products and systems that enable companies to deliver digital video  audio and data over a variety of networks including satellite  wireless  telephone and cable 
the merger will be structured as a tax free exchange of stock and will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in the merger  each share of common stock of c cube will be converted into the right to receive 
shares of harmonic common stock 
approximately million shares of harmonic common stock will be issued and the purchase price including acquisition related costs is expected to be approximately billion 
consummation of the merger is subject to a number of conditions  including harmonic and c cube shareholder approval  the prior disposition of c cube s semiconductor business and regulatory approvals 
the shareholder meetings are scheduled to be held on april to date  a substantial majority of harmonic s net sales have been to relatively few customers  and harmonic expects this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  sales to at t accounted for of net sales compared to in in addition  in sales to a chinese distributor accounted for of net sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
international sales are made primarily to distributors  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
in  and  sales of optical transmitters accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales and sales of optical node receivers  return path and network management products accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
in and  transend and cyberstream digital products accounted for and of net sales 
there were no significant sales of digital products in harmonic recognizes revenue upon shipment of products except when probability of collection is not assured or contract provisions require customer acceptance 
harmonic does not provide for rights of return to end users or distributors 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized and adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
to date  gross margins on sales of optical transmitter products have been higher than sales of receiver and return path products 
in addition  sales made to customers outside of the united states have generally carried higher gross margins 
harmonic often recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected levels of future sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on operating results may be magnified by harmonic s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of these and other factors  harmonic s operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
see risk factors our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
results of operations harmonic s historical consolidated statements of operations data for each of the three years ended december   and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired in process technology total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net sales the company s net sales increased to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher unit sales of metrolink dwdm systems and pwrblazer scaleable nodes  which began volume shipment during the middle of  and  to a lesser extent  higher unit sales of existing products partially offset by lower selling prices 
the increase was also attributable to increased spending by domestic and international customers 
during domestic sales increased by  principally due to increased shipments to at t 
at t represented of net sales during compared to of net sales in international sales increased during compared to  primarily due to higher shipments to canada and the united kingdom 
international sales represented of net sales in compared to in net sales increased by to million in  from to million in this growth in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of new products  including transend digital headend products  metrolink dwdm systems and pwrblazer scaleable nodes  which began volume shipment during the middle of  as well as to an increase in spending by domestic customers in the second half of during domestic sales increased by  principally due to increased shipments to at t  while international sales decreased by due to continued weakness in many international markets 
while the increase in net sales was also due to nominally higher unit sales of existing products  generally lower selling prices in the industry resulted in an approximate ten percent decrease in existing product sales 
gross profit gross profit increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in gross profit and gross margin were principally due to higher unit volumes  which allowed the company to improve fixed cost absorption and realize increased economies of scale through higher production and purchasing volumes  as well as a more favorable product mix  which included a higher percentage of transmitters 
gross profit decreased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decreases in gross profit and gross margin were principally due to a lower percentage of international sales resulting from reduced demand  a less favorable product mix  which included a lower percentage of transmitters  and pricing pressure for certain products due to increased competition 
in addition  gross profit and gross margin were negatively impacted by start up costs associated with new product introductions and an increase of million in inventory reserves for existing products following the introduction of new products 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the increase in absolute spending was principally attributable to higher headcount  consulting expenses and prototype expenses 
these increases were partially offset by higher amounts of government grants earned in israel  which are netted against research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally attributable to increased net sales 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in research and development expenses in in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased headcount  particularly at harmonic s subsidiary in caesarea  israel  which develops harmonic s transend digital headend products  and to the inclusion of nmc s research and development expenses starting in january research and development expenses for  and are net of grants of approximately   and  respectively 
harmonic anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to higher headcount and costs associated with expansion of the sales and marketing organizations to provide wider geographic coverage and support for new products  as well as higher sales commissions related to increased net sales 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally attributable to increased net sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to higher headcount and costs associated with expansion and reorganization of the direct sales force  technical support and marketing organizations  particularly to support the introduction of new products 
this increase included expenses incurred in connection with the recruiting and staffing for new international sales and technical support centers 
in addition  higher promotional expenses and the inclusion of nmc s sales and marketing expenses starting in january contributed to the increase 
harmonic expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars in was principally due to increased personnel  consulting and recruiting expenses associated with supporting the company s overall growth in headcount and operations 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to increased net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to the inclusion of nmc s expenses starting in january  as well as costs of supporting harmonic s growth in overall headcount  and the establishment of international sales and support offices 
harmonic expects to incur higher levels of general and administrative expenses in the future  although such expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
acquired in process technology on january   harmonic acquired nmc  a privately held israeli development stage company with employees  for million in a stock for stock transaction 
harmonic also assumed all outstanding stock options of nmc 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the fair value of the assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair value at the time of the transaction 
harmonic determined that technological feasibility of the acquired in process technology had not yet been established 
harmonic also believed that nmc s existing technology would generate no further revenue on account of its obsolescence 
accordingly  no value was assigned to the existing technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  harmonic wrote off acquired in process research and development expenses of million as a one time charge to operations in the first quarter of historically  nmc had developed receiver cards for data transmission over cable  wireless and satellite networks 
these analog products operated at transmission speeds of mbps and had been sold only to a limited number of customers 
nmc concluded during that these analog products were rapidly becoming obsolete and discontinued research and development efforts 
based on customer feedback and expected market trends  nmc commenced technology development of the cyberstream system  a digital system designed to provide substantially increased transmission speeds of mbps to mbps and to incorporate differentiated service capabilities and sophisticated network management 
at the time of the nmc acquisition  the cyberstream system was nmc s only research and development project in process 
the cyberstream system was comprised of a data gateway at the satellite uplink or cable headend  network management and control features at the headend  and a receiver card for installation in a personal computer or a local area network router device 
just prior to the acquisition  nmc had initiated production of a limited number of prototype receiver cards in order to participate in pilot trials with two prospective customers 
shipment of the prototype cards commenced at the end of harmonic determined that since these products were intended for deployment in networks with large numbers of subscribers  nmc would have to engage in ongoing trials over an extended period to determine the products technological feasibility 
as part of these trials  nmc also shipped initial versions of operating software  but was several months away from completion of critical elements of the cyberstream system  such as quality of service  simple network management protocol and porting of the software to the windows and nt platforms 
subsequent to the acquisition  harmonic expended million in in research and development costs to accelerate development and to incorporate changes resulting from field trial evaluations 
to estimate the value of nmc s existing and in process technology  the total income forecasted was allocated to existing  in process and future technology based on the products scheduled release dates and expected lives 
no value was ascribed to existing technology due to its obsolescence nor to future technology that was not in development at the date of acquisition 
the forecasts assumed timely release of the products as anticipated by harmonic and that nmc would utilize harmonic distribution channels 
estimated revenues for the purchased in process products were assumed to commence by the middle of fiscal year and increase through fiscal year  at which time they were assumed to decrease through fiscal year  as newer products would be released 
rapid change and improvements in technology characterize the high speed data delivery market 
harmonic s future success will depend on its ability to achieve scientific and technological advances and to translate such advances into commercially competitive products on a timely basis that keep pace with competing technological developments and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consisting principally of interest income  was million in  million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments  following the closing of the company s public offering of common stock in april the decrease in was due primarily to lower interest income on lower average cash and cash equivalents balances 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for was based on an estimated annual tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for due to the net loss incurred 
the provision for income taxes for was based on an estimated annual tax rate of resulting from federal and state alternative minimum taxes and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company expects to have an effective annual tax rate that approximates statutory rates in year and beyond on income before amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the c cube merger 
see risk factors if the c cube merger is completed  we will record substantial goodwill and other intangible assets and report substantial net losses 
liquidity and capital resources in april the company completed a public offering of its common stock  raising approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
the company also received million from exercise of a warrant 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
cash provided by operations was million in compared to cash used in operations of million in the increase in cash provided by operations in was primarily due to net income in compared to a net loss in  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other assets 
the company has a bank line of credit facility which provides for borrowings up to million with a million equipment term loan sub limit and expires in july borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate prime rate plus under the term loan and are payable monthly 
the company has letters of credit issued under the line of million which expire at various dates throughout year there were no outstanding borrowings at december  and under the line 
additions to property  plant and equipment were approximately million during compared to million in the increase in was due principally to higher expenditures for manufacturing and test equipment associated with expansion of production capacity 
while harmonic currently has no material commitments  it expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  primarily for manufacturing and test equipment 
if the c cube merger is completed  the company expects to spend substantially more on capital expenditures  but as of this date is unable to quantify the amount 
the company believes that its existing liquidity sources  including its bank line of credit facility  and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months if the c cube merger were not to be completed 
however  the company expects the merger to be completed  and believes that its existing liquidity sources  cash of million to be received pursuant to the merger agreement and cash to be received for the estimated tax liability related to the spin off of the semi conductor business will satisfy the cash requirements of the combined company for at least the next twelve months 
see risk factors we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds in terms acceptable to us 
year disclosure thus far  the company has not experienced any significant problems related to year issues associated with products under development or released  or with the company s internal computer systems 
however  the company cannot guarantee that the year problem will not adversely affect its business  operating results or financial condition at some point in the future 
factors that may effect future results of operations our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of customer orders  competitive market conditions  our unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products  the level of international sales  and economic conditions specific to the cable television industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
we depend on cable industry capital spending for substantially all of our revenue 
almost all of our sales have been derived  directly or indirectly  from sales to cable television operators and we expect these sales to constitute a substantial majority for the foreseeable future 
demand for our products depends to a significant extent upon the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators for constructing  rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the capital spending patterns of cable television operators are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  cable television operators annual budget cycles  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for cable television services and the acceptance of new broadband services  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative video delivery technologies such as satellite broadcasting  and discretionary customer spending patterns and general economic conditions 
our net sales in the second half of and the first quarter of were negatively affected by a slow down in spending by cable television operators in the us and in foreign markets 
the factors contributing to this slow down in capital spending included consolidation and system exchanges by our domestic cable customers  which generally have had the initial effect of delaying certain system upgrades  uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on marketing and customer service strategies by some international cable television operators instead of construction of networks  and general economic conditions in international markets 
while our net sales increased during the last seven quarters from the level achieved in the first quarter of due to increased spending in the north american cable television industry  spending by cable television operators outside of north america generally remained weak 
while net sales outside of north america increased during the third and fourth quarters of compared to the first quarter of we cannot predict if cable television spending outside of north america will continue to grow or whether cable television spending in north america will continue to increase 
in addition  cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
historically  a significant majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
due in part to the consolidation of ownership of domestic cable television systems  we expect that sales to at t and relatively few other customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to at t accounted for of our net sales compared to in in addition  in sales to a chinese distributor accounted for of our net sales 
almost all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
while our international sales are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we do not currently engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
further  we cannot assure you that foreign markets will continue to develop 
in recent years  certain asian and latin american currencies have devalued significantly in relation to the us dollar 
we believe that financial developments in asia and latin america were a major factor contributing to lower international net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  the uncertain financial situation in asia has placed financial pressure on some of our distributors 
in response  we increased accounts receivable reserves in the first quarter of we are continuing to evaluate the effect on our business of recent financial developments in asia and latin america 
given the current economic uncertainties in china and throughout asia  we cannot assure you that shipment of orders to asia  including china  will be made as scheduled  or at all 
we cannot assure you that our sales and collection cycles in asia and latin america will not continue to be harmed by the uncertain financial climate 
in particular  we cannot predict the effect on our business  if any  of recent political tensions between the us and china 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
in the past  however  we have received such indications but  on occasion  we did not ultimately receive purchase orders for our products 
we must be able to effectively manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting potential demand for our products 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we expend resources and purchase materials to manufacture products and such products are not purchased  our business and operating results could suffer 
the market in which we operate is intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the market for cable television transmission equipment is extremely competitive and has been characterized by rapid technological change 
harmonic s current competitors include significantly larger corporations such as adc telecommunications  antec a company owned in part by at t  general instrument which was recently acquired by motorola  philips and scientific atlanta 
additional competition could come from new entrants in the broadband communications equipment market  such as lucent technologies and cisco systems 
most of these companies are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by cable television operators 
in addition  many of our competitors have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign cable television operators than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competition will not harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard or if any of our smaller competitors were to enter into or expand relationships with larger companies through mergers  acquisitions or otherwise  our business could be seriously harmed 
further  our competitors may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature and characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rate  size and technological direction 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products 
moreover  these products may not achieve broad commercial acceptance and may have lower gross margins than our other products 
in addition  to successfully develop and market our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to effectively manage our growth 
the growth in harmonic s business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on harmonic s personnel  management and other resources 
harmonic s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require us to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
if we fail to manage our future growth effectively  our business could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
competition for qualified technical and other personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area and israel  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
our acquisition of nmc has created numerous risks and challenges for us 
the acquisition of new media communication ltd  or nmc  which changed its name during to harmonic data systems ltd  or hds  has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
the acquisition of nmc in january has allowed us to develop and expand our product offerings to include broadband high speed data delivery hardware and software and increased the scope of our international operations in israel 
the acquisition of nmc continues to impose challenges  including the dependence on the evolution and growth of the market for wireless and satellite broadband services  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  research and development efforts  products  personnel and cultures of harmonic and nmc  our ability to successfully develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance of the products of nmc  and the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of nmc 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these challenges  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions 
we have made and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
our failure to complete the c cube merger may adversely affect our business 
the merger agreement with c cube contains conditions which we and or c cube must meet prior to the consummation of the merger  including harmonic stockholder approval of the merger  c cube stockholder approval of the merger  neither harmonic nor c cube having experienced any material adverse change in its business  neither harmonic nor c cube having materially breached any of its representations  warranties or covenants in the merger agreement  c cube having effected a sale or spin off of its semiconductor division  and there being no law or court order prohibiting the merger 
in the event that the merger is not completed the market price for our common stock could decline 
in addition  pursuant to section of the merger agreement  the merger agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances 
each of harmonic and c cube has agreed that if the merger is not consummated as a result of certain specified events  it will pay to the other party a termination fee of million 
payment of the fees described in this paragraph are not in lieu of damages incurred in the event of willful breach of the merger agreement 
if the merger is not consummated  legal  accounting and financial advisory fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with the proposed combination  in addition to the consummation and implementation of the merger and possible break up fees described above  could materially and adversely affect harmonic s operating results 
there are numerous risks associated with the c cube merger including those identified in this report 
for a more complete discussion of risks we face  we urge you to read the risks set forth in the joint proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on march  if the c cube merger is completed  we will record substantial goodwill and other intangible assets and report substantial net losses 
goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately billion are expected to be recorded in connection with the merger as disclosed in the pro forma financial data presented in the joint proxy statement 
while the purchase price allocation has not been finalized  goodwill and intangibles are expected to be amortized over approximately years  and such amortization is expected to result in substantial net losses as a result of the noncash charges commencing in the year the amortization of goodwill and intangibles are not deductible for tax purposes which will result in a provision for income taxes despite a substantial reported net loss 
we will be liable for c cube microsystems pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
we believe that the spin off of the semiconductor business will give rise to a significant tax liability which would be approximately million based on an assumed valuation of the semiconductor business of million 
the actual tax liability may differ significantly from the estimate based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the spin off 
for example  the value of the stock of the spun off semiconductor business will likely fluctuate and if such value at the time of the spin off exceeds the assumed value  the actual tax liability will exceed the estimated tax liability 
under state law  harmonic generally will become liable for all of c cube microsystems debts  including c cube microsystems liability for taxes resulting from the spin off 
c cube microsystems is required to retain and transfer to harmonic in the merger an amount of cash sufficient to pay this liability as well as all other tax liabilities of c cube microsystems and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the merger 
harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube microsystems tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on harmonic 
due to the structure of the merger transaction  harmonic will be liable for c cube microsystems general pre merger liabilities and any liabilities relating to c cube microsystems semiconductor business for which the spun off semiconductor business is unable to indemnify harmonic 
the merger of c cube microsystems into harmonic  with harmonic as the surviving entity  will result in harmonic assuming all of the liabilities of c cube microsystems at the time of the merger 
pursuant to the merger agreement  harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business for liabilities associated with c cube microsystems historic semiconductor business 
however  if the spun off semiconductor business is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligations to harmonic or if general liability claims not specifically associated with c cube microsystems historic semiconductor business are asserted after the merger  we would have to assume such obligations 
those obligations could have a material adverse effect on harmonic 
if the c cube merger is completed  we may experience difficulties integrating the divicom business of c cube 
in addition to the risks generally associated with acquisitions  there are a number of significant risks directly associated with our proposed merger with c cube 
in particular  the successful combination of harmonic and c cube will require substantial attention from management 
the anticipated benefits of the merger will not be achieved unless the operations of the divicom business of c cube are successfully combined with those of harmonic in a timely manner 
the difficulties of assimilation may be increased by the need to integrate disparate information systems and personnel into a combined corporation and by harmonic s limited personnel  management and other resources 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require integration of the companies product offerings and the coordination of their research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of either or both of the companies businesses and certain customers may defer purchasing decisions 
the diversion of the attention of management from the day to day operations of the combined company  or difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process  could also materially and adversely affect the business  financial condition and operating results of the combined company 
in addition  the success of the combined company depends  in part  on the retention and integration of key management  technical  marketing  sales and customer support personnel of the divicom business of c cube 
the success of the combined company will depend upon the retention of these key employees during the transitional period following the merger 
harmonic can offer no assurance that such key employees will remain with the combined company prior to or for any period after the proposed merger especially as competition for qualified technical and other personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
the loss of such services would adversely affect the combined company s combined business and operating results 
if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable and other network operators  delays associated with cable and other network operators internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or services within broadband networks  and testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property right owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property right will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business and operating results 
in order to successfully develop and market our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into such technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
as is common in our industry  we have from time to time received notification from other companies of intellectual property rights held by those companies upon which our products may infringe 
any claim or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly  time consuming and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could harm our business 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material  and could be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes 
although holders of patents and other intellectual property rights often offer licenses to their patent or other intellectual property rights  we cannot assure you that licenses would be offered  that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to us or that failure to obtain a license would not cause our operating results to suffer 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash balances and available line of credit and cash flow expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
if the c cube merger is consummated  we believe that our existing liquidity sources  cash of million to be received pursuant to the merger agreement  cash to be received for the estimated tax liability related to the spin off of the semiconductor business  our bank line of credit facility and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy the cash requirements of the combined company for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
in addition  we expect to review other potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities 
while we have no other current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any potential acquisition  any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital 
funds may not be available at the time or times needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increasing reliance on subcontractors involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have been recently in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend considerable efforts to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry including the proposed acquisition of etek dynamics by jds uniphase and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
certain key elements of our digital headend products are provided by a sole foreign supplier 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we may be subject to an increasing risk of inventory obsolescence in the future  which could harm our business 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains two facilities in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees 
the personnel at these facilities represent a significant portion of our research and development operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm our business 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
our business could be adversely impacted by year issues 
thus far  we have not experienced any significant problems related to year issues associated with products under development or released  or with our internal computer systems 
however  we can not guarantee that the year problem will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition at some point in the future 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the offering price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
see market for the registrant s common stock and related security holder matters 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries in israel and in the united kingdom 
harmonic has not engaged in hedging activities as of december  and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rates harmonic has subsidiaries in israel and the united kingdom whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results  fair values or cash flows  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of the israeli shekel or british pound would not harm harmonic s financial condition and results of operations 
interest rates changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of the analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition for the year
