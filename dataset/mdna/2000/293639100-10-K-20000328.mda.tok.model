item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
in fiscal  we generated of our gross revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network advertising and rental income from tower sites 
we include revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations in net revenues  while we reflect operating expenses associated with these stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a station owned and operated by us 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase listenership and arbitron ratings 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any increased ratings and therefore increased advertising revenues tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
we calculate same station growth by comparing the performance of stations operated by us throughout a relevant period to the performance of those same stations whether or not operated by us in the prior year s corresponding period  excluding the effect of barter revenues and expenses and discontinued operations and averaging those growth rates for the period presented 
same station broadcast cash flow margin is the broadcast cash flow margin of the stations included in our same station calculations 
for purposes of the following discussion  pro forma net income represents historical income before income taxes and extraordinary item adjusted as if we were treated as a c corporation during all relevant periods at an effective tax rate of  applied to income before income taxes and extraordinary item and the effect of the adjustment to reflect indexing of the convertible subordinated note the amount of this adjustment is not tax deductible  and excluding extraordinary item  net of pro forma taxes 
results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

we determined the adjustment to reflect indexing of the convertible subordinated note as of the end of each relevant period by subtracting the sum of principal and accrued interest on the note from the fair value of the shares of our common stock into which the note was convertible using multiples of broadcast cash flow of comparable publicly held radio broadcast companies 
the adjustment to reflect indexing of the note was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively

we do not expect such significant gains on the sale of assets to continue in the future 
extraordinary item  net of taxes the extraordinary item for the year ended september  resulted from the write off of million million  net of taxes of unamortized finance charges due to the early extinguishment of debt

this compares to pro forma net income of million for the year ended september   which included the impact of the recognition of million for the adjustment to reflect indexing of the convertible subordinated note  offset by a gain of million  net of taxes  on the sale of assets 
the decrease is primarily attributable to our disposition of stations in the houston  san francisco and pittsburgh radio markets during the year ended september  we used the proceeds from these dispositions to acquire stations in markets where we believed there was greater potential for establishing market leading station clusters 
year ended september  dollar amounts in thousands broadcast cash flow   increase of  or as a result of factors described above broadcast cash flow increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  on a same station basis  broadcast cash flow increase to million from million 
year ended september  dollar amounts in thousands broadcast cash flow margin decrease of our broadcast cash flow margin declined to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to our exchange in of relatively mature stations in san francisco and houston  which operated at higher broadcast flow margins but were located in markets where management believed there were limited growth and clustering opportunities  for less developed properties in seattle  kansas city and sacramento 
the less developed properties collectively operated with lower broadcast cash flow margins but offered stronger growth and clustering opportunities 
on a same station basis  broadcast cash flow margin increased to from 
year ended september  dollar amounts in thousands pro forma after tax cash flow   increase of  or pro forma after tax cash flow increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase is attributable to improved operations of existing stations and the net effect of newly acquired properties  taking into consideration pro forma income taxes as though we had reported as a c corporation 
liquidity and capital resources we use a significant portion of our capital resources to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our bank facility  which is described below  the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  and internally generated cash flow 
net cash flows from operating activities were million and million for the year ended december  and for the twelve months ended december   respectively 
changes in our net cash flows from operating activities are primarily a result of changes in advertising revenues and station operating expenses  which are affected by the acquisition and disposition of stations during those periods 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million and million for the year ended december  and for the twelve months ended december   respectively 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million and million for the year ended december  and for the twelve months ended december   respectively 
the cash flows for the year ended december  reflect acquisitions consummated along with the related borrowings  proceeds from our initial public offering  our october class a common stock and tides offerings and the related payment of long term debt  and the distribution to our s corporation shareholders of million 
the cash flows for the twelve months ended december  reflect refinancing as a result of our bank facility  acquisitions along with the related borrowings  and divestitures 
on february   upon the consummation of our initial public offering  we received net proceeds of million  after deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions 
we used these proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our former credit facility and to pay other corporate obligations 
shortly after reducing indebtedness under our former credit facility  in february we borrowed approximately million to purchase three boston radio stations from cbs 
on october   we completed our class a common stock and tides offerings and received million and million in proceeds  respectively  after deduction of discounts  commissions  fees and expenses 
the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under our bank facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit in the amounts of million and million 
we used the net proceeds from our october class a common stock offering and the tides offering  together with cash on hand and proceeds from our bank facility  to finance the million in cash to consummate the purchase of stations from sinclair on december  in connection with the sinclair acquisition we have also agreed to purchase million of advertising time on television stations owned and or programmed by sinclair and its affiliates at prevailing rates over the next five years 
in addition to debt service and quarterly distributions under the tides  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and  if appropriate opportunities arise  acquisitions of additional radio stations 
for fiscal year  we estimate that capital expenditures will be between million and million 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with available revolving and term credit borrowings under our bank facility  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations 
however  we may require additional financing for future acquisitions  if any  and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on terms considered to be favorable to us 
further  if sinclair rightfully terminates the asset purchase agreement for the four kansas city stations  sinclair may be entitled to receive liquidated damages from us in the maximum amount of approximately million 
in addition  on february  days after public notice that the applications for consent to assignment of the kansas city station licenses had been accepted for filing by the fcc  the purchase price for the kansas city stations increased approximately million and will continue to increase at the end of each day period thereafter for so long as the kansas city market has not closed due to the failure to receive any required regulatory consent as a result of facts relating to us or our affiliates 
upon closing the sinclair acquisition on december   our effective tax rate increased from to as a result of adding facilities in additional states which on average have higher income tax rates than in those states in which we currently operate 
we also recorded a non cash deferred income tax expense of approximately million to reflect the increase in the effective tax rate and its effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
we entered into our bank facility  dated as of december   with a syndicate of banks for senior secured credit in the amount of million 
the bank facility consists of a million reducing revolving credit facility  and a million multi draw term loan 
the bank facility was established to fund corporate acquisitions  refinance our existing indebtedness  and provide working capital 
at our election  interest on any outstanding principal accrues at a rate based on either libor plus a spread which ranges from to or on keybank na s base rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
although we may borrow  repay and re borrow under the revolving credit facility  the aggregate maximum amount that we can have outstanding at any one time is reduced on a quarterly basis beginning on september  the multi draw term loan must be fully drawn by september  and principal is reduced on a quarterly basis beginning on september  the final maturity date for the bank facility is september  under the bank facility  at any time prior to december   we may solicit incremental loans up to million  and will be governed under the same terms as the multi draw term loan 
however  there can be no guarantee that  upon request  we will receive commitments for any of the incremental loans 
the bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios 
we believe we are in compliance with these covenants and ratios 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under the bank facility along with outstanding letters of credit in the amounts of million and million 
we expect to use the credit available under the revolving credit facility and multi draw term loan to fund the purchase of the remaining assets under the sinclair acquisition  including the four kansas city stations and pending and future acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  which are collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
which extends the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
we have not completed a full evaluation of the applicability of sfas no 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
although the exact impact is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations 
impact of year issues we rely  directly and indirectly  on information technology systems to operate our radio stations  provide our radio stations with up to date news and perform a variety of administrative services including accounting  financial reporting  advertiser spot scheduling  payroll and invoicing 
we also use non information technology systems  such as microchips for dating and other automated functions 
all of these technology systems could have been affected by year issues 
based upon our experience to date  we estimate that the impact of the year was minimal and has had no material effect on our operations and any remaining costs to respond to the year issues will not be material 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ significantly 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following integrating acquisitions is difficult 
we have acquired or agreed to acquire radio stations since october   and we expect to make acquisitions of other stations and station groups in the future 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future  including the operations  systems or management that we acquired in the sinclair acquisition 
our consummation of the sinclair acquisition requires us to manage a significantly larger radio station portfolio than historically has been the case 
our failure to integrate and manage newly acquired stations successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions  including the acquisition of the sinclair stations in the kansas city market  will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our acquisition of the sinclair stations in kansas city is  and many of our future acquisitions may be  subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
on september   we received a second request from the department of justice with respect to the sinclair kansas city acquisition 
although we believe that the concerns of the department of justice will be resolved by our disposition of three stations in the kansas city market that we are required to make in order to comply with fcc rules  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of the acquisition of the sinclair stations in the kansas city market or other attractive acquisition opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or consummating these acquisitions or what the consequences of any acquisitions will be 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including the following satellite delivered audio radio service  which could result in the introduction of new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and microbroadcasting stations low powered  limited coverage radio stations  about which the fcc is accepting proposals 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million and shareholders equity of million 
in addition to our obligations on our long term indebtedness  we have quarterly interest obligations on the debentures held by the trust that fund distributions on the tides 
these obligations are substantial in amount and could have a substantial impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
moreover  we may borrow up to an additional million under our existing bank facility 
in addition  at any time prior to december   we may solicit incremental loans up to million 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our bank facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations which might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and all of our station operating subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio s obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis 
our obligations on the tides  which were purchased by the trust that sells the tides  are subordinated to our obligations on this guarantee 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  is distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot assure you that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our credit facility  would permit such dividends or distributions 
we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  priorities of advertisers  fluctuations in operating costs  technological changes and innovations  changes in labor conditions  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the united states department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
dependence on seattle radio stations 
the radio stations we own or operate in seattle generated approximately of our net revenues and approximately of our broadcast cash flow for the fiscal year ended december  on a pro forma basis as if the sinclair acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the period  the radio stations we own or operate in seattle would have generated approximately of our net revenues and approximately of our broadcast cash flow for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly we have greater exposure to any operating difficulties that may arise at our seattle stations or to adverse events or conditions that affect the seattle economy than if we were more geographically diverse 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer effectively controls our company  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us

we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
for example  in connection with the sinclair kansas city acquisition we are required to dispose of three radio stations in kansas city  and the timing and terms of these dispositions are both unknown 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives  including joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
field  our president and chief operating officer  john c 
donlevie  esq  our executive vice president  secretary and general counsel  and stephen f 
fisher  our senior vice president and chief financial officer 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our bank facility requires us to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
as a result  we have entered into various interest rate transactions with various banks  which we call the rate hedging transactions  designed to mitigate our exposure to significantly higher floating interest rates 
a rate cap agreement establishes an upper limit or cap for the base libor rate and a rate floor agreement establishes a lower limit or floor for the base libor rate 
agreements covering a rate cap and a rate floor have been entered into simultaneously with the same bank 
an agreement for a cap  which was entered into without a rate floor agreement  provides an upper limit for the base libor rate 
swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of march  we have rate hedging transactions in place for a total notional amount of million 
all of the rate hedging transactions are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
an increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation of each of the rate hedging transactions 
correspondingly  a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation of each of the rate hedging transactions 
the three month libor rate at december  was higher than the rate at december  this increase resulted in unrecognized gains by us from the rate hedging transactions 
we also terminated several rate hedge agreements during the year ended december   which resulted in a gain of approximately million
