item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for fiscal the components of revenues are sales  which consist of our sales of products and royalties on the sale of such products by others  and contract revenues 
sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year due to increased oncaspar and adagen sales 
oncaspar sales for the year ended june  increased due to the lifting in november of some of the temporary labeling and distribution restrictions which were placed on oncaspar by the fda as a result of certain difficulties encountered in our manufacturing process discussed below 
the increase was also due to an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which we market  for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
we market adagen internally and oncaspar through marketing agreements in the us and canada with aventis pharmaceuticals and in europe with medac gmbh 
during  we began to experience manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to an increase in the levels of particulates in batches of oncaspar which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
during fiscal  as a result of these manufacturing problems  we agreed with the fda to temporary labeling and distribution restrictions for oncaspar 
aventis stopped distributing oncaspar and we took over distribution of oncaspar directly to patients on an as needed basis 
we also instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution of the product 
in addition  during may  the fda required us to limit distribution of the product to only those patients who are hypersensitive to native l asparaginase 
in november  the fda lifted this distribution restriction 
we have been able to manufacture several batches of oncaspar  which contain acceptable levels of particulates  and have submitted modifications to our manufacturing process to the fda 
we anticipate a final resolution of the problem during fiscal it is expected that aventis will resume distribution of oncaspar at that time 
we cannot assure you that this solution will be acceptable to the fda or aventis 
if we are unable to resolve this problem the fda may not permit us to continue to distribute oncaspar 
an extended disruption in the marketing and distribution of oncaspar may have a material adverse effect on future sales of the product 
we expect sales of adagen to increase at rates comparable to those achieved during the last two years as additional patients are treated 
we also anticipate oncaspar sales will remain at reduced levels until we resolve the manufacturing problem and aventis resumes normal distribution of the product 
we cannot assure you that any particular sales levels of adagen or oncaspar will be achieved or maintained 
during june  we began recording royalties on sales of peg intron by schering plough 
peg intron received marketing authorization in the european union in may and was launched in several european countries during june launches in additional european countries are expected to occur during the next quarter 
during the years ended june  and  we had export sales of  and  respectively 
of these amounts  sales in europe were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
contract revenues for the year ended june  increased by  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in contract revenues was principally due to a  milestone payment from our development partner for peg intron  schering plough 
the payment was a result of the fda s acceptance in january of schering plough s us marketing application for the use of peg intron in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
revenues for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  for the year ended june  due to a decrease in contract revenue 
our sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was due to an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which we market  were  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  we market our other approved product  oncaspar  through marketing agreements in the us and canada with aventis and in europe with medac 
oncaspar revenues are comprised of manufacturing revenues  as well as royalties on sales of oncaspar by aventis 
oncaspar revenues for fiscal decreased due to a decline in manufacturing and royalty revenues resulting from difficulties encountered in our manufacturing process and the resulting changes in labeling and distribution 
contract revenue for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease was principally due to the fact that we received milestone payments in under our licensing agreement for peg intron with schering plough and we did not receive any such payments in during the year ended june   we recognized  in milestone payments we received when schering plough advanced peg intron into a phase iii clinical trial 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended june  was as compared to in during each of the years ended june  and  we recorded a charge related to a write off of oncaspar finished goods on hand 
the write offs of oncaspar finished goods were attributable to the manufacturing problems previously discussed 
the write off recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal represents certain batches of oncaspar which will become obsolete if the fda approves our proposed manufacturing modification for oncaspar 
this manufacturing modification was designed to correct the previously discussed oncaspar manufacturing problems 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to a charge taken in the first quarter of fiscal related to a write off of oncaspar finished goods on hand and in the distribution pipeline  as well as increased oncaspar production costs 
the increased write off of oncaspar finished goods was attributable to the manufacturing problems previously discussed 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  in the increase in research and development expenses resulted from an increase in expenses related to the clinical development of prothecan peg camptothecin and other peg products in pre clinical development 
we expect research and development expense to continue to increase significantly as prothecan advances to phase ii clinical trials  an additional peg compound enters phase i clinical trials and increased pre clinical testing on additional products under development 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased by to  from  for the year ended june  the decrease in research and development expenses resulted from a decrease in facility costs resulting from the elimination of a leased facility and the consolidation of research and development operations and a decline in clinical trial costs 
the decrease in clinical trial costs was a result of the completion of a phase ib clinical trial for peg hemoglobin in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  in the increase in selling general and administrative cost was principally due to a net charge to earnings recorded in the third quarter included in selling  general and administrative expenses of  this net charge was the result of a  payment we made  pursuant to a binding arbitration in a previously disclosed lawsuit brought by lbc capital resources inc  a former financial advisor  for fees related to our private placement  partially offset by the reversal of certain other contingency reserves 
the increase was also due to an increase in legal fees associated with patent filing and defense costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing and distribution costs for oncaspar 
due to the changes in distribution previously discussed  we were responsible for all marketing and distribution for this product in during the prior year  these costs were the responsibility of aventis 
other income expense 
other income expense increased by  to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for last year 
the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income due to an increase in interest bearing investments 
other income expense increased by  to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the year ended june  this increase was due to an increase in interest income due to an increase in interest bearing investments 
liquidity and capital resources our total cash reserves  including cash and interest bearing investments  as of june  were  as compared to  as of june  the increase in total cash reserves was due to the completion of a public offering during march  in which we sold  shares of common stock at a gross offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds of  we invest our excess cash in a portfolio of high grade marketable securities and united states government backed securities 
our aventis license agreement  as amended  for oncaspar provided for a payment of  in advance royalties which was received from aventis in january royalties due under the amended agreement will be offset against an original credit of  which represents the royalty advance plus reimbursement of certain amounts due aventis under the previous agreement and interest expense  before cash payments will be made under the agreement 
the royalty advance is shown as a long term liability  with the corresponding current portion included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and to be reduced as royalties are recognized under the agreement 
through june   an aggregate of  in royalties payable by aventis has been offset against the original credit 
as of june    shares of series a preferred shares had been converted into  shares of common stock 
accrued dividends on the converted series a preferred shares in the aggregate of  were settled by the issuance of  shares of common stock and cash payments of  as of june   there were accrued and unpaid dividends totaling  on the  shares of series a preferred shares currently outstanding 
these dividends are payable in cash or common stock at our option and accrue on the outstanding series a preferred shares at the rate of  per year 
during august  we made a million payment to aventis to settle a disagreement over the purchase price of oncaspar under the supply agreement and to settle aventis claim that we should be responsible for its lost profits while oncaspar is under the temporary labeling and distribution modifications previously discussed 
to date  our sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of our stock through public and private placements  sales and royalties of adagen  oncaspar and peg intron  sales of our products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees and royalty advances 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales and royalties of adagen  oncaspar and peg intron  sales of our products for research purposes and license fees 
based upon our currently planned research and development activities and related costs and our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products  to fund future operations 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
year in  we completed a review of our business systems  including computer systems and manufacturing equipment  and queried our customers and vendors as to their progress in identifying and addressing problems that their systems may face in correctly interrelating and processing date information in the year to date  we have not experienced any significant problems related to the year problem  either in our systems or the systems of our vendors or customers 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and subsequently amended by sfas no 
this statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
the effective date of sfas no 
was delayed to fiscal year by the issuance of sfas no 
we will adopt this statement as of july  we have determined this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors we have a history of losses and we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
the size of these losses will depend primarily on the receipt and timing of regulatory approval of peg intron and schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron  as well as on the rate of growth in our other product sales or royalty revenue and on the level of our expenses 
our two fda approved products are not generating significant revenues because neither product has become widely used due to a small patient population base and limitations on their indicated uses 
our ability to achieve long term profitability will depend upon our or our licensees ability to obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that our products will achieve market acceptance or will be commercialized successfully or that our operations will be profitable 
our near term success is heavily dependent on fda approval of peg intron and schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron 
under our agreement with schering plough  pursuant to which we applied our peg technology to develop a modified form of schering plough s intron a  we will receive royalties on worldwide sales of peg intron  if any 
schering plough is responsible for conducting and funding the clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing the product worldwide on an exclusive basis 
in may  schering plough announced that it had received a marketing authorization from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  for peg intron in the european union for the treatment of hepatitis c 
in december  schering plough completed submission of a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda seeking marketing approval of peg intron for the treatment of hepatitis c 
schering plough had requested priority review status from the fda of this bla 
in february  the fda accepted schering plough s bla for peg intron for standard review  rather than priority review 
standard review typically takes months from the date of filing 
we have not had access to schering plough s bla  nor have we been able to review the bla 
if schering plough does not receive marketing approval from the fda in a timely manner  or at all  it will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
schering plough currently markets intron a together with rebetol as combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c and intron a as a stand alone treatment for hepatitis c 
if the current bla is approved by the fda  schering plough will be able to market peg intron only as a stand alone or monotherapy treatment for hepatitis c 
schering plough is conducting a phase iii clinical trial of peg intron as combination therapy with rebetol for hepatitis c and phase iii clinical trials of peg intron for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and malignant melanoma 
if those trials are successful  peg intron may be the subject of future blas for those indications 
we cannot assure you that schering plough will seek or obtain marketing approval to sell peg intron for these additional indications or for combination therapy 
although schering plough is obligated under our agreement to use commercial efforts to market peg intron  we cannot assure you that schering plough will be successful in marketing peg intron or that schering plough will not continue to market intron a  either as a stand alone product or in combination therapy with rebetol  even if peg intron receives fda approval 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by schering plough to the development and marketing of peg intron is not within our control 
if schering plough breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to work diligently toward fda approval of the product for additional indications  the commercialization of peg intron could be slowed or blocked completely 
our revenues will be negatively affected if schering plough continues to market intron a in competition with peg intron or if it cannot meet the manufacturing demands of the market 
if schering plough does not use commercial efforts to market peg intron  or it otherwise breaches the agreement  a dispute may arise between us 
a dispute would be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of peg intron  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is currently patent litigation  which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
hoffmann la roche has sued schering plough and claimed that the peg technology used in peg intron infringes a patent held by hoffmann la roche 
the litigation is at a very early stage  and we cannot predict its outcome 
prior to the commencement of this litigation we obtained an opinion of patent counsel that the patent held by hoffmann la roche is invalid 
however  this opinion is not binding on any court or the us patent and trademark office 
we cannot assure you that the patent opinion will prove to be correct and that a court would find any of the claims of such patents to be invalid or that the product developed by us or our collaborator does not infringe such patents 
if this litigation is not resolved favorably for schering plough and schering plough is prevented from marketing peg intron  we would not receive any royalties on sales of peg intron 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in december  we filed a patent infringement suit against shearwater polymers  a company that has reportedly developed a branched peg  or u peg  used in hoffmann la roche s pegasys product  a peg modified version of its alpha interferon product called roferon a 
we believe that pegasys utilizes a type of branched peg  for which we have been granted a patent in the united states and have similar patents pending in europe  japan and canada 
shearwater has filed a counterclaim in this litigation alleging that our branched peg patent is invalid and unenforceable 
in september we filed a similar patent infringement suit against hoffman la roche in new jersey under a new continuation in part patent related to our original branched peg patent 
while an adverse outcome in this litigation will not prevent schering plough from commercializing peg intron  if we are not successful in our infringement suits or if our patent is held to be invalid  we may not be able to preclude shearwater from selling its branched peg or preclude hoffmann la roche from commercializing pegasys if it obtains regulatory approval 
if we are unable to enforce our patent rights in this area against others  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the course of our litigation proceedings with shearwater polymers and hoffman la roche and schering plough s litigation with hoffmann la roche  interim information about the status of each of these litigations may be released 
although these interim releases may differ from the final determinations in these litigations  such information may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with these regulations can be costly  time consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and abroad are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
the sale of any of our products for use in humans in the united states will require the prior approval of the fda 
similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
obtaining fda approval for a new therapeutic product may take several years and involve substantial expenditures 
adagen was approved by the fda in oncaspar was approved in the united states and in germany in  and in canada in  in each case for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are hypersensitive to native forms of l asparaginase 
oncaspar was approved in russia in april for therapeutic use in a broad range of cancers 
peg intron was approved in europe for the treatment of hepatitis c in may except for these approvals  none of our other products has been approved for sale and use in humans in the united states or elsewhere 
we cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain fda or other relevant marketing approval for any of our other products 
in addition  any approved products are subject to continuing regulation 
if we or our licensees fail to comply with applicable requirements it could result in o criminal penalties  o civil penalties  o fines  o recall or seizure  o injunctions requiring suspension of production  o orders requiring ongoing supervision by the fda  or o refusal by the government to approve marketing or export applications or to allow us to enter into supply contracts 
if we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested  it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products 
it could also limit the commercial use of our products 
any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced problems complying with the fda s regulations for manufacturing our products  and we may not be able to resolve these problems 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before they can be used in commercial manufacturing 
we or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
during  we began to experience manufacturing problems with one of our fda approved products  oncaspar 
the problems were due to increased levels of white particulates in batches of oncaspar  which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
during fiscal  we agreed with the fda to temporary labeling and distribution restrictions for oncaspar and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
during may  the fda required us to limit distribution of oncaspar to only those patients who are hypersensitive to native l asparaginase 
in november  the fda withdrew this distribution restriction 
in july  the fda conducted an inspection of our manufacturing facility in connection with our product license for adagen 
following that inspection  the fda documented several deviations from current good manufacturing practices  known as cgmp  in a form report 
we provided the fda with a corrective action plan 
in november  the fda issued a warning letter citing the same cgmp deviations listed in the july form  but it also stated that the fda was satisfied with our proposed corrective actions 
as a result of the deviations  the fda decided not to approve product export requests from us for oncaspar until it determines that all noted cgmp deviations have been corrected 
this restriction was removed in august in january  the fda conducted another inspection of our manufacturing facility relating to the oncaspar product license and as a follow up to the july inspection relating to adagen 
following this most recent inspection  the fda issued a form report  citing deviations from cgmp in the manufacture of oncaspar and two cgmp deviations for adagen 
we have responded to the fda with a corrective action plan to the january form however  we cannot assure you that the fda will not issue a warning letter with respect to the manufacture of oncaspar or that the fda will approve product export requests that we may make in the future 
while we expect to resolve these manufacturing problems by the end of fiscal  we cannot be certain that the solution will be acceptable to the fda 
if we cannot satisfactorily resolve these problems  the fda may not permit us to continue to distribute oncaspar or adagen 
if we cannot market and distribute oncaspar or adagen for an extended period  future sales of the products may suffer  which could adversely affect our financial results 
schering plough will be responsible for the manufacture of peg intron 
our clinical trials could take longer to complete and cost more than we expect 
we will need to conduct clinical studies of all of our product candidates 
these studies are costly  time consuming and unpredictable 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
schering plough is conducting clinical trials of our lead product candidate  peg intron  which is in phase iii trials as combination therapy with rebetol for treatment of hepatitis c and as stand alone therapy for two cancer indications 
we are currently conducting early stage clinical trials of our next peg product  prothecan 
clinical trials can be very costly and time consuming 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we or schering plough are unable to accrue sufficient clinical patients in our respective trials during the appropriate period  such trials may be delayed and will likely incur significant additional costs 
in addition  fda or institutional review boards may require us to delay  restrict  or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the cost of human clinical trials varies dramatically based on a number of factors  including o the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  o the extent of development and financial support from corporate collaborators  o the number of patients required for enrollment  o the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of the product candidate  and o the difficulty in obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of our clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we rely on corporate collaborators or academic institutions to conduct some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
we cannot assure you that these trials will commence or be completed as we expect or that they will be conducted successfully 
if pre clinical and clinical trials do not yield positive results  our products will fail 
if pre clinical and clinical testing of one or more of our product candidates do not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the desired indications  those potential products will fail 
numerous unforeseen events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following o the results of pre clinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  o potential products may not have the desired effect or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved  o results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  and o after reviewing test results  we or our corporate collaborators may abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be promising 
clinical testing is very costly and can take many years 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval  which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products  they may not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance of any kind 
the degree of market acceptance will depend on many factors  including o the receipt  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  o the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially competitive products  o the availability of third party reimbursement  and o the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of drug candidates  as well as their advantages over existing technologies and therapeutics 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
we depend on our collaborative partners 
if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
we rely heavily and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical companies  for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to many of our product candidates 
if we lose our collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked completely 
we cannot assure you that our collaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
our collaborators could develop competing products 
in addition  our revenues will be affected by the effectiveness of our corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products 
we cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we are dependent upon a single outside supplier for each of the crucial raw materials necessary to the manufacture of each of our products and product candidates 
we cannot assure you that sufficient quantities of our raw material requirements will be available to support the continued research  development or manufacture of our products 
we purchase the unmodified compounds utilized in our approved products and products under development from outside suppliers 
we may be required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certain unmodified compounds 
we do not produce the unmodified adenosine deaminase used in the manufacture of adagen or the unmodified forms of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar 
we have a supply contract with an outside supplier for the supply of each of these unmodified compounds 
if we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any unmodified compound  including unmodified adenosine deaminase or unmodified l asparaginase  on reasonable terms  or at all  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product  the fda and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in our clinical trials 
this testing could delay or stop development of a product  limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
if we are unable to demonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound  we will likely be required to repeat some or all of the pre clinical and clinical trials conducted for the compound 
the marketing of an fda approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted 
even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound  the fda or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material 
the united states and foreign patents upon which our original peg technology was based have expired 
we depend on patents and proprietary rights  which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products 
research corporation technologies  inc held the patent upon which our original peg technology was based and had granted us a license under such patent 
research corporation s patent contained broad claims covering the attachment of peg to polypeptides 
however  this united states patent and its corresponding foreign patents have expired 
based upon the expiration of the research corporation patent  other parties will be permitted to make  use or sell products covered by the claims of the research corporation patent  subject to other patents  including those which we hold 
we have obtained several patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking peg to therapeutic compounds 
we cannot assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent infringement or that competitors will not develop alternative methods of attaching peg to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents 
we are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the united states and other countries with respect to the application of peg to proteins and other compounds 
we cannot assure that the expiration of the research corporation patent or other patents related to peg that have been granted to third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies both in the united states and in other countries 
we have been licensed  and been issued  a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and we have other patent applications pending to protect our proprietary technology 
although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition  we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us  will afford us adequate protection from competing products  or will not be challenged or declared invalid 
in addition we cannot assure you that additional united states patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us 
the scope of patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain and our patents and patent applications are subject to this uncertainty 
to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base  we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties 
if we are unable to obtain such licenses  our product development efforts may be delayed or blocked 
we are aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our peg and sca technology patents 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patent and other rights against such organizations 
we expect that there will continue to be significant litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding patents and other proprietary rights 
we have become involved in patent litigation  and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we may incur substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in defending suits against us related to intellectual property rights 
such disputes could substantially delay our product development or commercialization activities  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed in business legal proceedings  there are three pending litigation matters either involving or affecting our products and patents 
the adverse disposition of either of these litigations will adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
we have limited sales and marketing experience  which makes us dependent on our marketing partners 
other than adagen  which we market on a worldwide basis to a small patient population  we have not engaged in the direct commercial marketing of any of our products and therefore we do not have significant experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
for some of our products  we have provided exclusive marketing rights to our corporate partners in return for milestone payments and royalties to be received on sales 
to the extent that we enter into licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our products  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that such third parties devote to our products 
in addition  if we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to increase the size of our internal sales force 
in any sales or marketing effort  we would compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against other such companies 
we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and this financing may not be available when we need it 
our current development projects require substantial capital 
we may require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization of potential products 
in addition  we may seek to acquire additional technologies 
we do not expect to achieve significant sales or royalty revenue from our current fda approved products  adagen and oncaspar 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will obtain significant revenue from peg intron in the near future  or ever 
additional funds from other sources may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs which would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
while we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o the level of revenues we receive from our fda approved products and product candidates  o continued progress of our research and development programs  o our ability to establish additional collaborative arrangements  o changes in our existing collaborative relationships  o progress with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance for our products  o the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments  and o our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to o delay  reduce the scope or eliminate one or more of our development projects  o obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or o license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would harm our research and development programs and our business 
the failure of computer systems to be year compliant could negatively impact our business 
in  we completed a review of our business systems  including computer systems and manufacturing equipment  and queried our customers and vendors as to their progress in identifying and addressing problems that their systems may face in correctly interrelating and processing date information in the year to date  we have not experienced any significant problems related to the year problem  either in our systems or the systems of our vendors or customers 
the failure of our computer systems to be year compliant could negatively impact our business 
risks related to our industry we face rapid technological change and intense competition  which could harm our business and results of operations 
the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may result in our products and technologies becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
we know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention  diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experiences and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs  as well as obtaining fda and other regulatory approval 
if we cannot compete effectively  our business and financial performance would suffer 
we may be sued for product liability 
because our products and product candidates are new treatments  with limited  if any  past use on humans  their use during testing or after approval could expose us to product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of million for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to fda approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after fda approval 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of our other products in the future 
also  this insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims and a product liability claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
sales of our products could be adversely affected if the costs for these products are not reimbursed by third party payors 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the united states 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in addition  government and private third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
our ability to commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of the products and related treatments will be available from third party payors 
if we or any of our collaborators succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in addition  lifetime limits on benefits included in most private health plans may force patients to self pay for treatment 
for example  patients who receive adagen are expected to require injections for their entire lives 
the cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients to self fund further treatment 
furthermore  inadequate third party coverage may lead to reduced market acceptance of our products 
significant changes in the health care system in the united states or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
risks related to our stock price the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors  including o the results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o announcements of technical innovations or new products by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements entered into by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o regulatory approvals of our products or those of our competitors  o changes in government regulation  o developments in the patents or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us or our competitors  o public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  o litigation  and o general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have especially affected the market price of the stock of many high technology and healthcare related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
nonetheless  these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
events with respect to our share capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market  or the availability of such shares for sale  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
as of june   we have  shares of common stock outstanding  excluding shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  and the conversion of outstanding preferred stock 
the following securities that may be exercised for  or are convertible into  shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding as of june  o options

o series a preferred stock 
 shares of our series a preferred stock  all of which were convertible into  shares of our common stock as of such date 
the shares of our common stock that may be issued under the warrants and options are either currently registered with the sec  or will be registered with the sec before the shares are purchased by the holders of the warrants and options 
the shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock are eligible for sale without any volume limitation pursuant to rule k under the securities act of  as amended 
the exercise of outstanding registration rights held by holders of our common and preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock and may impair our ability to raise additional funds 
as of june   there are demand and or piggyback registration rights on an aggregate of  shares of our outstanding common stock and common stock underlying outstanding warrants 
we granted schering plough piggyback registration rights with respect to  shares of our common stock 
in addition  two persons affiliated with evolution capital have piggyback and demand registration rights aggregating  shares with respect to common stock and common stock underlying warrants to purchase our common stock 
the demand rights give these warrant holders a one time right to require us to register  upon their request  that number of shares underlying such warrants 
we granted the carson group  inc and two of its principals  piggyback registration rights on a aggregate of  shares of common stock and common stock underlying warrants as consideration for finder s services that were provided to us 
transferees of clearwater fund iv were also granted piggyback registration rights under a registration rights agreement with us with respect to an aggregate of  shares of common stock and common shares underlying warrants  which are currently covered by an effective registration statement 
absent any contractual limitations  the holders of these rights could cause a significant number of shares of our common stock to be registered and sold in the public market 
such sales  or the perception that these sales could occur  may have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
we originally registered the resale of approximately  shares of our common stock owned by stockholders who purchased such shares in a private placement of our common stock that closed in july we originally registered the resale of approximately  shares of our common stock owned by stockholders who purchased such shares in a private placement of our common stock that closed in january and march we are required to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement until the earlier of the date that all of the shares are sold or march  our charter documents and delaware law may discourage a takeover of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire or merge with us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock  par value per share  and to determine the price and terms  including preferences and voting rights  of those shares without stockholder approval 
although we have no current plans to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  any such issuance could o have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  o discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price  or o adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing a classified board of directors  and our agreements with our executive officers that provide significant payments to them following a change in control of our company  could each have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities  and time deposits 
all such instruments are classified as securities held to maturity 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at june  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in two and a half years or less 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of june  total fair value fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate
