the increase in volume was partially offset by the basis point decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  peer loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the company s charge off policy varies with respect to the category of and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
the company records charge offs on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of collectibility 
in addition  any loans which are classified as loss in regulatory examinations are charged off 
the company records specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial mortgage and construction loans when a loan is considered to be impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on an evaluation of current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due principal and interest pursuant to the original contractual terms 
the company measures impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage  home equity  indirect auto and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment 
interest income on impaired loans is recognized using either the cash basis method or a cost recovery method depending upon the circumstances

the company s allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans outstanding was 
at december  as compared to 
in and 
in management believes the allowance for loan losses is at an adequate level 
the provision for loan losses is sufficient to provide for probable loan losses and maintain the allowance at an adequate level commensurate with management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
management of the subsidiary bank prepares a detailed analysis  at least quarterly  reviewing the adequacy of its allowance and  when appropriate  recommending an increase or decrease in its provision for loan losses 
the analysis to determine the allocated portion of the allowance is divided into two parts 
the first part involves primarily an estimated calculation of losses on specific problem and management watch list loans  the remaining credit card portfolio and delinquent consumer loans 
the second part involves primarily a calculation of the bank s actual net charge off history averaged with industry net charge off history by major loan categories including unfunded commitments 
in addition  the bank considers its loan growth  management capabilities  economic trends  credit concentrations  industry risks  underlying collateral values and the opinions of bank management 
accordingly  because each of these criteria is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
in order to identify potential risks in the loan portfolio and determine the necessary provision for loan losses  detailed information is obtained from the following sources 
regular reports prepared by the bank s management which contain information on the overall characteristics of the loan portfolio  including delinquencies and nonaccruals  and specific analysis of loans requiring special attention ie watch lists  
examinations of the loan portfolio of the subsidiary bank by federal and state regulatory agencies  and 
reviews by third party consultants and internal audit staff 
in addition to management s assessment of the portfolio  the company and the subsidiary bank are examined periodically by regulatory agencies 
although such agencies do not determine whether the allowance for loan loss is adequate  their examinations may result in increases to the allowance based on their judgements about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table considers both parts of the analysis discussed above to determine the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type for each of the last five years

interest income is recorded on these loans only as it is collected 
interest payments on nonaccrual loans which contain unusual risk features or marginal collateral values may be applied directly to loan principal for accounting purposes

the number of merchant outlets serviced increased to at year end from at year end merchant interchange expense in the other expense section rose  in fees on mortgages sold  servicing released  increased just slightly in the mortgage market was strong through the first half of  however  due to rising interest rates  mortgage loan refinance activity slowed down in the second half of the year

this increase was primarily the result of increased levels of performance based compensation  normal salary and benefit increases  higher compensation due to competitive market conditions and increased staffing requirements for the new lagrange office opened in september  the glen ellyn office opened in september and other growing areas of the bank 
occupancy and equipment expense combined increased  primarily due to the new lagrange office and a full year of operations at the glen ellyn office that opened in september  these increases are offset by lower depreciation expense due to certain assets having become fully depreciated in data processing fees increased  primarily as a result of additional trust processing fees and costs incurred for the testing of the company s operating systems for compliance with the year date change

the parent company also had cash  short term investments and other marketable securities totaling million at december  interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk arises when the maturity or repricing of assets differs significantly from the maturity or repricing of liabilities 
the company s financial results could be affected by changes in market interest rates such as the prime rate  libor and treasury yields as well as competitive rates for retail deposit products 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to provide the maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulation  rate shock analysis and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
the model incorporates management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products passbook savings  money market  now and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions are developed through historical analysis 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the mortgage related assets in each rate environment are captured using estimates of prepayment speeds for the portfolios 
other assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of other financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  and customer preferences 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the company s policy objective is to limit the change in annual net interest income to from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates rate shock of basis points 
as of december  and  the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile 
the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is not factored into the calculation 
bp bp bp bp annual interest income change from an immediate change in rates    percent change the table below presents a static gap analysis as of december  which does not fully capture the true dynamics of interest rate changes including the timing and or degree of interest rate changes
