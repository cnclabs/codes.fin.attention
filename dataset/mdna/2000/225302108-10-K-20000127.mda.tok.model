the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere herein 
our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  inventory obsolescence  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or reschedulings of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated fiscal years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold on net sales cost of goods sold special charges gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development special charges total operating expenses operating income loss vs net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of systems  upgrades  spare parts  maintenance contracts and software 
net sales declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales increased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal this was in sharp contrast to when our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales improved each sequential quarter because of three principal factors a significant increase in the worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  improved business and economic conditions in asia and particularly in taiwan  and the launch of three major products the valstar high performance digital tester  the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
these factors resulted in our experiencing increasing net sales activity through fiscal the improved worldwide demand for semiconductor ate has led to customers purchasing for increased capacity and the launch of our new products has led to some customers purchasing products with new features or capabilities 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur or worsen  which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage and the high percentage of net sales attributable to mixed signal products is principally derived from the sales of the new kalos and quartet products 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in was due primarily to relatively low gross margins in attributable to the special charges taken in that year 
we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold in totaling million  consisting primarily of write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  as more fully described below 
additionally  gross margins were negatively impacted due to lower average selling prices caused by increased competition in the markets the company serves and due to inefficiencies caused by the lower manufacturing volumes 
research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses declined in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
we restructured our business in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to a major downturn in the business at that time 
as a result of that industry downturn  we downsized our operations including reduced headcount  reduced and delayed projects including facility expansions and certain research and development projects 
we currently intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development of new products and enhancements for the foreseeable future and would expect r d expenses to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than those recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from our downsizing which occurred in the latter half of fiscal we restructured our business in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to a major downturn in the business at that time 
as a result of that industry downturn  we downsized our operations including reduced headcount  reduced and delayed projects including facility expansions 
during early fiscal  we undertook a project to replace a majority of our financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc this system became operational in june in september  we relocated our oregon operations to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
because of these and other investments  we anticipate that sg a expenses will be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than those recorded in fiscal in process research and development 
in september  we purchased opmaxx  inc for million in cash and the assumption of liabilities and the conversion of employee stock options worth million 
additionally  we agreed to make payments to the common shareholders of opmaxx in an amount equal to of the net receipts from sales of the opmaxx products from september through december  in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
the remaining million has been capitalized  of which million is for purchased technology and other intangible assets which will be amortized ratably over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to five years 
opmaxx is being integrated with our subsidiary  fluence technology  inc our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
our review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to us in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the ipr d acquired from opmaxx consists of products and projects related to analog and mixed signal self test 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of design verification and sensitivity analysis  design fault coverage  test evaluation and optimization 
we estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on time spent and complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
the significant work remaining to complete the current versions of the products was estimated to take approximately engineering person years  at a cost of approximately million and be completed by the end of fiscal special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was for employee severance and million was for abandoned facilities 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries at that time as well as the decision to relocate our oregon operations from a facility in beaverton to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
this charge included expenses related to the opmaxx acquisition of million as well as the million write down of certain intangible assets from another acquisition in the integration of opmaxx with fluence 
extraordinary gain extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax extraordinary gain of million for the retirement of million of our convertible subordinated notes in exchange for  shares of our common stock held in treasury 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower average cash and investment balances in as compared to these lower average balances were the result of our net losses in fiscal as well as million dispersed for the repurchase of our common stock during interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expense on a lower outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal and the tax benefit rate for both years was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible in process research and development expenses 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately  of future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income 
a valuation allowance was established in both fiscal and to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets attributable to the in process research and development 
due to the period over which these tax benefits will be recognized  sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of a portion of these assets to warrant a valuation allowance 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
vs net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal the year over year increase over was driven primarily by increased worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  including our products  during the end of calendar and including the first quarter of our fiscal this was followed by a very significant decline in worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  which led to a material decline in net sales of our products in the last three quarters of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales were also materially adversely affected by our inability to complete three major product introductions  consisting of the valstar high performance digital tester  the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
we believe that our existing completed products were being primarily purchased when our customers required increased capacity and that these three newer products  once completed  will be primarily purchased by customers seeking increased functionality instead of or in addition to increased capacity 
we believe we will be unable to achieve a significant increase in our net sales until either increased demand for semiconductors causes an increase in capacity buys or until we complete our major product introductions and can generate increased functionality buys with our newer products 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may continue or worsen  which could continue to materially adversely affect demand for our products 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to special charges taken in fiscal as a result of a significant decrease in net sales in the last three quarters of fiscal we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold in totaling million  consisting primarily of write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  as more fully described below 
additionally  gross margins were negatively impacted due to lower average selling prices caused by increased competition in the markets we serve and due to inefficiencies caused by the lower manufacturing volumes 
research and development 
r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting continued investments in the development of new products  as well as enhancements of existing product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from marketing costs associated with new product introductions and higher operating expenses associated with acquisitions made during and the last half of fiscal  partially offset by decreases in expenditures in the latter three quarters of fiscal as we responded to the general downturn in the semiconductor industry 
during this period of depressed revenues  we undertook a project to replace a majority of our financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc this system became operational in june in process research and development 
in june  the company purchased from heuristics physics laboratories  inc certain assets and assumed certain liabilities relating to their memory self test business for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
additionally  the company agreed to make payments to the shareholder representatives of heuristics in an amount equal to of our net sales of products derived from the assets acquired from heuristics design for test division for a period of two years following the acquisition 
the amounts paid in under this arrangement were insignificant 
in connection with the heuristics acquisition  we recognized million of acquired in process research and development 
the remaining million has been capitalized  of which million is for purchased technology and other intangible assets which will be amortized ratably over their estimated useful lives of five years 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated  by both interviews and data analysis  to determine our state of development and related fair value 
our review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to us in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the heuristics acquired ipr d consists of projects related to memory self test 
these projects are aimed at the development of products that can perform self testing of on chip memories  self testing of off chip memories  automated memory test vector generation  built in memory repair analysis and built in automated memory circuit repair 
the company estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
as of october   the company has introduced memory bost products and has largely completed development of a memory bist software product 
the company recorded a million write down of the intangible assets acquired from heuristics in conjunction with the integration of opmaxx with fluence in september this asset write down was made based on an assessment of the current market potential for these products 
there can be no assurance that these projects or products will achieve technological feasibility or that the company will be able to successfully market these products 
during fiscal  the company expensed million of ipr d resulting from the acquisition of certain assets of summit design  inc and summit s wholly owned subsidiary  test systems strategies  inc the ipr d associated with the test systems strategies acquisition related to the development of standard tester interface language  or stil  tools 
the stil development project is an ongoing program that will provide a foundation for and be integrated into most of the fluence software products 
we believe the life of this program will continue into the foreseeable future 
special charges 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was classified as cost of goods sold and the balance was classified as operating expenses 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the current and forecasted business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries which took place during the period 
as a result of this industry downturn  we have downsized our operations including reducing headcount  reducing the volume of products being produced and canceling and delaying various projects  including facilities expansions and certain research and development projects 
the impact of this downturn and these decisions is that significant amounts of our inventories  receivables  fixed assets  prepaid expenses  investments and purchased technologies have been impaired and certain liabilities have been incurred 
as a result  we have written down the related assets to their net realizable values and made provision for the estimated liabilities 
of the million in charges  approximately million was charged as cost of goods sold  of which approximately million was related to write down of excess or obsolete inventories 
the elements of the charges during fiscal are as follows in thousands write down of inventories to net realizable value including expected losses on supplier commitments  write down of excess fixed assets to fair value  write down of purchased technology and investments to fair value  write off of prepaid and other current assets  excess facility costs  provision for uncollectible receivables  employee termination benefits and accrued liabilities  at october   approximately million in accrued liabilities related to special charges remained on our balance sheet  primarily the accrued loss on supplier commitments of million and approximately million for rent on excess facilities 
the cash expenditures associated with these obligations will occur primarily in fiscal cash expenditures associated with the special charges during fiscal were approximately  relating primarily to excess facilities and to severance costs 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was due to interest earned on significantly higher average cash and investments balances provided by the receipt of proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes issued in late fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the interest expense on our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
our effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was  and the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax benefit rate in was reduced  and the effective tax rate in was increased by non deductible in process research and development expenses 
year readiness the year issue results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
when computer systems must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
the results of these errors may range from minor undetected errors to the complete shutdown of an affected system 
these errors or failures may have limited effects  or the effects may be widespread  depending on the computer chip  system or software  and its location and function 
the effects of the year problem are exacerbated because of the interdependence of computer and telecommunications systems in the united states and throughout the world 
because of this interdependence  the failure of one system may lead to the failure of many other systems  even though the other systems are themselves year compliant 
our board of directors has reviewed the year issue generally and as it may affect our business activity 
we implemented a year plan which is designed to cover all of our activities 
the plan will be modified as circumstances change and is monitored by our board of directors 
the impact of year issues on our business will depend not only on corrective actions that we have taken and will continue to take  but also on the way year issues are addressed by governmental agencies  businesses and other third parties that provide us with services or data or receive services or data from us  or whose financial condition or operational capability is important to us 
to reduce this exposure  we have an ongoing process of identifying and contacting mission critical third party vendors and other significant third parties to determine their year issues and results 
risks associated with any such third parties located outside the united states may be higher insofar as it is generally believed that non us businesses may not be addressing their year issues on as timely a basis as us businesses 
notwithstanding our efforts  we cannot be certain that we  mission critical third party vendors or other significant third parties will adequately address their year issues 
although it is difficult for us to estimate the total costs of implementing the plan  our current estimate is that such costs have been approximately million through october and will be approximately  additionally thereafter 
however  although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  we cannot be certain  for the reasons stated in the next paragraph  that the actual costs of implementing the plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs 
a significant portion of total year project expenses is represented by existing staff that have been redeployed to this project 
we do not believe that the redeployment of existing staff will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
nor do we expect incremental expenses related to the year project to materially impact operating results in any one period 
although we are not aware of any material operational issues associated with the year  we cannot ensure that we will not experience material unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in such systems or by our failure to adequately prepare for the results of such errors or defects  including the costs of related litigation  if any 
the impact of such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to net income before depreciation and amortization  extraordinary gain and special charges of million  income tax refunds of million  offset by cash used for net changes in the remaining operating assets and liabilities  particularly accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million 
this cash was primarily used for net purchases of property and equipment of million  million was used to purchase other assets including opmaxx  inc and million was used to purchase available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in accordance with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we also recorded non cash transactions during the year for the exchange of  shares of our common stock held in treasury for an aggregate of million of its convertible subordinated notes 
these transactions resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax of million  as well as an increase in paid in capital of million 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  compared with million at october  we have million available under its unsecured bank line of credit expiring in july at october   there were no amounts outstanding under these agreements 
borrowings are subject to our compliance with financial and other covenants 
we have outstanding long term debt of million consisting of convertible subordinated notes due in september additionally  as of october   we have operating leases for facilities and test and other equipment totaling approximately million due through we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances  together with our current line of credit  net proceeds for a public offering of our common stock in february and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy its financing requirements for at least the next months 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we have introduced and plan to continue to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
significant investments in accounts receivable and inventories subject us to increased risks  and could continue to materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to the above factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of costs accrued for warranty and other liabilities 
such changes could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we maintain a strict investment policy which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  us treasury notes and obligations of us government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations in thousands  except percentages 
thereafter cash equivalents fixed rate   average rate restricted cash fixed rate  average rate short term investments fixed rate    average rate long term investments fixed rate       average rate total investment securities        average rate long term debt   fixed rate average rate we mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our million convertible subordinated notes 
we have a million line of credit under which we can borrow either at the bank s prime rate or as a function of the libor rate 
as of october   we had no borrowings under our line of credit
