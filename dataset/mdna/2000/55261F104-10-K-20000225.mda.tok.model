overview m t reported net income in of million or of diluted earnings per common share  increases of and  respectively  from million or per diluted share in basic earnings per common share rose to in  an increase of from in net income totaled million in  while diluted and basic earnings per share were and  respectively 
the after tax impact of nonrecurring expenses associated with the merger and acquisition activity previously described was million million pre tax or 
of diluted earnings per share and 
of basic earnings per share in  compared with million million pre tax or of diluted earnings per share and of basic earnings per share in the impact on s net income resulting from the fnb and chase branch acquisitions was not material 
net income represented a return on average assets in of  compared with in and in the return on average common stockholders equity was in  in and in excluding the impact of merger related expenses  the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in were and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  in growth in average loans and leases was the most significant factor contributing to a increase in taxable equivalent net interest income to million in from million in average loans and leases rose to billion in  an increase of from billion in similarly  average earning assets totaled billion in  up from billion in a increase in average loans outstanding in  including the impact of the billion of loans obtained on april  in the onbancorp acquisition  was the most significant factor for the rise in that year s net interest income from million in average loans and average earning assets in were billion and billion  respectively 
improvement in s net interest income resulting from asset growth was partially offset by a reduction of the company s net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest margin in was  compared with in and in the provision for credit losses in was million  compared with million in and million in net charge offs totaled million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding declined to 
in  from 
in and 
in in january  m t contributed appreciated investment securities with a fair value of million to an affiliated  tax exempt private charitable foundation 
as a result of the contribution  in the company recognized charitable contributions expense of million and recognized tax exempt other income of million 
the contribution provided an income tax benefit of approximately million and  accordingly  resulted in an after tax increase in s net income of thousand  or 
per diluted share 
excluding the effect of this contribution  noninterest income of million in increased from million in and was above the million earned in growth in mortgage banking revenues  fees earned from deposit services  and a full year of revenues associated with operations obtained in the onbancorp acquisition were factors contributing to the increase from to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the onbancorp acquisition  along with higher revenues from mortgage banking  trust activities and bank owned life insurance contributed to the increase from to approximately of the increase from to was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the onbancorp acquisition 
noninterest expenses associated with operations  which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and certain nonrecurring expenses  were million in  an increase of from million in the excluded items consist of nonrecurring merger related expenses of million and million in and  respectively  amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of million in and million in  and million of expense related to the previously mentioned contribution to the affiliated charitable foundation in higher expenses related to salaries  employee benefits and occupancy contributed to the higher expense level in compared with after excluding million of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  noninterest expenses associated with operations in totaled million 
operating expenses related to the acquired operations of onbancorp significantly contributed to the increase from to the efficiency ratio  or noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  measures how much of a company s revenue is consumed by operating expenses 
reflecting the smooth integration of the and acquisitions  m t s efficiency ratio  calculated using the adjusted income and expense totals noted above and excluding gains from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income  improved significantly to in from in and in cash operating results as a result of the acquisitions of onbancorp  fnb and the chase branches and  to a significantly lesser extent  acquisitions of other entities in prior years  the company had recorded as assets goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
since the amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible does not result in a cash expense  m t believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on a cash or tangible basis which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the related asset balances represents a relevant measure of financial performance 
the supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non cash operating expenses such as depreciation  provision for credit losses  or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations 
unless noted otherwise  cash basis data does  however  exclude the after tax impact of nonrecurring merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of onbancorp  fnb and the chase branches

the impact of the fnb and chase branch acquisitions on cash net income was not material

including the effect of merger related expenses  the cash return on average tangible assets for and was and  respectively  and the cash return on average tangible common equity was and  respectively 
net interest income lending and funding activities taxable equivalent net interest income rose to million in from million in  largely the result of growth in average earning assets  which increased billion or to billion in from billion in taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
the growth in average earning assets in and was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding 
average loans and leases totaled billion in  up from billion in and higher than billion in the impact of the million of loans obtained in the fnb transaction in june and the full year impact of loans acquired in the april onbancorp transaction contributed to the higher average loan balances in compared with the primary reason for the higher loan balances in as compared to was the billion of loans obtained in the onbancorp acquisition  including approximately million of commercial loans  million of commercial real estate loans  billion of residential mortgage loans and million of consumer loans 
partially offsetting these increases in average loans and leases in was the impact of the july sale of m t s retail credit card business  including approximately million of outstanding credit card balances as of the sale date 
average credit card balances  including cards issued to small businesses  were million in  compared with million in and million in the accompanying table summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years 
loans secured by real estate  including home equity loans and outstanding home equity lines of credit which the company classifies as consumer loans  represented approximately of the loan and lease portfolio during and  up from in at december   the company held approximately billion of commercial real estate loans  billion of consumer real estate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties and million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit  compared with billion  billion and million  respectively  at december  commercial real estate loans originated by the company are predominately secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area  including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of new york city  and western new york  which includes buffalo  niagara falls  rochester and surrounding areas 
commercial real estate loans are also originated in the syracuse  albany  hudson valley and southern tier regions of new york state  as well as in northeastern pennsylvania 
historically  commercial real estate loans originated by the company are fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity  in many cases five years after origination 
for borrowers in good standing  the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
in response to customer needs  in recent years the company has also originated fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years 
in general  these loans have original maturity terms of approximately ten years 
the company also originates adjustable rate commercial real estate loans 
as of december   approximately of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans 
the accompanying table presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at december  of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area  approximately were secured by multi family residential properties  by retail space and by office space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less  while loans of more than million made up approximately of the total 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in new york state tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of these new york state loans were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of new york state and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the new york city metropolitan area comprised of total commercial real estate loans as of december  of the million of commercial construction loans presented in the accompanying table  million represent loans for which the company has also committed to provide permanent financing 
at december   commercial construction loans represented of total loans and leases 
real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled billion at december   including approximately secured by properties located in new york state 
at december   million of residential real estate loans were held for sale by m t mortgage corporation  the company s mortgage banking subsidiary 
consumer loans and leases represented approximately of the average loan portfolio during  compared with and in and  respectively 
automobile loans and leases and home equity loans and lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio 
approximately of home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at december  were secured by properties in new york state 
at december   of the automobile loan and lease portfolio was to customers residing in new york state  while the remainder was largely to customers in pennsylvania 
automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers  however  all applications submitted by dealers are subject to the company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures 
automobile loans and leases represented approximately of the company s average loan portfolio during  while no other consumer loan product represented more than 
the average outstanding balance of automobile leases outstanding was approximately million in  million in and million in due to poorer than expected results  during and the company terminated all of its co branded credit card programs and sold its retail credit card business on july   including outstanding balances of approximately million 
the company s portfolio of investment securities averaged billion in  billion in and billion in the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  commercial real estate mortgage backed securities  and shorter term us treasury notes 
the company has also invested in debt securities issued by municipalities and debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
the company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads  actual or anticipated prepayments  or credit risk associated with a particular security 
the size of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  the level of deposits  and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios 
money market assets  which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks  interest earning trading account assets  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities  averaged million in  compared with million in and million in core deposits represent the most significant source of funding to the company and consist of noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under  core deposits generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities 
the company s branch network is its principal source of core deposits 
certificates of deposit under  generated on a nationwide basis by m t bank  na are also included in core deposits 
average core deposits were billion in  up from billion in and billion in the increases in average core deposits in and reflect the chase branch and fnb acquisitions and the onbancorp acquisition 
core deposits obtained in the chase branch acquisition as of september  and in the fnb acquisition as of june  were million and million  respectively 
core deposits obtained in the acquisition of onbancorp totaled approximately billion on april  average core deposits of m t bank  na were million in  million in and million in funding provided by core deposits totaled of average earning assets in  compared with in and in the accompanying table summarizes average core deposits in and percentage changes in the components over the past two years 
supplementing core deposits  the company obtains funding through domestic time deposits of  or more  deposits originated through the company s offshore branch office  and brokered certificates of deposit 
domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged billion in  compared with billion in and billion in offshore branch deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
brokered deposits averaged billion in  compared with billion in and  and totaled billion at december  brokered deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings to lengthen the average maturity of interest bearing liabilities 
the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at december  was years 
however  certain of the deposits have provisions that allow early redemption 
in connection with the company s management of interest rate risk  interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms similar to the amounts and terms of many of the brokered deposits 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time 
the company also uses borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh together  the fhlb  and others as sources of funding 
short term borrowings averaged billion in  billion in and million in the average balance of long term borrowings was billion in  compared with million in and million in included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the fhlb of billion in  million in and million in  as well as million of subordinated capital notes issued in prior years by m t bank 
average long term borrowings also include trust preferred securities with a carrying value of million that were issued by special purpose entities in further information regarding the trust preferred securities  as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings  is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads 
net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  compared with in the yield on earning assets decreased basis points hundredths of one percent to in from in similarly  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in the declines in yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities were due to generally lower interest rates in when compared with however  actions taken by the federal reserve during the third and fourth quarters of have resulted in an increase in interest rates 
in  the net interest spread was  the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 
lower yielding residential real estate loans  consumer loans and investment securities acquired in the onbancorp transaction  the july sale of the company s retail credit card business  and competitive pressure on interest rates charged for newly originated loans  particularly commercial loans and commercial real estate loans  contributed to the decline in yield in as compared with net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  partially offset by goodwill and core deposit intangible  bank owned life insurance and other non earning assets 
net interest free funds contributed 
to net interest margin in  compared with 
in and 
in average net interest free funds totaled billion in  billion in and billion in the decline in the contribution to net interest margin of net interest free funds in and from was due  in part  to the goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the fnb  chase branch and onbancorp acquisitions which averaged million in and million in and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance which averaged million in  compared with million in and million in 
increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income  but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations 
these two noninterest earning assets mitigated much of the benefit derived from increases in stockholders equity and or noninterest bearing deposits resulting from the fnb  chase branch and onbancorp transactions 
future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the loan and deposit portfolios 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
excluding forward starting swaps  the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately billion 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
however  under terms of million of swaps  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
to help manage exposure resulting from changing interest rates in future years  as of december   the company had also entered into forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million in which the company will pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate 
such forward starting swaps had no effect on the company s net interest income through december  the average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes  the related effect on net interest income and margin  and the weighted average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes had been terminated  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates and should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet and the company s overall interest rate risk profile 
with the exception of swaps having a notional amount of million that were entered into for the purpose of modifying the repricing characteristics of fixed rate  available for sale investment securities  changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
provision for credit losses the purpose of the provision for credit losses is to adjust the company s allowance for credit losses to a level that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net loan charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 
in  
in and 
in nonperforming loans totaled million or 
of loans and leases outstanding at december   compared with million or 
a year earlier and million or 
at december  the allowance for credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end  and was  and  respectively 
the decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at december  and as compared with december  and prior years reflects management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each date  the relatively favorable economic environment for many commercial borrowers in the two recent years  the july sale of the retail credit card business  and other factors 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
significant loans are individually analyzed  while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category 
given the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  coupled with the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and significant growth in recent years in loans to individual consumers  management cautiously evaluated the impact of interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses as of december  based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date 
the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by the company s internal loan review department and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in market regions served by the company  in particular areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area that have not experienced the same degree of economic growth evident in much of the rest of the country in recent years  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas of new york state and pennsylvania entered through the acquisition of onbancorp  and or new loan product types  including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years  and  iv the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
the economy in new york state  in general  and the upstate new york region comprised of areas outside of metropolitan new york city  in particular  continues to lag behind the rest of the country 
marginal job growth  coupled with a declining population base  has left the upstate new york region susceptible to potential credit problems  particularly related to commercial customers 
given the company s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in new york state  including the upstate new york region  and considering the other factors already discussed  the level of the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses is deemed prudent and reasonable 
nevertheless  the allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category 
accordingly  the amounts presented in the table are not necessarily indicative of future losses within the individual loan categories 
several factors influence the company s credit loss experience  including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate and economic conditions  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property 
nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
during  the company realized net recoveries of charged off commercial real estate loans of million 
during and  net charge offs of commercial real estate loans were million and 
million  respectively 
net charge offs of consumer loans and leases were million in  or

net charge offs of residential real estate loans were million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming at december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
commercial real estate loans secured by multi family properties in the new york city metropolitan area represented of loans outstanding at december  the company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries  and only million of outstanding foreign loans at december  assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million a year earlier and million at the end of other income other income rose to million in from million in  after excluding million of tax exempt income in resulting from the previously noted transfer of appreciated investment securities to an affiliated  tax exempt charitable foundation 
growth in mortgage banking revenues  fees earned from deposit services  and a full year of revenues associated with operations obtained in the onbancorp acquisition contributed to the improvement 
other income was million in revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the onbancorp acquisition  along with higher revenues from mortgage banking  trust activities and bank owned life insurance contributed to the increase from to approximately of the increase from to was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the former onbancorp

residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled billion in  compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
residential mortgage loans serviced for others were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
capitalized servicing assets were million at december  and  compared with million at december  reflecting a third quarter increase in fees  combined with the impact of the fnb  chase branch and onbancorp acquisitions  service charges on deposit accounts rose to million in from million in  and from million in fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly served by onbancorp contributed approximately three fourths of the increase from to trust income increased to million in from million in and from million in the increases in both and were largely due to higher revenues for investment management services 
merchant discount and other credit card fees in totaled million  compared with million in and million in as noted earlier  during and the company terminated all of its co branded credit card programs  and sold its retail credit card business on july  total credit card fees included in merchant discount and credit card fees in were approximately million  compared with approximately million and million in and  respectively 
through the date of sale  the results of operations of the retail credit card business in  including internal allocations of the provision for credit losses  interest expense and other expenses  were essentially break even 
on the same basis  the company s retail credit card business incurred losses of approximately million in trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of thousand in  down from million in and million in the decline in was largely the result of an approximate million loss incurred as a result of a counterparty defaulting on the settlement of outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
during  the company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of million 
similar gains on sales of bank investment securities in were million  compared with losses of thousand in other revenues from operations increased to million in  compared with million in excluding the effect of the contribution of securities to the affiliated foundation and million in such amounts include million  million and million in  and  respectively  of tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance 
also included in other revenues from operations were revenues from the sales of mutual funds and annuities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a million increase in revenues from letter of credit and other credit related fees also contributed to the rise in other revenues from operations in from other items that contributed to the increase in as compared with include a million gain from the sale of the company s retail credit card business and higher revenues for automated teller machine service fees 
other expense excluding amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of million in  million in and million in  nonrecurring merger related expenses of million and million in and  respectively  and million of expense recognized in related to the previously discussed transfer of securities to an affiliated charitable foundation  other expense totaled million in  higher than million in and higher than million in expenses related to acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in and however  since the operating systems and support operations related to onbancorp  fnb and the former chase branches have been combined with those of the company  the company s operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations or to the company as it existed prior to each transaction 
salaries and employee benefits expense was million in  higher than the million in and higher than the million in salaries and benefits related to acquired operations  merit salary increases  higher expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and higher medical benefit costs were factors for the increase in from salaries and employee benefits related to the operations acquired from onbancorp largely contributed to the increased expense level in over merit salary increases and expenses associated with incentive compensation plans also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting the impact of these higher expenses were decreases in expense associated with stock appreciation rights of million in as compared with and million in as compared with the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  excluding one time merger related expenses  the already discussed charitable contributions expense in  and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  nonpersonnel expense totaled million in  higher than million in higher equipment and net occupancy expenses  largely attributable to the impact of the operations acquired in and  were significant factors contributing to the rise 
nonpersonnel expense was million in  after excluding amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible 
the increase in expenses from to was largely the result of expenses related to the acquired operations of onbancorp plus an increase in the amortization of capitalized servicing rights 
amortization of capitalized servicing rights totaled million in  million in and million in partially offsetting the expense increases from to was an million decline in co branded credit card rebate and other operating expenses based on card usage

international activities the company s net investment in international assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
total offshore deposits were million at december  and million at december  liquidity  market risk  and interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary  the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating expenses  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the company 
core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
as a result  and consistent with banking industry experience in general  the company has experienced a reduction in the percentage of earning assets funded by core deposits 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  brokered certificates of deposit  and borrowings from the fhlb and others 
m t bank had a credit facility with the fhlb aggregating billion at december  outstanding borrowings totaled billion at december  and billion at december  such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
m t bank and m t bank  na had available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york totaling approximately billion 
the amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at either december  or although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
these historic sources of cash flow were augmented in by the proceeds from issuance of million of trust preferred securities  which provided a substantial portion of m t s funding needs during and additional information regarding the trust preferred securities is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  of which borrowings outstanding at december  totaled million 
a similar million line of credit that expired during was entirely available for borrowing at december  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business 
furthermore  management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
as a result  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future years under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of both on and off balance sheet financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately billion  including approximately million of forward starting swaps 
information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the company s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and entering into or modifying existing interest rate swap agreements 
the accompanying table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year 
many assumptions were utilized by the company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the company s net interest income 
the more significant assumptions relate to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumed gradual changes in rates of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
as these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter these changes 
in accordance with industry practice  cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes  are presented in the accompanying table management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts  such as swaps 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee 
the notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and million and billion  respectively  at december  the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
however  the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  included in trading account assets at december  were mortgage backed securities which m t held as collateral securing certain agreements to resell securities 
the obligations to return such collateral were recorded as noninterest bearing trading account liabilities and were included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of such collateral and the related obligation to return collateral was million at december  there was no similar collateral held at december  given the company s policies  limits and positions  management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material as of december  and additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note of notes to financial statements 
capital stockholders equity at december  was billion or of total assets  compared with billion or at december  and billion or at december  on a per share basis  stockholders equity increased to at december  from at december  and was up from at december  excluding goodwill and core deposit intangible  net of applicable tax effect  tangible equity per share was at december   compared with at december  and at december  the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was  and in  and  respectively 
m t issued shares of common stock in and to complete the acquisitions of fnb and onbancorp 
on june    shares of common stock were issued to former holders of fnb common stock resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of million 
on april   m t issued  shares of common stock to former holders of onbancorp common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase  shares of m t common stock  resulting in additions to stockholders equity of million and million  respectively 
stockholders equity at december  reflected a loss of million  or per share  for the net after tax impact of unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale  compared with unrealized gains of million  or 
per common share  at december  and million  or per common share  at december  such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference  net of applicable income tax effect  between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale 
the market valuation of investment securities should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet of the company 
with the exception of investment securities classified as available for sale  trading account assets and liabilities  and residential mortgage loans held for sale  the carrying values of financial instruments in the balance sheet are generally not adjusted for appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from changes in interest rates 
cash dividends on m t s common stock of million were paid in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
in the third quarter of m t s quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to per share from per share 
in total  dividends per common share increased to in from in and in the rate of internal capital generation  or net income excluding the after tax effect of gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of average total stockholders equity  was in  in and in during  and  m t repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  shares in   shares in and  shares in  at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
in november  m t announced its intent to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   m t had repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of per share 
federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least and  respectively  of risk adjusted total assets 
in addition to the risk based measures  federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of of the quarterly average of total assets 
core capital includes the million carrying value of trust preferred securities 
as of december   total capital further included million of subordinated notes issued by m t bank in prior years 
the capital ratios of the company and its banking subsidiaries  m t bank and m t bank  na  as of december  and are presented in note of notes to financial statements 
year the year problem relates to the ability of computer systems  including those in non information technology equipment and systems computer systems  to distinguish date data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
over the past several years the company devoted resources to identify  remediate as appropriate  and test its own computer systems and to monitor and test as appropriate computer systems of entities doing business with or providing services to the company 
as a result of such efforts  the company is not aware of any significant adverse impact resulting from the failure of computer systems on which it relies to accurately process date data before or after january  nevertheless  in the company will continue to monitor its computer systems and the performance of commercial and other loan customers  funds providers  and capital market asset management counterparties for indications of year related problems 
through december   the company spent approximately million including approximately million during  million in and million in in addressing its potential year problems 
management believes that the company is continuing to devote appropriate financial and human resources to monitor its computer systems and the ongoing performance of customers and others  however  it is anticipated that additional costs related to such activities will not be significant 
a majority of the company s year related costs were internal costs and constituted resources that would otherwise have been reallocated within the company 
such reallocation did not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting will be required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
sfas no 
was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb amended sfas no 
 deferring the effective date by one year 
initial application of sfas no 
must be as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal quarter  on that date  hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the provisions of the statement 
early application of all of the provisions of sfas no 
is encouraged  but is permitted only as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after issuance of the statement 
sfas no 
may not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the manner of adoption expected to be utilized by the company has yet to be determined and  as a result  the estimated impact that adopting the provisions of sfas no 
will have on the company s financial statements has not been quantified 
the company anticipates that adoption of sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and stockholders equity and could result in the modification of certain data processing systems and hedging practices
