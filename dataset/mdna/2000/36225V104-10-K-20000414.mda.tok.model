sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives as either assets or liabilities 
it requires that an entity recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value

adoption of a common european currency on january   eleven european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors may choose to pay or to be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
on and after january   the former national currencies will cease to be legal tender 
the company is currently reviewing its information technology systems and upgrading them as necessary to ensure that they will be able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro  and process transactions and balances in euros  as required 
the company has sought and received assurances from the financial institutions with which it does business that beginning in they will be capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the former national currencies
