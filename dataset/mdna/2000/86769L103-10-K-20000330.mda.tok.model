item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures and markets laser systems for applications in ophthalmology 
substantially all of our business activities  including engineering and development  manufacturing  assembly and testing take place at our facility in fremont  california 
prior to june   we developed  manufactured and marketed lasers and air abrasion cavity preparation systems for use in dentistry 
our working capital is seriously depleted due to our substantial losses in the past eight years 
sales of our existing ophthalmic products at current levels will not be sufficient to sustain the continued development and regulatory licensing of our holmium laser corneal shaping product or process known as the laser thermal keratoplasty system the ltk system 
we have been able to raise additional working capital for all aspects of our business through private placements of our common stock and convertible notes with warrants 
these private placements raised  in  and in new equity 
we also raised approximately  in the form of promissory notes with warrants in february and march the notes placement 
we raised approximately  net of offering costs  in the form of promissory notes with warrants in january the notes placement  and approximately  net of offering costs  from the sale of common stock in december the equity offering 
in january  we raised  net of offering costs  in the form of promissory notes with warrants the notes placement 
in january  we raised approximately  net of offering costs  in the form of convertible debentures the debentures with warrants 
the company s current operations continue to be cash flow negative  further straining our working capital resources 
at our current rate of cash expenditures  we expect to need to raise additional working capital during to fund operations 
we spent approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be available on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
in the event needed additional working capital is not raised  the company has the option of scaling back its expenditures to conserve cash until such financing or alternative business solutions are implemented 
revenues the company s revenues have historically been comprised primarily of sales related to its dental products none in and  in 
revenues of  and  in and  respectively  reflect sales of its ophthalmic products 
approximately  of revenues were attributable to the dental business that was sold in june revenues for the ophthalmic business for were  gross margin gross margins were a negative  and  in and  respectively  and a positive  in the negative margin in is reflective of having no material sales during the year while incurring manufacturing costs for the development of prototype ltk instruments 
the negative gross margin in was substantially higher than that of because in we invested significantly in the development of the ltk instrument  the hyperion 
the negative gross margin was driven essentially by inventory write downs from obsolete parts and components of the sun ltk system that was being discontinued 
research and development research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in over for these expenses was driven by the investment in the development of the new ltk system  including a increase in headcount and additional consulting fees 
engineering and development expenses of  in  representing a increase from the level  were also due to development of the ltk system 
sales  marketing and regulatory sales  marketing and regulatory expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in this category of expenses in as compared to was due in part to costs associated with higher patient enrollment in clinical trials patients in compared to patients in and the expansion of clinical studies for hyperopia and presbyopia 
the most significant expenditures of the regulatory process were those relative to costs of the submission of the original pma  the preparation for the july odp meeting and the preparation of the amendments to the pma leading to the january odp meeting 
sales and marketing expenditures also increased in as compared to as we initiated the preparation of our marketing plan for product launch of the ltk system 
distribution of ltk lasers in international markets has been performed by selected distributors with the assistance of our own internal sales and marketing team 
for the us market  once we have received fda approval  we plan to sell our laser systems directly to ophthalmologists and ophthalmic laser service organizations 
we do not anticipate final fda approval before the second quarter of general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses in were in line with those of with only a increase reflecting our emphasis on keeping overhead as low as possible while making investments intended to help achieve our milestones such as fda approval and product development 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared to of approximately was  in major part  due to the non cash charges in recognition of the fair value of warrants granted to consultants in lieu of cash compensation 
this charge in amounted to approximately  of which  was a result of warrants issued in and  resulted from warrants issued in the warrants issued in were amortized over a vesting period of two years 
the warrants were fully vested in and amortized fully in that year 
an additional compensation expense of approximately  in originated from warrants granted to a consultant for his services 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of i salaries and benefits of administrative and certain executive personnel  ii product liability  officer and director liability and other corporate insurance premiums  iii accounting  legal and other fees related to patent and general corporate matters  and iv provisions for the company s allowance for bad debts and non cash expenses associated with the issuance of certain warrants and non statutory stock options 
interest income and expense interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant increase in interest income in over was due to higher average cash balances in compared to and  in interest accrued for promissory notes issued to third parties in with an average interest rate of interest 
the increase in interest income of compared to was due to higher average cash balances in compared to  maintained in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately  or  of our interest expense in was due to non cash expenses incurred in connection with the and notes placement 
the fair value of the warrants  the conversion features and the placement costs of such notes were recorded as non cash interest expense in the notes and notes bear a stated interest rate of and  respectively 
the effective rate of interest of such notes  which includes the amortization of the fair value of the warrants  is approximately and  respectively 
in  approximately  or  of the company s interest expense was due to non cash expenses incurred in connection with the and notes placement 
the fair value of the warrants  the conversion features and the placement costs of such notes were recorded as non cash interest expense in the notes and notes bear a stated interest rate of and  respectively 
the effective rate of interest of such notes  which includes the amortization of the fair value of the warrants  is approximately and  respectively 
the debenture financing will generate non cash charges over the funding period which  for purposes of recognizing the full effect of such non cash charges  could extend to the year for the full year  we anticipate a non cash charge of close to  of this amount  approximately  is a one time  non cash charge based on the difference between the debenture conversion price of and the stock market closing price for sunrise s stock of on january  in addition  the valuation of the  warrants issued with respect to the debenture financing  using black scholes valuation model  will result in an estimated non cash charge for the year of approximately  income taxes at december   and  all net deferred tax assets were computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
net losses the company reported losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the net loss in was due to minimal product revenue  under utilization of the expanded manufacturing capacity  increased marketing  sales and regulatory efforts  increased personnel costs  and non cash expenses 
the non cash expenses are associated with the amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  from the issuance of warrants and non qualified stock options to consultants in lieu of cash and approximately  associated with warrants issued in connection with the and notes placement 
the net loss in was similarly due to lower product revenues  under utilization of manufacturing capacity  non cash expenses associated with amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  warrants issued in connection with the and notes placements of approximately  and non statutory stock option expenses of approximately  which resulted from the acceleration of stock options vesting for certain former employees 
the net loss in was due also to the low level of revenues  excess manufacturing capacity and inventory  the company s continuing clinical trials for hyperopia and presbyopia  expenses associated with the company s issuance of convertible debt with warrants and certain non statutory stock options  and the company s need to maintain its basic corporate infrastructure  offset by the gain from the sale of the company s dental business in june although total operating expenses were reduced by from  the reduction was not sufficient to return the company to profitability in we expect to report net losses during the losses will come primarily from the expenses of the fda approval process  the underlying clinical studies related to the ltk system and the expenses associated with maintaining our basic corporate infrastructure 
we will not have any material domestic revenues from the ltk system product line unless and until fda approval is obtained 
on the other hand our international revenues are not projected to be sufficient to cover the expenses of maintaining the basic corporate infrastructure and our costs of the continuing clinical trials for hyperopia and presbyopia 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating activities used  in cash during and  during the same period in on january   we raised  by issuing convertible notes and accompanying warrants to purchase common stock 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at predetermined prices  bear interest at the rate of payable in kind semi annually additional convertible notes  and contain certain conversion features 
one half of the principal amount of the notes became convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share after we received conditional approval from the odp for the ltk system 
the investor will also be required to convert the remaining portion of the notes into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share on the date the company receives fda approval to market the ltk system in the united states 
substantial portions of the and losses were funded with the proceeds from the sale of our dental business in june and from a series of private placements and equity offerings 
the notes placement and notes placement had aggregate net proceeds of approximately  gross proceeds of  and  respectively 
on december   we completed a private placement of approximately  in shares of common stock 
the subscription price was per share  which represents a discount from the average of the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market system  on each of the last ten consecutive nasdaq national market system trading days in october of the total proceeds   from the equity offering was received in the form of promissory notes due on march  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
of the  in promissory notes   is currently outstanding and has not been repaid 
the company s debt service obligations consist of interest  payable in cash or in kind  accruing at a rate of per annum on the  in principal and interest on the notes as of december   and per annum on the  of principal and interest on the notes as of december  the company also pays  per month on leases for computer and office equipment 
the warrants issued in connection with the notes placement and notes placement had a fair value of approximately and per warrant  respectively  at the time of issuance 
the fair value of these warrants has been reflected as additional consideration for the convertible notes  recorded as a discount on the debt and accreted as interest expense to be amortized over the life of the convertible notes 
this amortization of interest expense associated with the warrants will reduce net income through the term of the and notes  but will have no effect on future cash flows from operations 
our current operations continue to be cash flow negative  limiting our working capital resources 
working capital at december  amounted to approximately  in january we raised an additional  net of closing costs 
our existing cash resources  as supplemented by these proceeds  may not be sufficient to fund our year activities 
at the company s current rate of cash expenditures  it is likely that we may need to raise additional working capital during at december   working capital amounted to approximately  the company spent approximately  for capital expenditures in calendar year and expects to spend more than that amount for capital expenditures in fiscal year we expect our expenses to increase in due to the ramp up to manufacture initial production units of our ltk system and the preparation costs associated with the anticipated market launch of the ltk system 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be available on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders 
in the event needed additional working capital is not raised  the company has the option of scaling back its expenditures to conserve cash until such financing or alternative business solutions are implemented 
conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the member countries of the european union have adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legal currencies and the euro were established 
the legal currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january  but not later than july  
during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legal currency 
we do not expect the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations since the majority of our business transactions are recorded in us currency

sab provides guidance for revenue recognition under certain circumstances 
the company believes that sab will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities or its debt instruments 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments and does not transact business in foreign currencies 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed
