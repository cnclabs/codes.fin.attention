uncertainty regarding industry trends and customer demand 
as a result of the slowdown in the construction of power plants and the absence of new power plants scheduled for construction  as well as the gradual deregulation of the production and distribution of electricity  the market for engineering services relating to licensing and construction of power plants has contracted  and the market for services related to efficient and profitable operation of existing capacity has expanded 
there can be no assurance that i tenera will have the financial and other resources necessary to successfully research  develop  introduce  and market new products and services  ii if  or when  such new products or services are introduced  they will be favorably accepted by current or potential customers  or iii tenera will be otherwise able to fully adjust its services and products to meet the changing needs of the industry see item  business background 
uncertainty of access to capital 
management currently believes that cash expected to be generated from operations  the company s working capital  and its available loan facility  are adequate to meet its anticipated near term needs 
if cash from operations is less than currently anticipated  tenera may need to seek other sources of capital 
there can be no guarantee that such sources will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms favorable to tenera  or at all 
reliance on key personnel 
due to the nature of the consulting and professional services business  the company s success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of its officers and key technical personnel and the ability to recruit additional qualified personnel 
the company experienced a historically high rate of turnover as revenue and earnings began to decline in and thereafter 
further loss of such officers and technical personnel  and the inability to recruit sufficient additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company

competition 
the market for management and consulting services is highly competitive and tenera competes with several larger firms with significantly greater resources 
significant competitive factors in the market for engineering and management services are price and the ability to offer new products and services designed to meet changing customer demand 
a number of tenera s competitors are able to offer such services at prices that are lower than those offered by tenera  and to devote far greater resources toward the development of new products and services 
this competition has had  and is expected to continue to have  a material adverse impact on tenera s business 
year issue 
the company has corrected its known internal year system problems and has received notification from key vendors and clients that their systems are year compliant 
furthermore  the company has not experienced any material problems subsequent to the date change 
however  the company has no control over the systems of third parties and it is possible that year problems may occur at a later date  which could materially affect the company s business operations and financial condition 
for example  if a major client has a year problem with its accounts payable system  payment of the company s invoices could be delayed  adversely affecting cash flow
