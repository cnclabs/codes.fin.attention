item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational changes integrated graphics segment the integrated graphics segment is made up of a nationwide network of commercial print facilities and the direct response division which specializes in variable imaging and print on demand products used in the promotional printing market 
the principal products and services supplied by the integrated graphics segment include the design and manufacture of high color  high quality marketing and promotional materials  and the manufacture of direct response printing materials 
during fiscal and  the company took decisive action to divest non compatible product lines  expand geographic coverage and close under performing facilities 
the company significantly increased its commitment to high color marketing and promotional printing in the second quarter of fiscal with the acquisition of graphic industries  inc graphic 
in fiscal  the company made several operational decisions that affected this segment 
in the third quarter  the company announced a restructuring that included closing three under performing plants in this segment by fiscal year end 
two of these plants were acquired as part of the graphic acquisition 
also in fiscal  the company acquired a small regional commercial printing operation in the midwestern united states  and sold quadras  a design concern that was part of the graphic acquisition 
in fiscal  the company acquired a commercial printing operation which expanded its commercial printing network to the west coast of the united states  and divested mercury printing  also part of the graphic acquisition 
forms and labels segment the principal products and services supplied by the forms and labels segment included the design  manufacture and sale of both paper based and electronic business forms  the manufacture of both electronic data processing edp labels and prime labels  and the manufacture and distribution of a standard line of office products 
as a result of the restructuring in fiscal  one multiple use plant in lebanon  kentucky was closed in the fourth quarter with its production being shifted to other company facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired a small prime label company 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company divested the operations of visible computer supply  a contract stationers business that did not fit with the long term strategic direction of the company 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal revenue net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal pro forma sales growth  after adjusting for acquisitions  divestitures and closures is approximately 
the breakdown of sales for fiscal within the two business segments was as follows business segment of total revenue revenue increase integrated graphics forms and labels item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  the forms and labels segment grew and the integrated graphics segment grew 
over the last five years  sales have grown at a compound annual rate of  with most of the growth coming from acquisitions 
it is estimated that year over year unit growth in the forms and labels segment was to  while the integrated graphics segment remained unchanged 
the company s sales strategy can be broken into two components 
the primary driving force for sales growth is the company s total print management tpm strategy 
the objective of tpm is to provide all types of printed material produced by both segments to major contract customers  with the primary focus being fortune companies 
this is accomplished by the national direct sales force  which sells all of the company s product offerings 
contract sales before divestitures have grown over the prior year 
contract sales for the forms and labels segment again before divestitures were up whereas contract sales for the integrated graphics segment were up 
the second key component of the sales strategy is the continued success in capturing the local transactional business 
this is especially important in the integrated graphic s segment  where a local sales force captures order by order business in its local market 
the national direct sales force also sells directly on an order by order basis 
the company has hired a number of experienced sales representatives in order to recapture market share of transactional business 
adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures  this non contract business grew  with growth coming from both segments 
paper is the basic raw material for of the company s products 
in the forms and labels segment  paper represents approximately of sales 
in the integrated graphics segment  paper represents approximately of sales 
the majority of paper used by the company comes from three paper grades uncoated free sheet  tablet and offset 
using pound uncoated free sheet as a proxy for the paper market  published prices during the last two years have increased steadily 
after increasing from january  to july   prices continued to increase in fiscal  being up an additional by the end of fiscal the company continues to reduce its exposure to this volatility in the paper market 
contracts signed as part of the tpm program contain provisions to increase or decrease sell prices in line with announced paper price changes 
additionally  the continual shift toward high color marketing and promotional printing  as well as growth in digital print and market to one programs further mitigates the overall impact of paper on operating margins 
products in the integrated graphics segment have a higher component of value added labor  and thus rely less on the sale of paper 
the company continues to grow revenue by exploring new business lines 
in fiscal  the company entered into a licensing agreement to produce security labels 
the company used its extensive printing know how to develop a proprietary method of manufacturing a product not normally associated with a printing operation 
this type of niche market represents an opportunity to increase revenue in the more profitable label business 
additionally  the company s exceptional systems  service delivery  and distribution capabilities have allowed the company to increase its emphasis on services as part of its product offering 
currently  services such as inventory control and product distribution are sold with the printed product the company provides 
the company believes inventory and distribution services  along with kitting  custom programming  and sourcing of non printed goods can be sold independently of the printed product and offer an opportunity for revenue growth 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent to sales for fiscal was versus in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was seen in both segments of the business 
this trend  however  was more pronounced in the forms and labels segment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued in the integrated graphics segment  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
this increase is largely attributable to competitive market conditions predominantly in the eastern and southeastern united states 
the increase in cost of goods sold in those regions was partially offset by a decrease in direct response cost of goods sold 
the direct response division has increased its sales in market to one product  which has a lower cost of sales due to lower paper content 
this value added variable imaging is the new focal point of the division  which had previously been targeting the mass mailer market 
the company believes that margins can be expanded in the integrated graphics segment by continuing to increase contract sales which will increase equipment utilization 
in the forms and labels segment  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
seventy basis points of the increase is related to an unfavorable change in lifo expense  which was million in fiscal versus million of income in fiscal the lifo charge was the result of higher prices on grades of paper primarily used in this segment 
a portion of the increased cost of goods sold is due to the delay in passing paper price increases along to customers because of pricing constraints within customers contracts 
for product sold under contract  there is usually a to day lag between the time of a paper price change and its effect on net sales and  ultimately  on gross margin 
the company is also experiencing gross margin compression as a result of ongoing competition 
due to changes in technology  the business forms market has continued to decline 
forms manufacturers are forced to compete for a share of the shrinking market which has resulted in lower overall selling prices 
competitive pressures in the forms industry have compelled many forms manufacturers to move into the growing label market 
this shift has brought price competition into this arena as well 
the company continually looks for niche markets to continue to expand revenue and margins in the label market 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in fiscal versus in fiscal several one time charges recorded in the second and third quarters have significantly impacted this category 
charges related to executive retirement benefits and other costs related to management changes totalled million 
additional charges of million included an adjustment to the reserve for post retirement medical costs of million that arose from a change in actuarial assumptions utilized to estimate the benefit  and million related to an adverse judgment in an arbitration proceeding arising from a contractual obligation of graphic industries 
without these one time charges  selling and administrative expenses would have been of sales 
while the total fiscal expense ratio exceeded fiscal  the fourth quarter was of sales 
the fourth quarter benefited significantly from the restructuring and other cost saving initiatives 
the company expects that selling and administrative expenses will decrease from fiscal levels before one time charges 
there were no yk related software expenses in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization the provision for depreciation and amortization was of sales in fiscal and in fiscal the current year s total includes million of goodwill amortization which is consistent with prior year s level 
software amortization increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal most of the increase is related to amortization of a million system enhancement project which began in fiscal and is being implemented in phases 
this project will be completed in the first half of fiscal  when the remainder of the cost will begin to be amortized 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring plan and undertook initiatives to reduce the overall cost base of the company 
the fiscal year results include a pretax charge of million related to the restructuring plan 
the company implemented the restructuring program because of continued softness in the high quality color marketing and promotional printing market  along with other issues relating to the integration of the graphic industries acquisition 
management reviewed its operations and developed action plans relating to both segments that dealt with under performing facilities  underutilized assets  and rationalization of certain product lines 
the charge includes the write off of goodwill associated with plants that were closed  the write off of abandoned software  the write down to net realizable value of property and equipment to be sold  and severance and outplacement costs 
the amount of allocated goodwill written off related to plants acquired in the graphics acquisition 
the majority of the restructuring activity  and related charges  occurred in the third quarter 
while the restructuring is substantially complete  the company will continue to adjust the reserve account  if necessary  in fiscal looking forward  the company believes the restructuring will generate savings in both cost of goods sold and selling and administrative costs which should increase company profitability 
the company is continually looking for ways to reduce its overall cost base 
interest expense net interest expense for fiscal increased million over fiscal the increase is mostly from higher interest rates on variable rate debt  along with additional incremental interest expense resulting from the issuance of million of fixed rate bonds in the second quarter of fiscal in which the proceeds were used to pay down variable rate debt 
the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates during fiscal does not have a significant impact on total interest expense for the company 
other income other income includes a one time credit of million which was recorded in the third quarter and represents the proceeds received from the sale of stock that the company received in john hancock s conversion from a policyholder owned company to a stockholder based company 
the company received shares in relation to the amount of corporate owned life insurance policies held with john hancock 
this item was considered a one time charge in the fiscal results 
income taxes due primarily to the restructuring charges  a portion of which is not deductible  the current year effective tax rate was 
the tax rate in fiscal was 
the company projects an effective rate for fiscal of approximately 
year the company s effort to address year compliance issues included i evaluating internal computing infrastructure  business applications and production systems for year compliance  and ii replacing or remediating systems and applications as necessary to assure such compliance 
the company s effort in these respects was completed as of december  substantially all of the company s software  firmware  hardware including embedded chips and equipment used in its printing operations  including its pre press and press equipment and its equipment used to finish and deliver its products  were not materially affected by a year related failure 
also  the company did not experience any year related problems caused by key suppliers or customers whose systems interact with those of the company 
in addition  the company did not experience any year related failure caused by utility companies  telecommunication services providers  delivery services  the financial services industry and other suppliers outside of its control 
the passing of december  and other high risk dates ie february  with no major negative impact from a national standpoint mitigates the risk of any future major year related disruptions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued net income and net income per share net income for the year decreased by million  or  to million or 
per share 
before the restructuring charge of million other one time charges net of credits of million  and a tax rate consistent with fiscal of  net income would have been million higher and earnings per share would have been higher 
fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal several acquisitions and divestitures discussed in the operational changes section at the beginning of the management s discussion and analysis affected the results 
pro forma sales growth after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures was 
the breakdown of net sales for fiscal within the company s two business segments was as follows business segment of total revenue revenue increase integrated graphics forms and labels after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  the forms and labels segment grew and the integrated graphics segment grew 
over the last five years  sales have grown at a compound annual rate of  with most of the growth coming from acquisitions 
a significant portion of the increased sales in the integrated graphics segment were generated by the national direct sales force  which began selling high color marketing and promotional printing shortly after the acquisition 
products sold by the national direct sales force that were manufactured in the graphic facilities increased tenfold from fiscal to fiscal based upon a fourth quarter run rate of million  this was equivalent to of graphic industries sales in the twelve months prior to acquisition 
the company estimates year over year unit growth in both the forms and labels segment  and the integrated graphics segment to be around 
paper price changes have a material effect on the company s reported sales dollars and operating results 
prices on pound white uncoated free sheet rose over from the spring of to november  then fell more that by the end of fiscal after remaining steady for the first half of fiscal  the published prices increased by from january  to july  the company has continued to reduce its exposure to this volatility 
the product mix shift to high color and promotional printing helps to mitigate the overall impact of paper on operating margins 
in the second quarter of the fiscal the company divested its contract stationer business  which had annual revenues of approximately million  because it did not fit with the long term strategic objectives of the company 
in conjunction with the sale of this business to boise cascade office products bcop  the company expanded its alliance with bcop in order to better serve the needs of its customers 
as the margins on this type of product are generally lower  exiting this business had the impact of increasing operating margins in the forms and labels segment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued with the company s total print management strategy  more sales are occurring under contract 
nonetheless  the majority of the sales in the integrated graphics segment are made on an order by order basis 
selling prices in this segment  therefore  reflect market conditions for paper more immediately than in the forms and labels segment 
the impact of lower paper prices reduced sales by about for fiscal  however  this was more than offset by unit growth and acquisitions 
net income for the year increased by million or 
the after tax ratio for fiscal was 
for the last five years  net income has grown at an average compound rate of 
cost of goods sold as a percent to sales for fiscal was versus in fiscal integrated graphics has higher cost of goods sold as a percent to sales than the forms and labels segment 
that fact  coupled with the extra quarter of operating results for graphic and the faster growth in the integrated graphics segment  was the most significant element contributing to the increase 
the company views margin expansion in the integrated graphics segment as a significant opportunity  as contract business for high color marketing and promotional printing accelerates 
the lifo impact year over year was comparable 
selling and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were in fiscal and in fiscal it had been anticipated that these expenses as a percent to sales would decrease in fiscal as the company leveraged its national sales force  systems  and shared services across a broader sales base 
year related software expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating income decreased from of sales in fiscal to in fiscal the most significant reason for the drop in operating income as a percent to sales was the anticipated shift in product mix between the segments 
the integrated graphics segment had a full year of graphic results in fiscal versus only three quarters in fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased by million due primarily to incurring four full quarters of interest expense in fiscal related to the graphic acquisition versus only three quarters in fiscal also  interest rates were higher due to fixing million of debt in long term notes 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was versus in fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
as a result of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 the company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal based on current circumstances  the company does not believe that application of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued in july the emerging issue task force of the financial accounting standards board task force issued eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
this pronouncement provides new requirements on how to account for revenues collected from customers to reimburse the seller for shipping and handling costs 
however  no guidance has been given on how to account for the corresponding freight costs paid by the seller 
the company will be required to report amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  as revenue in the income statement 
although we believe this pronouncement will have no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations  this pronouncement may have a significant impact on individual lines within the income statement including sales and possibly cost of sales 
the company currently aggregates shipping and handling costs and revenues in the revenue line on the income statement 
this statement requires retroactive restatement and will be adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal in may the task force issued eitf issue  accounting for certain sales incentives  which addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that a company offers to its customers for use in a single exchange transaction 
based upon current circumstances  the company does not believe that application of eitf issue will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital working capital decreased million to million as of july  the company has increased its focus on the balance sheet  specifically working capital  in order to generate cash to pay down debt 
while actual balances have increased in both accounts receivable and inventory  days sales outstanding has improved by three days and inventory turns have increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company will continue to focus on working capital management 
the current ratio at july  was capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal were million 
there were no major construction projects in process at fiscal year end 
in addition to capital expenditures  the company continues to invest in its information technology infrastructure 
information systems expenditures of million have been capitalized in fiscal the company is at the end of its most aggressive systems initiatives to date 
the first two phases of the project are complete and the final phase of the project will be implemented by the end of the second quarter of fiscal over the last five years  capital expenditures have totaled million 
these expenditures were funded through internally generated funds 
over the past five years  the company also spent million for software development 
for fiscal year  it is estimated that capital expenditures will be approximately million 
capital expenditures are expected to be lower than historical rates in fiscal as the company has reallocated assets as part of its restructuring plan 
capitalized software will also decrease significantly as the major systems initiative winds down 
debt in fiscal  total debt decreased million to million 
strong cash flows from operations have made it possible to repurchase common stock while reducing the ratio of debt to total capitalization from at july  to at july  several significant events affected the debt level during the year 
during item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued fiscal  the company purchased million of its common stock in open market transactions at an average price of 
company owned life insurance policies totaling million were surrendered in the second half of the year  with proceeds being used to reduce debt 
of the outstanding debt as of july   million has been borrowed under a five year credit agreement credit facility  which provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount available to be borrowed of million 
on january   the company offered million of senior notes  and at that time  incurred an million settlement on the treasury rate lock agreement related to the issuance of the senior notes 
the proceeds of the note issue were used to pay down borrowings under the credit facility 
the borrowings under the credit facility are classified as long term debt since the company has the intent and ability to carry that debt long term 
in addition to the credit facility  the company has unsecured money market lines of million  under which million was borrowed at july  the million from the unsecured money market lines is classified as short term debt 
the maximum amount as authorized by the board of directors for total borrowings is currently million 
in fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration to issue up to million of unsecured debt and equity securities 
the million in senior notes issued in fiscal reduced the amount available under the shelf registration to million 
the company has a bbb rating from standard poor s and a baa rating from moody s for both the million universal shelf registration and the million revolving credit facility 
as a result of the earnings warning issued by the company in january  both rating agencies placed the company on credit watch 
after completing their reviews  moody s reaffirmed its baa rating  and standard poor s lowered its rating from bbb to bbb 
both agencies have subsequently removed the company from credit watch and placed the company on stable outlook 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
as of july   of total debt is fixed rate debt 
the company believes that it has adequate financing and cash flows to make acquisitions  repurchase stock  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and pay down debt during fiscal while maintaining its investment grade ratings 
over the coming year  strong cash flows should reduce leverage from the current to a targeted mid level 
common stock dividends were raised for the th consecutive year in september to per share  an increase of 
during fiscal   shares of common stock were issued in connection with the company s employee stock purchase plan and the and stock option plans 
also during the year  deferred bonus amounts were placed into a grantor trust for the benefit of certain executives 
while these shares are accounted for as treasury stock  they are considered outstanding and incorporated in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
the balance of million of deferred compensation in the equity section of the balance sheet reflects the total fixed liability that the  trust shares represent 
the company also repurchased  shares during the year under the million share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may those repurchases bring the total purchases made under this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued program to million 
in january the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional million of stock 
in the short term  the company only intends to repurchase shares to the extent necessary to offset the dilutive effects of shares issued pursuant to employee benefit plans 
the treasury shares can be used for future acquisitions or for employee benefit plans 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and relatively fragmented  with a large number of competitors 
some of the company s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial  marketing and technical resources 
the company has invested significant resources in computer technology and distribution facilities in an attempt to differentiate itself from certain of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not take actions  including developing new technologies  products and services  which could adversely affect the company s sales and operating results 
dependence on key personnel the company s performance depends in large part on the continued service of its key sales and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute the company s strategy is often lengthy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain such personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results or financial condition
