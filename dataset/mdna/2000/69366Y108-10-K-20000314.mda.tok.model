item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as percentages of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income non operating expenses income before income taxes and extraordinary loss income tax expense benefit income before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss on debt prepayments net income we posted record net sales in  rising from to and from to our acquisition of pwpipe in september  as well as higher volumes of pipe sold  primarily due to increased demand and production capacities  and increasing pipe prices due to strong demand and increasing raw material prices  were responsible for the growth in revenues 
pipe pounds sold rose by from to  and pipe prices increased by during the same period 
revenue growth from to was due primarily to higher volumes of pipe sold due to increased demand and production capacities 
pounds sold rose by from to these higher volumes in were partially offset by lower selling prices  which decreased from to the lower selling prices were caused by increased competition and lower pvc resin prices 
the increase in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  from to is primarily due to a combination of strong demand for pipe  rising resin and pipe prices in  and significant capacity and process improvement investments we made during the past two years being deployed in pvc resin prices increased due to a strong demand for resin and increasing raw material costs 
strong demand for pipe allowed us to increase pipe prices at a rate greater than resin price increases 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to is primarily due to a combination of strong demand for pipe and decreasing resin prices in pvc resin prices decreased due to excess production capacity in north america and depressed asian markets 
strong demand for pipe prevented pipe prices from dropping as fast as resin prices 
the decrease in operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  from to is the result of increased sales in combination with certain fixed operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  from to is primarily due to additional freight costs from increased sales volume combined with lower selling prices 
the increase in non operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  from to is due to the 
million and million charges incurred in the third and first quarters of  respectively  as a result of the terminated acquisition costs incurred in connection with our prior agreements to acquire the pvc pipe business of the lamson sessions co 
and merge with a company wholly owned by condea vista company discussed in more detail in note to the financial statements 
the decrease in non operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  from to  which consists principally of interest expense  is primarily due to the issuance of million of redeemable preferred stock in may of the proceeds from the preferred stock were used to pay down our revolving credit line 
in the quarters ended june  and september   we reversed approximately million and million  respectively  of valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax asset relating to the net operating loss carryforwards 
the reversals  totaling million  were based on updated expectations about future years taxable income to reflect continuing improvements in operating results influenced by our added production capacity  and other indications that certain concerns that had previously limited management s expectations about future taxable income no longer applied 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a the portion of the decrease in valuation allowance related to a change in estimate of future years income is accounted for as a discrete event in the period the change in estimate occurred and b the portion of the decrease in the valuation allowance related to a change of estimate of the current year income is recorded over the remainder of the current year through elimination of the valuation allowance and a similar amount of the deferred tax asset as income is earned 
accordingly  a the adjustment to the valuation allowance described above was accounted for discretely in the quarters they were made and b our federal effective tax rate for the remainder of  excluding the discrete adjustments and the matter described in the following sentences  was zero 
the deferred tax expense recognized in the quarter ended december   is primarily the result of the earnings of the acquired pwpipe business 
beginning with the first quarter of  we expect our overall effective tax rate will approximate 
the net income available to common stockholders for the three months and for the year ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively  higher than it would have been if we had recorded our income tax provision at  which is the expected overall tax rate to be recorded in future periods 
this difference is principally the result of the accounting for our net operating loss carryforwards in as discussed in the preceding paragraph 
supplemental discussion and analysis of pro forma results of operations the following is a supplemental discussion and analysis of our pro forma results of operations as of december   compared with the pro forma results of operations for december   as if our acquisition had occurred on january  the pro forma results may not be indicative of results that actually would have occurred had our acquisition taken place at the beginning of the period presented or of results which may occur in the future 
the following table sets forth our selected pro forma operating statement data in thousands  except for per share amounts net sales   cost of goods sold   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income   interest expense   other expense  income before income taxes  income tax expense  net income  eps basic 
diluted 
average shares basic   diluted   in percentages net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income the principal factors underlying the changes and trends set forth above in the pro forma results of operations information are consistent with our historic operation information discussed on pages and  largely accentuated by an increase in pounds sold of in over this is primarily a result of the strong economy in the western united states and its influence on the construction industry and its suppliers 
in addition  selling prices have increased due to increases in the price of pvc resin and strong demand for finished goods  and we have realized the result of significant capacity and process improvement investments made by both eagle and pwpipe over the last two years being deployed in the pro forma results of operations reflect a pro forma interest expense at rates that approximate that which we would have experienced on pro forma debt levels that would have been outstanding over the pro forma periods 
the pro forma results do not reflect any anticipated cost savings or any synergies that are anticipated from our acquisition of pwpipe  and there can be no assurance that any such cost savings or synergies will occur 
had our acquisition been consummated on january   we believe the valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets for our net operating loss carryforwards would have been decreased at that date as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition 
accordingly  the pro forma results of operations reflect a consistent pro forma overall effective income tax rate of 
included in the unaudited historical and pro forma net income and earnings per share information are certain nonrecurring charges  as noted in note to the financial statements  associated with our acquisition of pwpipe and our proposed acquisitions which were terminated earlier in fiscal these nonrecurring items reduce historical and proforma income before tax by approximately million 
absent these nonrecurring charges  pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share would be approximately and  respectively 
included in the pro forma net income and earnings per share information is a million fair market value purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory which was reflected in the earliest pro forma period presented 
absent this charge  pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share would be approximately 
and 
for  respectively 
financial condition we had working capital of million at december  as of december   we had available excess borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
cash generated from operating activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
profits and depreciation and amortization were the primary sources of net cash provided by operating activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased inventory to replenish inventories utilized in the second and third quarters 
we normally build inventory in the first and fourth quarters and draw down inventory in the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of the business 
this inventory build was larger than previous years due to the acquisition of pwpipe in the third quarter of and the necessity to build inventory for a larger company 
this increase in inventory utilized approximately million of cash generated by operations and the revolving credit facility 
we used million  million  and million for investing activities in   and  respectively 
the primary use of cash in was for our acquisition of pwpipe 
the primary use of cash in and was for capital expenditures for the addition and replacement of manufacturing equipment and the construction of the new manufacturing facility in utah 
cash provided by financing activities was million in the primary source of cash in was borrowings under the senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes for the pwpipe acquisition 
we had commitments for capital expenditures of million at december   which will be funded from operating profits 
additional sources of liquidity  if needed  may include our revolving credit line  additional long term debt financing  and the sale of our equity securities under either a private or public offering 
we believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our current and future business requirements  including capital expenditures for expanding manufacturing capacity and working capital requirements 
on july   lamson sessions co 
filed a complaint against us to recover alleged damages incurred by lamson in connection with the termination of our proposed acquisition of lamson s pvc pipe business 
as set forth in the complaint  lamson is seeking nearly million in fees and expenses  plus an undetermined amount of damages 
although this matter is at an early stage  we believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
we have accrued  of estimated costs to be incurred associated with the disposition of this matter 
effective september   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of pwpipe  a manufacturer of pvc pipe and fittings 
pwpipe operated six manufacturing facilities located in tacoma and sunnyside  washington  eugene  oregon  and cameron park  perris and visalia  california  from its operating headquarters in eugene  oregon 
we paid approximately million  including transaction costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an expense of  for severance costs related to the elimination of redundant positions following the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of pwpipe  on september   we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement to obtain a million senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility consists of a i term note a in the principal amount of million  ii term note b in the principal amount of million  and a iii million revolving credit facility million  as amended on march  
the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all our assets 
term note a bears interest at a rate equal to the libor plus 
term note b bears interest at a rate equal to the libor plus 
the libor rate at december  was 
in november  under covenants of our senior credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for three years with a libor rate of for one half of the outstanding principal of term loan a and term loan b 
principal on the term notes is due and payable quarterly in million installments beginning on december   and continuing on the last day of each march  june  september and december thereafter until paid in full on september  outstanding notes issued pursuant to the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to the libor plus 
we are required to pay a fee equal to of the unused portion of the revolving facility 
also on september   we issued senior subordinated notes totaling million million recorded amount  net of debt discount described below with detachable stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable at a fixed rate per annum equal to beginning on december   and on the th day of each march  june  september and december thereafter until the entire principal and interest is paid in full on september  of this interest  is payable in cash and an additional accrues annually 
principal is paid in three equal installments on each september th of  and a debt discount totaling million has been recorded associated with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  based on the collective estimated fair value of the senior subordinated notes and warrants on the date of issue 
the discount is being amortized using an interest method as a yield adjustment over their term 
the various debt agreements set forth certain financial covenants  which require  among other things  that we maintain certain levels of net worth and ratios of financial condition  limit capital expenditures  and restrict our payment of dividends 
as described below  in connection with our acquisition of pwpipe  we entered into various equity transactions with certain officers and directors 
we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at fair market value  issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock and granted incentive stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
in the third and fourth quarters of  restricted stock grants were made to certain officers of the company 
these shares carry dividend and voting rights 
sales of these shares are restricted prior to the date of vesting 
the shares vest after three years  after four years  and the remaining after five years from the date of grant 
the restricted stock is subject to an agreement requiring forfeiture by the officer in the event of termination of employment prior to the vesting date for reason other than normal retirement  death or disability 
shares issued were recorded at the market price on the date of grant  with the corresponding deferred charge as part of shareholders equity 
the deferred charge is being amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the related vesting period 
as of december    shares of restricted stock were outstanding 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook and year yk compliance sections and statements contained in items  and  regarding our beliefs and expectations  including statements regarding litigation matters  are based on our current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially from our current expectations 
we expect the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for plastic pipe of three percent or greater per year through we have historically been able to  and expect in the future to be able to  grow at rates in excess of the industry averages due to our emphasis on customer satisfaction and product quality 
our strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
our gross margin percentage is sensitive to pvc and pe raw material resin prices and the demand for pvc and pe pipe 
historically when resin prices are rising or stable  our margins and sales volume have been higher and when resin prices are falling  our sales volumes and margins have been lower 
gross margins also suffer when the supply of pvc and pe pipe increases faster than demand 
we believe that supply and demand in the plastic pipe industry is currently balanced 
we also believe that pvc resin demand will be greater than pvc resin supply in the year and that there may be shortages of pvc resin 
due to the commodity nature of pvc and pe resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or assume that historical trends will continue 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  including significant net operating loss carryforwards nols 
the net deferred tax asset represents management s best estimate of the tax benefits that will more likely than not be realized in future years at each reporting date 
however  there can be no assurance that we can generate taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset 
in addition  under the tax reform act of  certain future changes in ownership resulting from the sale of stock may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized on an annual basis 
we have and will continue to evaluate compliance relating to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  and believe we have complied in all respects 
a failure to meet the requirements could result in a loss or limitation of the utilization of carryforwards  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
the statements contained in this outlook and year yk compliance sections and statements contained in items  and regarding our beliefs and expectations  including statements regarding litigation matters  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  raw material cost and supply fluctuations  lower than expected economic growth  competition  availability of working capital and adverse weather conditions 
year yk compliance as with other organizations  our computer hardware and software were originally designed to recognize calendar years by their last two digits 
calculations performed using these truncated fields would not work properly with dates from the year and beyond 
we completed an assessment of our information and manufacturing systems and completed the necessary changes on these systems to make them yk compliant 
we have not experienced any disruption to our business as a result of yk issues 
in addition  we are not aware of any business disruption related to major vendors or customers as a result of their non compliance with yk issues 
however  we may experience problems associated with yk issues that have not yet been discovered 
we are continuing to monitor our information and manufacturing systems and transactions with vendors and customers for any indications of yk issues 
as of december   the total cost associated with the modification to be yk compliant was approximately  which was expensed as incurred 
most pwpipe system platforms were acquired over the last months and are yk compliant 
we believe this to be the total cost necessary to be yk compliant  however  there can be no assurance that final costs will not exceed this level 
accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we believe implementation of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on earnings and on our financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks on outstanding interest rate long term debt obligations totaling million  of our million of long term variable rate debt at december  market risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates which would result in an annual interest expense increase of approximately  we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we only enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest on our credit facility 
in november  under covenants of our senior credit facility  we entered into a fixed rate lock agreement the contract for three years with a libor rate of 
the contract has a notional amount of million
