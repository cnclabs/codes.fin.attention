designer holdings acquisition prior to its acquisition by the company  designer holdings experienced substantial sales growth 
a significant portion of this sales growth was achieved through distribution to jobbers and off price retailers 
additionally  designer holdings had also announced a significant increase in the number of its outlet stores 
the company viewed this growth and expansion as detrimental to the long term integrity and value of the brand 
to sustain its growth strategy  designer holdings committed to large quantities of inventories 
when the primary department store distribution channel was unable to absorb all of designer holdings committed production  it increased sales to the secondary and tertiary distribution channels  including sales to jobbers  off price retailers and designer holdings own outlet stores  which were expanded to serve as an additional channel of distribution 
the company s post acquisition strategy did not embrace the outlet store expansion or expansion of secondary channels of distribution  thereby significantly eliminating product distribution  resulting in excess inventory 
the company had a different plan from that of designer holdings for realization of inventories and accounts receivable  as follows based upon its strategy for the business  it had to quickly dispose of significantly higher than desirable levels of inventory 
it had to stabilize relationships with its core department store customers 
it had to collect receivable balances from customers with whom the company would no longer do business  and had to respond to challenges from the core department store customers who were adversely impacted by channel conflict and brand image issues 
finally  the company began a complete redesign of the product  the impact of which would not be immediately felt at retail due to the fact that designer holdings had already committed to inventory that was in production to be delivered for the ensuing seasons 
the consequences related not only to the receivables and inventory acquired  but also to the design  fabric and inventory purchases to which designer holdings had previously committed 
immediately following the acquisition  the company began quickly liquidating excess inventories 
most of these sales were below original cost 
not only did the company fail to recover cost including royalties payable to the licensor  it was deprived of the reasonable gross profit contemplated by apb opinion in valuing acquired inventory 
accordingly  the company reduced the historical carrying value of inventory by million 
the million fair value adjustment recorded addressed all of these issues and represented the fair value of inventory pursuant to apb opinion the company offered significant discounts by negotiating settlements on a customer by customer basis to collect outstanding receivable balances in light of product related issues raised  as well as the decision to discontinue certain channels of distribution  realizing that these balances would become increasingly more difficult to collect with the passage of time 
in addition  the core retail customers took substantial deductions against current invoices for the designer holdings inventory in the stores  unilaterally revising the economics of the initial sale transaction entered into by designer holdings 
although these deductions relate to both the inventory acquired and pre acquisition accounts receivable  the decrease in asset value manifested itself through accounts receivable as a result of these deductions 
accordingly  the company reduced the historical carrying value of accounts receivable by million 
the million fair value adjustment  which was recorded pursuant to apb opinion  addresses these issues 
the company believes that these strategies should enhance future results of operations and cash flows  however  these fair value adjustments will result in additional annual goodwill amortization of approximately million
