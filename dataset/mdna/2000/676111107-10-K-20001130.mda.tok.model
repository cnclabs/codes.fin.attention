overview this section provides information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page fiscal contained weeks compared to weeks in both fiscal and we do not consider the impact of the additional week to be material to the overall operations for the year 
the operating results and other financial information discussed below includes the results of fresh samantha since the acquisition was completed on may  general business net sales in fiscal increased to million  an increase of from million of sales last year  which represents a record sales year for odwalla 
in fiscal  we acquired fresh samantha on may   experienced growth in all of our geographic market areas  and expanded our presence in markets we entered in prior years 
before considering the preferred stock dividend  our net income for the year was million or per share compared to a loss of million or 
per share last year 
before considering the insurance settlement proceeds  net of tax  the cost of converting the series a preferred stock and the preferred stock dividend  net income for fiscal was  or per basic share and per diluted share 
overall  the year represented a return to profitability for odwalla 
before considering the impact of the fresh samantha acquisition  our sales strength this year has come predominantly from continued penetration in existing markets and sales of new products 
we believe that continued recognition of the odwalla and samantha brand and consumer attraction to our products  new product introductions  better store shelves placement  increased placement of branded in store coolers  and increased delivery system support has contributed to our sales growth 
we experience quarterly fluctuations in sales and costs  particularly in raw materials  which are sometimes significant and we anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in future quarters 
some factors behind the fluctuations include changes in the price or availability of raw materials  particularly fruit products  due to seasonality  weather and other factors  new product introductions  costs of expansion into new markets  which can continue for many quarters beyond the market entry date  increased competition  sales promotions  buying patterns of consumers  competitor product introductions  overall economic trends influencing consumers 
in addition  weather patterns impacting consumers  including unseasonably cool or rainy weather  can result in fewer sales to consumers and ultimately lower sales to trade partners and higher return credits issued if we haven t been able to forecast and adjust for the change in consumer buying patterns 
while the direct store delivery system offers many benefits to us  it is also an expensive and fairly fixed cost distribution system 
we have invested significantly in our production facilities and management team  the benefit of this investment will result from higher volume of product through the facilities 
conversely  lower volume than expected will result in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 
finally  we may choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition in some markets  which usually has a negative short term effect on our results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net sales  certain statements of operations data for fiscal years  and these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

income tax benefit expense net income loss net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal after removing the impact of the additional week in fiscal and the impact of the fresh samantha acquisition since may   our sales increased from the prior year 
our sales increase  excluding the sales resulting from the fresh samantha acquisition  occurred in all geographic regions and resulted primarily from growth in existing markets and accounts and new products 
we did not enter any significant new markets in fiscal other than through the fresh samantha acquisition 
our food bar business continues as an important product  although it continues to represent less than of our net sales in both fiscal and fiscal the sales increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  which occurred in all geographic regions  resulted primarily from a growth in existing markets and accounts and new products and b sales volume from new markets 
net sales in fiscal were also impacted by our expanded use of third party distributors 
our sales growth rate this year  excluding the fresh samantha acquisition  was about the same for both our direct store delivery and our distributor business 
total sales in our newest markets  which include the midwest  mid atlantic and atlanta markets  continued at less than of beverage and bar sales  excluding fresh samantha brand sales  and represent a significant percentage increase from last year when we were in an earlier selling stage in some of those markets 
because we sell product to distributors at a wholesale price lower than the price to retail trade partners  our increased use of distributors will not produce the same net sales growth that would occur if the same number of products were sold to retail trade partners 
with a few exceptions  the fresh samantha brand has not historically been sold through distributors 
we expect to supplement the eastern seaboard direct store delivery system with distributors during the next year  which may impact net sales growth percentages 
since september   we have used branded  custom designed milliliter and milliliter bottles made from recyclable  hdpe plastic for the odwalla brand 
our new bottle retains fresh fruit flavor notes better than the bottles commonly used by our competitors 
it also has a tamper resistant  screw on cap  which allows consumers to easily reseal their beverage while drinking odwalla on the go 
the characteristics of the new bottle also extend the shelf life of our products 
at the same time  we began using a new bottling line designed to accommodate our new bottles 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced problems in producing beverage products to meet sales orders during the initial introduction period 
we also experienced unexpected issues that caused some products to ferment and  ultimately  caused some bottles to bloat 
these issues disrupted a consistent flow of product during the first half of the first quarter of fiscal we believe that these issues negatively impacted sales in the first quarter 
we implemented the guidance in eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  which does not represent a change from our existing accounting policies 
accordingly  any cash sales incentives are classified as a reduction of revenue 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal cost of sales was million or of net sales in fiscal gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal after decreasing from in fiscal in late december  the san joaquin valley in central california experienced a citrus freeze that seriously damaged the navel orange crop 
other parts of california were also affected  but to a significantly lesser extent 
the freeze also impacted the california valencia orange crop and other citrus  which extended the impact throughout calendar year and into early calendar the immediate effect of the freeze during this period was to increase the price of the fresh citrus we purchased 
we also experienced poorer citrus yields and some delay in fruit maturity 
the freeze also caused us to be more reliant on citrus sources farther from our production facility than in prior years  which caused an increase in freight cost 
with the fresh samantha acquisition  we now have two production facilities 
the impact on cost of sales of the fresh samantha facility in saco  maine had a slight negative impact for the year 
this results primarily due to the reliance on more expensive florida fruit in the summer months 
gross margin increased primarily due to a a return  in the second half of fiscal  to more favorable pricing and yield for ingredients  primarily citrus  for the odwalla brand  b better efficiencies in labor and packaging yields due to the new bottling line for the odwalla brand  offset by c additional packaging costs due to the new bottle and the increased costs of the new bottling line and d the co packing costs in the summer months for citrus products for the fresh samantha brand 
the continued use of third party distributors also negatively affected gross margins 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal to compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a unfavorable pricing and yield for ingredients  primarily citrus  and b increases in labor  due to poorer yields  and co packing costs 
sales and distribution 
sales and distribution expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in fiscal sales and distribution expenses increased as a percentage of net sales and in dollars in fiscal when compared to the and million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars is due to the fresh samantha acquisition in may  increased costs of utilizing a direct store delivery system in some of our newer markets  some of which were previously serviced with third party distributors  and increased national and regional labor costs 
future decisions regarding growth and expansion consistent with long term strategic objectives may increase sales and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales 
we continue to look for efficiencies in this part of our business 
however  expansion into markets serviced by our direct store delivery system will require an investment for some initial period and changes to the eastern seaboard direct store delivery system may cause a short term increase in costs as we standardize our national operations 
expenses will also continue to be affected as we seek to find the proper mix in a given market between our own direct store delivery system and third party distributors 
the perishable nature of most of our products and our stringent service standards can make it difficult to find appropriate distributors in some markets 
the fiscal expense increase as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal  resulted from increased sales volume supported by a more fixed cost operations structure  which was offset by a full year of costs in our newest expansion markets  particularly the washington  dc area 
marketing 
marketing expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the fiscal expense represented an increase from million or of net sales in fiscal most of the decrease in expenses from last year results from a change in marketing strategy which resulted in fewer employees  less advertising  and decreased product tastings as we move to more strategic tastings  both in retail locations and at community events 
these reductions were offset by an increase in market research during a portion of fiscal despite reduced marketing expense this year compared to the prior year  we expect marketing expenses to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as we integrate the odwalla and fresh samantha brands and implement changes in our marketing strategy 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of increased product tastings  both in retail locations and sponsorships of community events  consultants and product research and development 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily due to professional fees and a general increase in expenses resulting from the fresh samantha acquisition 
we expect that general and administrative costs will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we continue to integrate fresh samantha with odwalla and invest in infrastructure  particularly in information systems and research and development  to allow for sustainable growth 
in fiscal  the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal resulted primarily from increased payroll in human resources  financial analysis and information technology personnel  increased recruiting and search firm costs  and consulting fees 
amortization of intangible assets from fresh samantha acquisition 
the cost of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired with the fresh samantha acquisition are being amortized over their estimated useful lives as more fully described in notes to the financial statements beginning on page due to the significance of this expense  we have included it as a separate line item 
proceeds from insurance settlement 
on april   we entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement with new hampshire insurance company regarding the business interruption insurance claim we filed following the recall in october under the mutual release and settlement agreement  new hampshire insurance company agreed to pay us million 
in connection with the settlement  we dismissed our lawsuit against the insurance company filed on may  in the united states district court for the eastern district of california in fresno  california 
the proceeds from the insurance settlement were recorded net of legal fees of million in the third quarter of fiscal series a preferred stock inducement expense 
in connection with the fresh samantha acquisition and the february  preferred stock conversion agreement between odwalla and catterton simon partners  we issued  shares of odwalla s common stock to catterton simon partners in exchange for  shares of odwalla s series a preferred stock  representing all of the outstanding shares of such stock  held by catterton simon partners and cancellation of a warrant to purchase  shares of odwalla s common stock held by catterton simon partners 
the issuance of common stock to catterton simon partners was approved by odwalla s shareholders on april  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an expense of million to reflect the value of the  additional shares issued to induce catterton simon to convert the series a stock that they held and to cancel the outstanding warrant that they held 
the inducement shares were valued using the market price for our common stock at the date the shareholders approved the issuance 
recall and related costs 
on october   odwalla was notified by the state of washington environmental health services of an epidemiological link between several cases of e 
coli o h and odwalla s apple juice products 
we immediately implemented a recall of all odwalla products containing apple juice 
odwalla incurred significant direct costs as a result of the recall 
under our arrangement with our insurance company  we pay a portion of the legal fees related to third party claims resulting from the recall and related claims 
we originally established a million charge to establish a liability for future professional fees related to the recall 
the reserve for professional fees is an estimate  and there can be no assurance that the actual reserved liability established will be adequate 
we reviewed this charge during fiscal and believed that the reserve established was adequate 
in fiscal  we reviewed available information  including recently filed claims  and added  to this reserve 
we reviewed this charge in fiscal and believe that the remaining balance of the reserve established is reasonable 
we will continue to assess this liability and will make appropriate adjustments if circumstances change 
approximately  of this reserve for professional fees remained at september  in early  odwalla was informed that it was the subject of a federal grand jury investigation eastern district of california concerning the recall and related issues 
in july  in connection with the investigation  we entered into a misdemeanor plea agreement with the us government  concerning shipments in october of unpasteurized apple juice from a single contaminated batch 
as part of the plea agreement  odwalla agreed to pay  over a period of five years  million to the us government and  to three non profit organizations involved with advancing the cause of food safety 
we also agreed  as part of the conditions attached to a five year term of unsupervised court probation  to develop and implement a haccp plan and to undertake other measures related to food safety 
the net present value of the payments of million was recorded as a recall and related cost in fiscal interest and other expense income 
odwalla had net interest expense in fiscal of  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal gross interest income of   and  in fiscal  and resulted primarily from the remainder of the proceeds of the may public offering  the proceeds in of the january series a preferred stock offering  and the net proceeds of the private placement in may in connection with the fresh samantha acquisition 
gross interest expense of   and  in fiscal  and resulted primarily from interest on the line of credit  capital lease interest and other debt  including capital leases and debt acquired with the fresh samantha acquisition 
income tax benefit 
the million tax expense in fiscal results from taxes currently due of approximately  due primarily to minimum tax and alternative minimum taxes plus deferred taxes of approximately million on temporary differences between book and tax income reduced by a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate of for the year considers the effective tax rate of applied prior to the fresh samantha acquisition which was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due the valuation allowance established 
the fresh samantha acquisition was structured as a tax free reorganization for income tax purposes 
this results in intangible and other assets with a basis for accounting purposes  as the acquisition was accounted for using purchase accounting  that does not exist for tax reporting purposes 
because the financial accounting basis will result in future accounting amortization in excess of tax amortization  a deferred tax liability was established to account for that difference 
at the same time  most of our deferred tax valuation allowance was removed and included in the determination of the cost of goodwill in accordance with sfas we expect that our effective tax rate will be beginning in fiscal the  and  income tax benefit for fiscal and results from the tax benefit associated with operating losses 
the effective tax rate in and after offsetting the impact of the non deductible settlement with the us government discussed previously for varies from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of establishing a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of such assets 
as noted above  most of the valuation allowance was released in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at september   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at august  the increase resulted primarily from operating activities 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
this consisted of the net income plus depreciation  amortization  preferred stock inducement expense  deferred taxes and other non current liabilities  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
increases in accounts receivable are generally due to increased sales volume compared to the same time period in fiscal  particularly due to the fresh samantha sales included since the may  acquisition 
the inventory increase represents primarily from frozen raw materials acquired or stored in the second half of fiscal and the additional inventory resulting from the fresh samantha acquisition and increased sales volume 
prepaid expenses increased primarily due to the timing of insurance payments  advances for future costs and refundable deposits and similar items 
accounts payable decreased when considering the payment of liabilities acquired with the fresh samantha transaction 
accrued expenses  which include the reserve for recall related professional fees  decreased primarily as we paid for previously accrued costs 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million 
the decrease consisted primarily of the sale of short term investments offset by capital expenditures for data processing and computer hardware and software  production equipment at the dinuba plant  display coolers and by cash costs of the fresh samantha acquisition  representing primarily professional fees 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted principally of proceeds from the sale of common stock in a private placement at the time of the fresh samantha acquisition offset by payments of debt acquired from fresh samantha and payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
we had purchase commitments for the future delivery of raw materials as of september   approximately million of which are under contracts and are expected to be completed by january we ve used  and expect to continue to use  both operating and capital lease financing to obtain refrigeration coolers used in selling our products  computer and communication equipment  and production assets  primarily equipment 
if we don t obtain adequate lease or other financing  our inability to obtain needed equipment may negatively impact our operations 
at september   we owed million for capital lease obligations  primarily related to leasing of production equipment  computer equipment and vehicles 
in september  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a new lender and paid the balance then outstanding under  and terminated  our prior security agreement 
the credit agreement  which was further amended in april in connection with the fresh samantha acquisition  provides borrowing under a revolving credit facility up to million 
we are also required to meet certain covenants  including maintenance of certain financial  leverage  and debt service coverage ratios  and certain tangible net worth 
the first million of borrowings do not require separate borrowing base reporting 
borrowings over million and up to million are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit agreement defines eligible accounts receivable which generally represents all trade accounts receivable less delinquent balances 
the credit agreement also contains certain business restrictions  including the ability to borrow additional funds  limitations on capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts  restrictions on the payment of cash dividends  sale or purchase of company stock  ability to encumber or sell company assets  and limitations on other business transactions without prior approval from the lender 
interest is payable monthly at either the prime interest rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus 
the interest rate to be incurred is selected by odwalla at the inception of each loan and may be changed during the period in which the borrowed amount is outstanding in accordance with provisions included in the credit agreement 
the interest rate paid as of september  was 
the credit agreement has a three year term 
as of september   we were not in compliance with one covenant as we had exceeded the capital asset acquisition limitation included in the credit agreement 
we requested our lender to waive the specific september  covenant violation and  in november  the lender granted the requested waiver 
the increased costs associated with integrating fresh samantha  our plans to invest in new products and certain new market areas  and general corporate needs may cause us to seek additional financing that may be dilutive to current investors or result in a higher debt to equity ratio than would otherwise be the case 
any financing we obtain may not be on terms favorable to us  even if it is available 
based upon information currently available  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our current and anticipated borrowing capability will be adequate to meet our obligations as they become due in the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
due to this  we did not have significant overall currency exposure at september  foreign currency rate risk 
as almost all of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and we do not expect to incur significant gains and losses 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
