item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current fiscal year developments during the fiscal year ended november   quintel communications  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively  the company began the process of redefining the company as an on line direct marketing provider within the internet industry  while simultaneously striving to increase shareholder value 
this process included the culmination of the following events the cessation in june of the company s legacy pay per call business 
the june redemption of million shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the commencement in august of the formation of the quintel network  a portfolio of strategic investments and marketing partnerships with internet marketing companies  e commerce retailers and service providers 
the launching of two internet websites  grouplotto 
com and multibuyer 
com  in november and december  respectively 
prior to the commencement of the company s strategic marketing redefinition of this internet initiative  all of the company s products and services were sold with the use of conventional marketing channels  specifically television broadcast media  telemarketing  direct mail and print advertising 
the company s internet initiative  and its underlying business plan and strategy  have caused the company to terminate the marketing of its legacy products and services  which had previously been conducted within its lec billed products and services segment  and its customer acquisition services segment 
this company wide redefinition should be considered when using the company s historical results in evaluating the possibilities of future operations  cash flows and financial position 
general during the fiscal year ended november   the company was engaged in providing and marketing various telecommunications products and services  and utilizing its extensive database to facilitate direct marketing services for residential long distance customer acquisition programs 
the company s revenues from the foregoing were generated through fees paid for customer acquisitions and ongoing commissions earned under revenue sharing arrangements with long distance carriers 
the company is no longer actively marketing these products or services 
nevertheless  the company continues to collect commissions pursuant to its revenue sharing agreements 
additionally  the company continued to service and bill its residual voice mail service customer base in the year ended november  the active marketing of the voice mail service was terminated in november the company s present focus  and entire resource base  is involved with developing  operating  and entering into strategic investments with internet based direct marketing companies 
the company continues to recognize revenues through the offering of consumer products and services  but in the latter part of the fiscal year ended november   the company began the process of shifting the marketing aspect of these operations to the internet 
as part of this process  the company created the quintel network  a portfolio of strategic marketing investments and marketing partnerships with internet marketing companies  e commerce retailers and service providers 
together  the companies that comprise the quintel network market a wide variety of products and services aimed at the consumer audience 
see quintel network 
the company s lec billed products and services segment  which historically included revenues from voice mail services and telephone entertainment services principally comprised of psychic related pay per call and club products and services  are billed and collected through the use of service bureaus  which act as conduits for the local and long distance exchange carriers 
the company s customer acquisition services segment  which has historically included revenues from residential long distance customer acquisi tions and related usage royalties  as well as prepaid and conventional cellular phone customer acquisition services  were billed to and collected directly from the parties to the agreements  and did not require service bureau intervention 
historically  the services offered by the company have evolved based on changing consumer tastes  as well as the impact of telephone company billing practices  governmental regulation  and most recently  the internet 
revenue from the company s lec billed products and services segment s voice mail and club product components have historically been recognized  net of an estimated provision for customer chargebacks which include refunds and credits  as customers automatically renewed their monthly subscriptions 
in regard to the company s lec billed products and services segment s telephone entertainment services component  which consisted principally of the pay per call activities  up to and including may  see prior year special charges  the company recognized revenues from the telephone entertainment services at the time the customer initiated a billable transaction  net of an estimated provision for customer chargebacks 
in the case of its legacy revenues earned within its lec billed product and service segment  the company historically estimated the reserve for customer chargebacks monthly  based on updated chargeback history  with any resulting adjustments being charged against current revenue 
the company estimated chargebacks and other provisions for new products and services without a previous operating history  based on currently available experience with similar products and services  and adjusted such estimates as further information became available 
since reserves were established prior to the periods in which chargebacks were actually expended  the company s revenues may be adjusted in later periods in the event that the company s incurred chargebacks vary from the estimated amounts 
revenues from the company s customer acquisition services segment were recorded upon the achievement of certain events particular to the corresponding program s fulfillment liability 
subsequent to the delivery of the initial sales record to the respective long distance carrier  the company may have been required to provide to the customer certain products and services fulfillment liability  such as prepaid cellular telephones and or complimentary airline ticket redemption vouchers 
these costs were estimated and accrued  as a component of marketing expense  at the time the associated revenues were recorded 
this estimation is adjusted to actual amounts in subsequent periods 
there were no chargebacks from the company s long distance customer acquisition programs 
the conventional cellular and prepaid cellular phone customer acquisition programs were impacted by chargebacks in the years in which they were in operation  principally in the fiscal year ended november  revenues from the company s e commerce segment for the year ended november  were immaterial  although such revenues are expected to comprise the majority of future fiscal period revenues 
such subsequent period e commerce revenues will be recognized upon the completion of the performance of all of the company s obligations to a customer or vendor relative to the particular activity  including delivery of products or services  delivery of advertising impressions  recording of all product costs  discounts and fulfillment obligations  and the recording of all other variable direct costs associated with completing the company s obligation to the customer or vendor 
such revenue recognition will be subject to traditional provisions for returns and collection losses 
the company offered various other products and services  principally telephone security equipment  list rental and financial information services  in the fiscal years ended november   and these revenues are included in the company s corporate and other segment reporting category  and in the three years ended november   comprised an immaterial portion of the company s total net revenues 
transaction with major customer and termination of economic dependence revenues from the company s customer acquisition service segment were earned entirely from the residential distributor program agreement with qwest 
such revenues accounted for approximately million  of the company s total revenue 
in november  qwest informed the company that the customers being acquired for it by the company were not remaining qwest customers long enough to justify the acquisition costs qwest was required to pay the company  and  accordingly  the company should no longer solicit customers on qwest s behalf 
therefore  the company will not realize any revenues from customer acquisitions in future fiscal years  but will continue to be entitled to participate in qwest s net revenues earned from an acquired customer s future long distance usage

year ended november  compared to year ended november  the company s net revenues for its segmental operations for the year ended november  and are presented below net revenues by segment net revenue change inc dec change inc dec year ended november  lec billed products and services    customer acquisition services    e commerce   corporate and other    total    net revenue for the year ended november  decreased  or  when compared to the year ended november  the significant portion of the decrease in net revenues occurred in the company s lec billed products and services segment 
the individual components of such decrease are described below 
the decrease was partially attributable to reductions in the company s enhanced service revenues of approximately million  or  when compared with the prior year 
this decline in enhanced service net revenue was the direct result of the company discontinuing the active marketing of such services in response to the november billing service agreement termination by billing information concepts  inc bic  the company s primary enhanced service billing agent at that time 
the company continued to bill and provide enhanced services to the member base that was in place at the time of the billing cessation approximately  subscribers 
during the year ended november   the company recognized an approximate reduction in such residual member base 
as a result of the termination of enhanced service marketing and the above referenced attrition rate  management believes that the enhanced service portion of the company s net revenues will continue to decline  and be an immaterial component thereof  in the fiscal year ending november  see service bureau and local exchange carriers 
the decrease in the lec billed product and service segment net revenue was due also  in part  to reductions in the company s club product net revenues of approximately million  or  when compared with the year ended november  the significant cause of such reduction in club net revenues relates to i an agreement entered into between the company and access resources services  inc ars  which eliminated the company s active participation in the pay per call business the ars agreement  and ii the company s intentional migration away from the entertainment service business which was the exclusive avenue for club product marketing and member procurement 
this reduction was partially offset by royalty income of approximately million  earned in consideration for the termination of the company s active role in the pay per call business 
the royalty agreement became effective june   and therefore  there was no comparative prior year royalty revenue 
the lec billed product and service segment s single largest decrease related to the company s entertainment services  specifically the pay per call portion 
this decrease in net revenues amounted to approximately million  or  when compared with the prior year  and is directly related to both the cessation of the company s active participation in the pay per call business as a result of the consummation of the ars agreement  as well as the june repositioning of such revenue as an offsetting component of the cost of sales of the company s customer acquisition services segment 
see prior year special charge 
other reductions in the company s net revenues were attributable to the customer acquisition services segment  where decreases in conventional cellular phone customer acquisitions approximated million  or  when compared to the prior year  and a decrease in prepaid cellular phone customer acquisitions of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in conventional cellular acquisitions was the result of the company s sale  on november   of its interest in the consolidated majority owned entity that provided such services 
the decrease in prepaid cellular phone customer acquisitions was the result of the company s dissolution of its prepaid cellular phone customer acquisition subsidiary  effective december  the company s net revenue decreases were partially mitigated by the customer acquisition service segment  specifically from the long distance customer acquisition component ldca of such segment 
ldca revenues and related usage increased by approximately million from the prior year s comparable period  or 
the customer acquisition commission component decreased from approximately million in the year ended november  to approximately million in the year ended november   for a decrease of approximately million  or 
due to the cessation of the company s primary long distance customer acquisition program with qwest  effective july   and the complete cessation of all other qwest marketing efforts in november see termination of residential long distance customer acquisition marketing  management anticipates that the long distance acquisition commission revenues will be non existent in subsequent fiscal periods 
the company s net revenues earned pursuant to usage sharing agreements with qwest  whereby the company earned a percentage of an acquired customer s long distance telephone usage  increased to approximately million in the year ended november   from approximately  for the year ended november   representing an increase of approximately million 
the percentage of usage sharing revenues to which the company will be entitled to in future fiscal periods has been substantially reduced pursuant to the november  cessation of the company s marketing efforts directed at acquiring new long distance customers for qwest 
the usage sharing agreement revenues are a product of the telephone usage of previously acquired customers 
pursuant to the company s terminated marketing efforts  management believes that the company s net revenues under existing usage sharing agreements will decline in future fiscal periods  and become a less meaningful component of the company s customer acquisition services segment revenues 
the company s reported net revenues are a product of the gross revenues generated within each reporting period less the provision for chargebacks for the related reporting period  which is recorded as a direct reduction from such gross revenues  except for revenues generated from royalties and long distance acquisition commissions  which are not subject to provision for consumer chargebacks

the actual chargebacks incurred for services and programs that are no longer being marketed  are charged against the previously established reserves  with any adjustment being reflected currently 
the company s cost of revenues  which are comprised of i marketing costs directly associated with the procurement and retention of customers  which includes direct response advertising costs  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and ii the related billing  collection and customer service costs  both of which are offset by the net revenue generated from certain premium offerings in conjunction with the marketing of other products and services

the reduction of these costs resulted from the company s cessation of marketing its enhanced services in response to the termination  by bic  of the billing services agreement in november see service bureaus and local exchange carriers 
in addition  the company significantly reduced its marketing efforts directed at the company s residential long distance customer acquisition activities  and effective november   terminated such efforts due to i increased costs incurred in acquiring long distance customers  ii associated fulfillment cost increases and unfavorable redemption rates  and iii significantly increased customer service costs 
these three factors contributed to decreased margins in the company s long distance customer acquisition component of its customer acquisition services segment 
additionally  the decreases in the cost of revenues was attributable to the cessation of the company s active marketing of its pay per call services see prior year special charge  and the commencement of offering such services as a premium to potential and acquired long distance customers  with the net revenues earned therefrom recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing costs

the company commenced such personnel reductions in september and continued the reductions into the third quarter of the fiscal year ended november  additional reductions in sg a are attributable to the terms of the agreement  pursuant to which the company i eliminated its media buying operation  which included a staff of approximately twenty one employees  ii was released from continuing rent expense obligations under an assignment of a lease for the office space occupied by such media department  and iii disposed of all the media operation s property and equipment

such escrowed reserves been have reduced to immaterial levels in fiscal  pursuant to the company s termination of its offering of entertainment services resulting from the terms of the agreement  and will not contribute significant amounts of interest income in subsequent fiscal periods 
the company s effective income tax rate is a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates and state taxes 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  net revenue for the year ended november  was  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended november  the decrease was attributable to decreases in net revenues from the company s entertainment services of  or  and decreases in net revenues of  or  resulting from the termination of the at t strategic corporate relationship 
such net revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in net revenues from the company s residential long distance customer acquisition services under the qwest agreement of  see residential long distance customer acquisition services 
additionally  decreases were offset by increases in net revenues from the company s club products of  or  and increases in net revenues from the company s enhanced services of  or 
further offsetting increases were realized from the company s net revenues from cellular phone related activities  both on a conventional and prepaid basis  of  or 
these activities commenced  at significant levels  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such activities were discontinued during the fiscal year ended november  for the year ended november   entertainment services  enhanced services  residential long distance customer acquisition services as provided to qwest  club product memberships  the at t strategic corporate partnership and cellular phone activities and other products approximated     and of net revenues  respectively

the provisions for chargebacks  recorded as a direct reduction to revenues  for the year ended november  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended november  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in chargebacks from the company s entertainment services of  or  when compared to the prior year 
this decrease in chargebacks resulted from the company s efforts to reduce marketing the company s entertainment services 
additionally  during the year ended november   the company s club product chargebacks decreased by  or  when compared to the prior comparable year 
this decrease was the result of improved chargeback rate experiences realized on the club product during the year ended november  the company s enhanced services actual chargeback rate experience increased during the year ended november  of related gross sales when compared to the year ended november  of related gross sales 
this increase in enhanced service chargebacks was attributable to significant increases in customer service refunds and credits chargebacks being issued by the local exchange carriers  primarily in the nine month period from march  to november   as compared to the prior year s comparable period 
the company believes that the increase in such refunds and credits resulted from changes in local exchange carriers customer refund policies 
the local exchange carriers made such changes in response to concerns expressed by governmental regulatory authorities regarding the necessity to make it easier for customers to have charges which they claim were unauthorized removed from their telephone bills 
the company believes that the customer service policy changes implemented by the local exchange carriers also contributed to the increased chargebacks recognized on the company s entertainment services during the fiscal year ended november  the impact of certain items on the operations of the company  namely  cost of revenues  chargebacks and marketing expenses  can be better understood in relation to gross revenues  as opposed to net revenues 
accordingly  such information is provided in the paragraphs that follow 
during the year ended november   gross revenues from entertainment services were  with corresponding chargeback allowances of  resulting in an approximate chargeback rate of 
during the year ended november   gross revenues from the entertainment services were  with corresponding chargeback allowances of  resulting in an approximate chargeback rate of

the company s other products and services contributed an immaterial amount to chargebacks during the years ended november   and the company s residential long distance customer acquisition service revenues and the at t strategic corporate partnership revenues are not encumbered by chargebacks 
cost of revenues for the year ended november  was  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended november  the decrease is directly attributable to reductions in service bureau fees related to the decrease in revenues generated from the company s entertainment services and decreases in advertising costs expended in procuring such revenues 
the service bureau fees  including the cost of psychic operators related to the entertainment services  were approximately  and  for the years ended november  and  respectively  accounting for approximately  or  of the total decrease in cost of revenues 
in addition  the entertainment services advertising costs  principally from television broadcast media and related commercial production costs  were approximately  and  for the years ended november  and  respectively  accounting for approximately  or  of the total decrease in the cost of revenues 
 of the decrease in cost of revenues was attributable to the company s implementation  during the quarter ended august   of its strategy to reposition the marketing emphasis of the entertainment services  in response to decreasing margins  increasing marketing costs and increasing chargebacks 
the cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended november  did not have a comparable reduction 
during the fiscal year ended november   the entertainment services were used in conjunction with the marketing of the company s other products and services as opposed to an independent revenue source 
in accordance with this repositioning  any amounts received by the company in providing entertainment services  net of estimated chargebacks  were accounted for as a reduction to the cost of revenues for the company s other products and services 
the effect recognized under such repositioning during the year ended november  amounted to gross entertainment service revenues of approximately  net of corresponding chargebacks of  being offset to cost of revenues for the reduction of approximately  referenced above 
the foregoing decreases to cost of revenues were offset by increases in service bureau fees and marketing costs related to increased gross revenues recognized from the company s enhanced services  club product and residential long distance and conventional cellular phone customer acquisition services 
additionally  the decrease in cost of revenues was further offset by cost increases incurred in the company s test marketing of its prepaid cellular phone business  which approximated  during the year ended november  the company discontinued the marketing for new prepaid cellular phone customers during the third quarter of the year ended november  and subsequently disposed of such portion of its operations and liquidated the related inventories 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased to approximately for the year ended november   from approximately for the year ended november  this gross margin deterioration was specifically attributable to the company s decreasing margins recognized on the company s entertainment services 
in response to the increased costs per unit of sale generated for its entertainment services  coupled with the significant chargeback rate increases  as previously discussed  the company has discontinued marketing the entertainment services as an independent revenue source 
commencing in the quarter ended august   the entertainment services were repositioned and offered solely i for purposes of acquiring marketing information for future marketing campaigns and ii as a premium offering  given in conjunction with the company s other products and services 
gross revenues for the year ended november  were approximately  with total marketing costs of approximately  or of such gross revenues 
gross revenues for the year ended november  were approximately  with marketing costs of approximately  or of such gross revenues 
such increase in marketing costs  when measured as a percentage of gross revenues  was  or an increase of in comparative percentage terms 
this increase was primarily due to the decreasing returns realized on the marketing expenditures of the company in generating entertainment services gross revenues prior to its discontinuance as an independent revenue source and to the customer acquisition costs incurred by the company in the conduct of its residential long distance customer acquisition programs 
the remaining significant component of the cost of revenue is service bureau fees 
for the years ended november  and  such service bureau fees were approximately  and  respectively 
this decrease of approximately  or  was primarily attributable to the company s decrease in entertainment services revenues and its corresponding reduction in service bureau usage 
this decrease was partially offset by increased service bureau fees relating to the company s increase in gross revenue activity from enhanced services  club product memberships and residential long distance customer acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended november  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended november  the reduction is primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization expense of approximately  pursuant to an impairment write off of intangibles  primarily goodwill  during the quarter ended may  the portion of intangibles expensed by such impairment charge in the fiscal year ended november  was separately classified under the financial statement account heading special charges  with the amount of such write off approximating  the decrease further resulted from net reductions in officers compensation of approximately  and decreases in customer service costs of approximately  increases in professional fees  personnel costs  and occupancy costs  offset the aforementioned decreases

the company s benefit provision for income taxes is the result of the combination of federal statutory rates and required state statutory rates applied to pre tax income loss 
this combined effective rate was and for the years ended november  and  respectively 
income tax benefit for the year ended november  totaled  as compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended november  the company s effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate due to the addition of state income taxes and certain expenses  principally goodwill amortization  that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
in the year ended november   the company recorded an intangible impairment charge of approximately million 
as of november   the company had a net operating loss carryback of approximately  also at november   the company had approximately  of future tax deductible amounts  principally arising from the future deductibility of net chargeback reserves and the goodwill impairment charge 
due to the uncertain realization  through carryforward  regarding the state deferred tax assets  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against such state deferred tax assets at november  the remaining federal deferred tax assets were further reduced for a valuation allowance 
the federal valuation allowance reduces the federal deferred tax assets to their realizable carryback value at november  liquidity and capital resources at november   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  reflecting an increase of approximately million when compared to the million in cash and cash equivalents held at november during the year ended november   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the significant components resulting in this increase  when compared with the approximate million of cash used in operations for the year ended november   were i collections on trade accounts receivable of approximately million  ii income tax refunds attributable to net operating loss carrybacks of approximately million  iii reductions to prepaid expenses of approximately million and iv net income of approximately million for the year ended november  items that offset the increase in cash provided by operations during the year ended november   were i payments on trade payables of approximately million and ii payments on accrued expenses of approximately million 
the approximately million in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended november  primarily resulted from marketable security purchases 
the company s marketable securities increased approximately million during the year ended november   to approximately million  compared to million in marketable securities held at november  additional funds used in investing activites during the year ended november   were for strategic marketing investments in privately held companies of approximately million 
such investments were made by the company s e commerce segment to establish and further enhance its competitive marketing position in the internet marketplace 
the e commerce segment also acquired approximately  in capitalizable internal software during the year ended november  as an offset to cash used in investing activities during the year ended november   the company received  in proceeds on the sale of its media department s property and equipment in accordance with the agreement 
cash used in financing investing activities during the year ended november  amounted to  of which i  was used for the repurchase of the company s common stock  currently held in treasury  and ii  was used for the redemption and subsequent retirement of  shares of common stock at per share 
historically  the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund the cost of advertising and promotion 
additional funds have been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines and further development of businesses currently being test marketed 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company began the process or redefining itself as an on line direct marketing provider of consumer products and services  within the internet industry 
the company s future plans and business strategy call for its internet based e commerce segment to be its sole operating focus  and the significant source of all future revenues 
this internet initiative may have a significant impact on the company s capital and liquidity resources relating to the e commerce segment s possible expenditures for i marketing and advertising campaigns  ii the cost of additional personnel required to occupy executive  operational and administrative positions  iii product development costs  iv technology based costs  and v other miscellaneous costs 
our internet initiative  and its underlying business plan and strategy  has caused the company to terminate the marketing of its legacy products and services 
accordingly  these services will no longer contribute to the company s cash flows in subsequent fiscal periods 
this company wide redefinition should be considered when using the company s historical results in evaluating future operations  cash flows and financial position 
under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions including the substantial costs potentially attributable to the company s internet initiative  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company does not have any long term obligations and does not intend to incur any long term obligations in the near future 
as the company seeks to extend its reach into the e commerce arena  as well as identify new and other consumer and non consumer product and services  the company may use existing cash reserves  long term financing or other means to finance such diversification
