results of operations net revenues the company s net revenues are derived from software licenses and fees for services  which include engineering services  consulting  custom engineering  support and training 
net revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal in fiscal  net revenues increased by from million in fiscal the fiscal decline in revenue performance was worldwide across most geographies and is attributable to delays in large project deals as well as customer delays due to year issues as well as other market factors 
the recovery of the customer channel from the impact of year has been slower than expected 
the fiscal to revenue increase was due to stronger revenue performance across all geographies attributable to several factors including the ease of electronic licensing  increased customer contacts as a result of added sales resources and yk upgrade sales 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  no single customer accounted for greater than of the company s net revenues 
international revenues continue to be a significant portion of net revenues  comprising of the revenues for fiscal and and for and  respectively 
license revenues 
license revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal over and an increase of in fiscal over license revenues were approximately of total net revenues for fiscal and and of total net revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal decline in license revenues resulted from customer delays due to year issues and a slower than expected recovery of the customer channel from the impact of yk 
the fiscal to license revenue increase was due to several factors including the ease of electronic licensing  increased customer contacts due to larger sales resources and yk upgrade sales 
the fiscal increase was across all geographies 
service revenues 
revenue from services remained relatively constant in fiscal at million  a increase over the million level of fiscal and the million in service revenues in fiscal cost of revenues the company s overall cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues can be affected by mix changes in net revenue contribution between product families  geographic regions and channels of distribution  since both price and cost characteristics associated with these revenue streams can vary greatly 
the company can also experience fluctuations in gross margin as net revenues increase or decrease since certain costs of revenues including technology  service  product assembly and distribution act as fixed costs within certain volume ranges 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues includes royalties paid to certain software vendors  amortization of acquired technologies  product packaging  documentation and all costs associated with the acquisition of components  assembling of finished products  warehousing and shipping 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which in turn was a decrease from in fiscal the increase from to was due to the impact of fixed costs over lower unit sale volume 
these fixed costs include technology and overhead costs 
this impact is partially offset by declining material costs resulting from the continuing growth of e commerce business 
the decline from to resulted from the effects of royalty dispute settlement negotiated with a technology provider during fiscal and reduced technology costs together with the impact of stable fixed costs over higher unit sales volume 
in addition  material costs declined as a result of increasing e commerce trade  or business conducted over the internet 
during the year ended september   the company reached a settlement of a royalty dispute with one of its technology providers which resulted in an element of past royalties being forgiven and an additional retroactive refund being received 
in total  approximately million was credited to royalty expense during the year ended september  in addition  the company received a reduction in both the ongoing royalty rate and in the number of the company s products  which are subject to payment of royalties 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes documentation  consulting and personnel related expenses associated with providing such services 
costs of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which in turn was an increase from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal resulted from relatively constant costs as a percentage of higher fiscal revenues 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was a result of increased staffing levels in the professional services area 
the higher staffing levels were part of an effort by the company to increase the visibility of the professional services group to customers 
research and development the company invests in research and development both for new products and to provide continuing enhancements to current products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was a decrease of from fiscal spending of million 
research and development expenses represented of net revenues for fiscal  of net revenues for fiscal and of net revenues for fiscal the spending decrease in fiscal is primarily the result of lower labor costs driven by lower headcount as a result of a planned reduction in force 
the decrease in research and development expenses during fiscal can be attributed to lower depreciation and hardware expenses 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is due to a decline in sales program costs that vary directly with revenue  including commissions and cooperative advertising 
the fiscal increase was due principally to an increase in the size of our direct sales force and commissions as well as sales program costs that vary directly with increased sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses represented of total net revenues for fiscal  of total net revenues for fiscal and of total net revenues for fiscal the transfer of certain staff from other functions due to the creation of the company s divisions drove the increase in fiscal the fiscal increase was due to increased corporate bonuses as a result of exceeding company performance goals 
restructuring charges non recurring charges of million were incurred in fiscal year that related to worldwide restructurings undertaken in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  representing of total net revenues for the fiscal year 
the restructurings included a reduction in personnel of employees  write off of certain acquired technologies  write off of certain fixed assets  and elimination of non essential facilities 
of the million  million related to cash expenditures and million related to non cash charges 
the restructuring charge related to cash expenditures included million for severance costs and million for facilities costs 
the non cash charges related to disposals of fixed assets and write offs of technology 
the disposal of fixed assets is comprised of computer equipment that will no longer be in use due to the reduction of personnel 
the technology write offs relates to technology that will not be used in future product development due to the reduction in development personnel 
this technology was associated with development of the unixware product and had been previously capitalized as it had alternative future use 
in conjunction with the restructuring  the personnel associated with the development of this technology were terminated and this technology no longer had an alternative future use 
the company has restructured its business operations into three independent divisions  each with a separate management team and dedicated development  marketing and sales organizations the server division  the tarantella division and the professional services division 
the company believes this reorganization creates independent focused teams that can pursue revenue in their respective markets and was effective april  as a result of the restructuring plans various regional offices in the united states  united kingdom  latin america and the asia pacific region will be eliminated 
the united states regional facilities and the watford  united kingdom leases have been or will be vacated and restored  and subsequently sub let or terminated by the second quarter of the remaining international offices are expected to be vacated immediately 
of the facilities closed  the majority relates to the server division while a minor portion relates to the corporate division which is comprised primarily of the finance and general and administrative functions of the company s united kingdom subsidiary 
the company anticipates that all of the payments  except the facility lease payment  will be made by the end of fiscal the majority of the reduction in force was in the server software division 
as of september  a total of positions have been eliminated positions in the server software division  in the corporate division  in the professional services division and in the tarantella division 
together  these cost saving measures are expected to result in a total annual savings of million beginning in the next fiscal year 
other income expense other income and expense consists of interest income net of interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and realized gains and losses on investments  as well as other miscellaneous income and expense items 
net interest income decreased in fiscal to million compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal other income was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain on the sale of an equity security investment of million net of an other than temporary decline in another investment position of million 
the increase in other income in fiscal was due to gains from the partial liquidation of converted debentures of a domestic distribution channel partner of million  net of an other than temporary decline in another investment position of million 
income taxes in fiscal  and  the company s effective income tax rates were  and  respectively 
the fiscal tax reflects the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million and foreign income taxes of million 
the fiscal tax provision primarily reflects foreign income taxes  while the fiscal tax provision reflects losses and expenses without tax benefit for which a valuation allowance has been established 
for an analysis of income taxes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income loss the company reported a net loss of million in fiscal compared to net income of million in fiscal and net losses of million in fiscal the net loss in fiscal is primarily due to lower revenues  restructuring charges and the reduction of net deferred tax assets 
the net income in fiscal was driven by strong revenue performance  which was directly related to the increasing importance of server based computing as well as customers upgrading in preparation for year factors that may affect future results the company s future operating results may be affected by various uncertain trends and factors that are beyond the company s control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions and rapid or unexpected changes in the technologies affecting the company s products 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain and requires accurate anticipation of customer needs and technological trends 
the industry has become increasingly competitive and  accordingly  the company s results may also be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors  including the development of new technologies  the introduction of new products  and the reduction of prices by such competitors to gain or retain market share 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if it were required to lower its prices significantly 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry and future results could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s revenues and operating results may be unpredictable due to the company s shipment patterns 
the company operates with little backlog of orders because its products are generally shipped as orders are received 
in general  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been booked and shipped in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the latter half of that third month 
in addition  the timing of closing of large license contracts and the release of new products and product upgrades increase the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations and the uncertainty of quarterly operating results 
the company s staffing and operating expense levels are based on an operating plan and are relatively fixed throughout the quarter 
as a result  if revenues are not realized in the quarter as expected  the company s expected operating results and cash balances could be adversely affected  and such effect could be substantial and could result in an operating loss and depletion of the company s cash balances 
in such event  it may not be possible for the company to secure sources of cash to maintain operations 
the company experiences seasonality of revenues for both the european and the us federal government markets 
european revenues during the quarter ending june are historically lower or relatively flat compared to the prior quarter 
this reflects a reduction of customer purchases in anticipation of reduced selling activity during the summer months 
sales to the us federal government generally increase during the quarter ending september this seasonal increase is primarily attributable to increased purchasing activity by the us federal government prior to the close of its fiscal year 
additionally  net revenues for the first quarter of the fiscal year are typically lower or relatively flat compared to net revenues of the prior quarter 
the overall cost of revenues may be affected by changes in the mix of net revenue contribution between licenses and services  product families  geographical regions and channels of distribution  as the costs associated with these revenues may have substantially different characteristics 
the company may also experience a change in margin as net revenues increase or decrease since technology costs  service costs and production costs are fixed within certain volume ranges 
the company depends on information received from external sources in evaluating the inventory levels at distribution partners in the determination of reserves for the return of materials not sold  stock rotation and price protection 
significant effort has gone into developing systems and procedures for determining the appropriate reserve level 
as of september  the company established a partial valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets to reduce such asset to the amount that was deemed  more likely than not  to be recoverable prior to expiration 
the company considered  amongst other factors  the historical profitability  prior to one off charges  of the company  projections for future profits and the ability of the company deferred tax assets against these future profits prior to expiration of these assets  the ability of the company s foreign subsidiaries to utilize their deferred tax assets  and the tax effects of one time charges 
as at september  the company reassessed the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets 
this analysis was based on revised earnings projections  the substantial net operating losses incurred during fiscal and the effects of the restructurings undertaken during the year upon the group s tax structure 
as a result of this analysis management determined that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset recorded as of september  would not be recoverable against future earnings prior to expiration 
accordingly the company has established a full valuation allowance against gross deferred tax assets as of september  this resulted in a charge of million to the statement of operations during the year ended september  substantial portions of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
trade sales to international customers represented  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
a substantial portion of the international revenues of the company s united kingdom subsidiary are denominated in the us dollar  and operating results can vary with changes in the us dollar exchange rate to the uk pound sterling 
the company s revenues can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time 
however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s policy is to amortize purchased software and technology licenses using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
due to competitive pressures  it is reasonably possible that those estimates of anticipated future gross revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both will be reduced significantly in the near future 
as a result  the carrying amount of the company s purchased software and technology licenses may be reduced materially in the near future and  therefore  could create an adverse impact on the company s future reported earnings 
on august   the company entered into an agreement with caldera systems  inc caldera in which caldera will acquire the company s server software division and its professional services division 
this transaction involves a number of risks  including but not limited to i the potential disruption of the company s business that might result from employee or customer uncertainty  and lack of focus following announcement of the transaction in connection with integrating the operations of caldera and the company  ii the risk that the announcement of the transaction could result in decisions by customers to defer purchases of products  iii the substantial charges to be incurred due to the transaction  iv the difficulties of managing geographically dispersed operations  and v the possibility that the transactions contemplated in the agreement with caldera might not be consummated 
further  once this transaction is consummated  the ongoing operations of the company will be significantly altered 
the company s revenues will be derived from only two product lines tarantella products  which have only been recently introduced by the company  and openserver products  which are mature products to be distributed on the company s behalf by caldera 
while the company believes that the current level of staffing together with future recruitment plans will be different for the period following the consummation of the transaction  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain current employees or recruit the additional employees necessary to meet the company s ongoing plans 
in addition the company may not generate revenues at the levels forecasted and as a result could find itself in a position of being overstaffed 
as a result the company may need significant restructuring costs to reduce staffing levels 
following the close of the transaction  the company will hold in its treasury a significant investment in caldera  the value of which may be subject to significant fluctuations 
the company continually evaluates potential acquisition candidates 
such candidates are selected based on products or markets that are complementary to those of the company s 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the successful combination of the companies in an efficient and timely manner  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts  the retention of key personnel  the integration of the acquired products  the diversion of management s attention to assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
the company s operations and financial results could be significantly affected by such an acquisition 
the company is exposed to equity price risk regarding the marketable portion of equity securities in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
this risk will increase significantly after the consummation of the transaction with caldera 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the company has also invested in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
the company could lose its entire initial investment in these companies 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure pertaining to these equity securities 
the company s continued success depends to a significant extent on senior management and other key employees 
none of these individuals is subject to a long term employment contract or a non competition agreement 
competition for qualified people in the software industry is intense 
the loss of one or more key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by the company or its competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in the company s results of operations caused by changes in customer demand may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the new european economic and monetary union the emu 
one of the changes resulting from this union required emu member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  on january  on that day  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the next two years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currencies  such as the franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
the company has done a preliminary assessment of the impact the emu formation will have on both its internal systems and the products it sells and has commenced appropriate actions 
the company has not yet determined all of the cost related to addressing this issue  and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at september   a decrease of million from september  the decrease in fiscal is due to operating losses  lower revenues and a decrease in sales linearity  which resulted in lower cash collections 
the company s operating activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was million  compared to cash used for investing activities during fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  and  cash was used to fund purchases of technology  property and equipment  common stock repurchases and short term investments 
the sales of short term investments contributed to the cash provided by investing activities for fiscal cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to cash used for financing activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities included a private placement of the company s stock 
in fiscal and  proceeds from the issuance of common stock were more than offset by the company s stock repurchases and payments on capital lease obligations 
at september   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and short term investments and available bank lines of credit of approximately million against which the company had million in outstanding borrowings 
the company does not believe it will require borrowing capacity greater than the amount available under these lines of credit for at least the next twelve months 
see notes  and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has incurred losses from operations of approximately million in the twelve months ended september  and revenues have declined from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the company recently implemented cost reduction plans in order to reduce operating expenses to levels consistent with current revenues and is investigating financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  if at all  on terms acceptable to the company 
on august   the company entered into an agreement with caldera systems  inc in which caldera systems  inc 
will acquire the company s server software and professional services divisions 
caldera systems  inc will form a new holding company  caldera  inc  to acquire assets from the company s server software division and the company s professional services division  including its employees  products and channel resources 
caldera  inc will have exclusive distribution rights for the sco openserver product line 
sco will receive a ownership interest in caldera  inc  which is estimated to be an aggregate of approximately million shares of caldera stock including approximately million shares reserved for employee options assumed by caldera  inc for options currently held by sco employees joining caldera  inc  and million in cash 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the canopy group  inc  a major stockholder of caldera systems  inc  has agreed to loan million to the company 
the terms of this loan are still to be negotiated but both parties have agreed the terms will be reasonable and customary 
further  caldera systems  inc has agreed to loan million to the company in the form of a short term note repayable at the consummation of the transaction between sco and caldera systems  inc sco will retain its tarantella division and the sco openserver revenue stream and intellectual properties 
the boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition which is subject to the approval of caldera systems  inc and the santa cruz operation  inc 
stockholders  and regulatory agencies  as well as meeting certain other closing conditions 
the companies anticipate closing the transaction during the first calendar quarter of there can be no assurance that the transaction with caldera systems will be completed 
if the transaction with caldera systems is not completed the company will need to evaluate ways to further reduce costs in order to generate positive cash flows in the future or obtain additional financing until cash flows generated from the sale of the company s products are sufficient to meet expenses 
these cost reductions could include restructuring the company to reduce operating expenses to levels that could be financed by revenues generated 
such reductions in expenditures may include actions similar or greater in scope to the cost reduction exercises undertaken in fiscal there can be no assurance that such cost reduction measures would be successful in completely eliminating the difference between expenditures and revenues or that such actions would not have a harmful effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that if the company were to seek additional financing that it would be available at all or on terms which are acceptable to the company 
the company has received a commitment for credit financing of up to million from one of the stockholders of caldera under normal commercial terms that are currently under discussion 
further  caldera systems  inc  has agreed to loan million to the company in the form of a short term note repayable at the consummation of the transaction between the company and caldera systems  inc the company believes that  based on its current plans  which include the completion of the transaction with caldera discussed above  its existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  funds generated from operations and available borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements through fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
