k publishing the k publishing segment s net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase over net sales of million 
all divisions in this segment reported higher net sales in as compared to although sales opportunities were limited in elementary school reading and language arts  the school division s strongest markets and the markets to which its customers direct the most funding  the school division s net sales increased year over year 
this increase was due to the acquisition of discoveryworks and new product lines such as reading intervention and math steps 
great source reported increased net sales primarily due to higher sales of the write source product line and new products in mathematics and social studies 
riverside s slightly higher sales were primarily due to the increased sales in clinical and custom products  mostly offset by lower state contract sales 
mcdougal s net sales increased only slightly over and were lower than expected 
increases in social studies revenues were offset by lower than expected funding in both adoption and open territory states and lower math sales 
sunburst technology s net sales rose sharply  reflecting the may acquisition of sunburst communications 
operating income for the k publishing segment decreased million  or  to million in from million in the resulting operating margin for was compared to in this decrease in operating margin was primarily due to an increase in cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and intangible asset amortization 
cost of sales increased due to higher editorial expenses incurred for new program development and product revisions in preparation for sales opportunities in the year and beyond  partially offset by lower plate amortization 
selling expenses increased due to expansion of the sales staff and higher sampling and promotional expenses in anticipation of the increased sales opportunities in the year and beyond 
administrative expenses rose due to efforts to improve customer support systems and to address the year computer issue 
the shift of sunburst technology to the k publishing segment also accounted for some of the increase in selling and administrative costs 
the increase in intangible asset amortization was due to the acquisition of discoveryworks and the acquisitions of little planet and sunburst communications 
the k publishing segment s net sales of million in were million  or  above net sales of million 
this increase was due to strong sales performance in statewide adoption and open territory opportunities  as well as increased funding for instructional and assessment materials 
mcdougal s sales increased due to its strong performance in mathematics and social studies adoptions 
riverside reported an increase in sales due to higher sales of group assessment and clinical tests 
riverside benefited both from increased funding for assessment programs and from its strategy to invest in the development of criterion referenced tests 
great source had a significant sales increase  principally in its write source and mathematics product lines 
the school division s english  spelling  and new reading intervention programs performed extremely well in both adoption states and open territories 
the school division s reading program did not generate increased sales year over year  but sales from this product line were higher than originally expected 
the school division s math program had higher sales year over year  but less than originally expected 
overall  the school division had a year over year net sales gain  rather than the decline initially expected 
operating income for the k publishing segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the resulting operating margin for was compared to in the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the increase in editorial costs incurred for product revisions and new product development and a change in the mix of products sold  which included a higher percent of revenues from products with lower margins 
increased selling expense also contributed to this decrease 
higher selling expense was related to the cost of preparing for anticipated sales opportunities in the year over year increase in administrative expense as a percent of sales was primarily due to additional costs related to information systems initiatives and the year computer issue and the inclusion of gains recorded on the sales of property in  which  in turn  lowered administrative expense in college publishing the college publishing segment reported net sales of million  a increase over net sales of million

excluding the revenues from insight travel guides  which were no longer being distributed by this division after december  sales would have increased by more than 
the sales increase in this segment was also due to the inclusion of sales from cat  a new division acquired in lower net sales from sunburst technology partially offset these increases 
the other segment s operating loss was million in compared to million in the increased operating loss was primarily due to the operating loss attributable to houghton mifflin s acquisition of cat  the higher loss at sunburst technology due to lower sales  and costs incurred in moving the trade division s distribution facility in liquidity and capital resources houghton mifflin s principal businesses are seasonal  with almost of revenues derived from educational publishing in the k and college publishing segments  markedly seasonal businesses 
we realize approximately of net sales and a substantial portion of net income during the third quarter and characteristically posts a net loss in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this sales seasonality affects our operating cash flow 
houghton mifflin normally incurs a net cash deficit from all of our activities through the middle of the third quarter of the year 
we fund the deficit through the draw down of cash and marketable securities  supplemented by short term borrowings  principally commercial paper 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million from million in net income excluding non cash items increased million in from changes in operating assets and liabilities used million more cash in than due to an increase in tax payments and higher accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by higher accounts payable

houghton mifflin anticipates that cash provided by operating activities in will be higher than in due to higher earnings 
houghton mifflin used million in cash for investing activities in  an increase of million over the million used during the increase reflects a million increase for acquisitions of publishing and technology assets  a million increase for book plate expenditures  and a million increase in property  plant  and equipment expenditures 
the increases were principally due to the following the acquisitions of sunburst communications and the little planet literacy series and a contingent consideration payment related to the acquisition of cat  higher investments in new products  increased spending on information systems initiatives  and the build out of trade division s distribution facility 
houghton mifflin used million in cash for investing activities in  an increase of million over the million used during the increase reflected a million increase for acquisitions of publishing and technology assets  an increase in property  plant  and equipment expenditures of million incurred primarily for information systems initiatives in  and the million in proceeds from the sales of property and plant in we received million in proceeds from the sale of  ordinary shares of cassell plc in net proceeds from financing activities were million in  primarily due to the net issuance of million of debt partially offset by common stock repurchases of million and common stock dividend payments of million

the sails were redeemed at an exchange rate equal to two shares of the common stock of inso  par value per share  for each sails  or approximately million shares  and cash of million for the payment of accrued and unpaid interest at the date of the redemption 
on august   the remaining  or million in aggregate principal  of the outstanding sails matured 
in accordance with the terms of the sails  we elected to deliver two shares of the common stock of inso for each sails  or approximately million shares  and cash of million for the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding sails 
in may  houghton mifflin filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission covering up to million of debt securities and common stock  which may be issued in one or more offerings from time to time 
at december   we had not issued any debt securities or common stock covered by this registration statement 
at december   houghton mifflin had a million unsecured revolving credit facility for which we pay annual commitment fees 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are outstanding under a five year commitment revolving credit facility which expires on october  the revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants  the most restrictive of which include maintenance of a specific level of net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  and debt to equity ratio 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million  at a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million  at a weighted average interest rate of 
management routinely evaluates interest rates available to houghton mifflin under the revolving credit facility as compared to those available through the issuance of commercial paper 
houghton mifflin currently expects that cash flow from operations for the full year will be sufficient to cover investment activities and dividend payments as well as to repay by year end a portion of the debt outstanding at the beginning of we intend to continue using the short term debt market  primarily commercial paper  for seasonal liquidity needs 
pending accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  which was amended by financial accounting standards board statement no 
 which deferred the adoption of fas until fiscal years beginning after june  houghton mifflin is currently evaluating the effects of implementing this statement 
impact of inflation and changing prices although inflation is currently well below levels in prior years and has  therefore  benefited recent houghton mifflin results  particularly in the area of manufacturing costs  there are offsetting costs 
our ability to adjust selling prices has always been limited by competitive factors and long term contractual arrangements which either prohibit price increases or limit the amount by which prices may be increased 
further  a weak domestic economy at a time of low inflation could cause lower tax receipts at the state and local level  and the funding and buying patterns for textbooks and other educational materials could be adversely affected 
prices for paper moderated in and we expect a modest increase in paper prices in the most significant investments affected by inflation include book plates  other property  plant  and equipment  and inventories 
houghton mifflin uses the last in  first out lifo method to value substantially all inventory  and therefore  the cost of inventory charged against income approximates replacement value 
the incremental replacement cost expense amounted to million in compared with million in houghton mifflin s publishing business requires a high level of investment in book plates for our educational and reference works  which represented approximately of total assets at december   and  increasingly  in other property  plant  and equipment  which represented of consolidated assets at december  we expect to continue to commit funds to the publishing areas through both internal growth and acquisitions 
houghton mifflin believes that by valuing our inventory using the lifo method  continuing to emphasize technological improvements  and quality control  we can continue to moderate the impact of inflation on our operating results and financial position 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of cat in july  houghton mifflin wrote off in process research and development totaling million in the third quarter of the charge was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
this amount represents an allocation of the purchase price related to an application module called cat software system version this project represented an integrated application suite of products whose functionality included test development  automated assembly and test production  test administration  scoring  automated test reporting  and test security 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process research and development into a commercially viable product principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
we determined the value of the acquired in process research and development by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product and the stage of completion of the product and discounting these cash flows to the net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from the project were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the product 
the revenue estimates we used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in the related technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by houghton mifflin and our competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to the net present value were based on a discount rate of 
this discount rate took into account the time value of money and investment risk factors described above 
the estimates used in valuing the in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variances may adversely affect the sales and profitability of future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired 
the original estimate was to complete the development of cat software system version in at a cost of an additional million 
initial market availability of the product was expected by due to technology issues  the cat software system version release was cancelled 
instead  houghton mifflin decided to improve the product with a new release cat system software version although version will use some of the features created with version  the expected completion date is now early at an additional cost of approximately million 
outlook we expect that revenue opportunities in the k market in will be greater than in due to an increase in statewide adoption opportunities  as well as additional funding available at the state level for educational and assessment materials 
the sales growth will include the effect of having sunburst communications  inc for a full year 
we expect all other divisions will also have growth opportunities  and that sales will increase in by approximately 
houghton mifflin anticipates that the sales growth will generate increased gross margin due to a more favorable product mix  the completion of a major product development cycle  and the benefits from investments made in systems and business processes 
in the past two years  product development costs have increased in order to develop new programs for sale in major adoption opportunities in in  editorial expenses and plate amortization are expected to remain in the same absolute dollar range as in due to the higher sales expected in  editorial and plate amortization are expected to decrease as a percentage of sales  declining approximately two percentage points as compared to we expect selling and administrative expenses  which include selling  distribution  administrative costs  and intangible asset amortization to decrease as a percentage of sales  declining two to three percentage points in compared to each of the components is projected to decline as a percent of sales 
we expect selling expenses to increase due to increased sales and marketing efforts and product sampling associated with the adoption cycle for and  but as a percent of sales  to decline 
houghton mifflin expects distribution expenses will continue to decrease as a percent of sales  reflecting more efficient warehouse operations 
we believe administrative costs will benefit from process improvements as well as the resolution of the year computer issue  and due to higher sales  intangible asset amortization will decline as a percent of sales 
effect of the year computer issue houghton mifflin used both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test software for year modifications 
as of december   houghton mifflin had spent approximately million million expensed and million capitalized for new systems on its year computer project and the development of new systems and systems modifications 
to date  we have not experienced any material problems related to year issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk houghton mifflin s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our commercial paper program and our unsecured credit facility 
houghton mifflin does not enter into speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 
houghton mifflin from time to time enters into transactions involving financial instruments for purposes of managing our exposure to interest rate risks and funding costs 
through the use of interest rate products such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate locks  houghton mifflin attempts to achieve a predetermined mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   houghton mifflin had two interest rate swaps in place  each with a notional amount of million and terminating on december  we pay the fixed rate on both swaps and and receive a variable rate based upon a commercial paper index 
each interest rate swap agreement is designated with all or a portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation 
these agreements involve the exchange of amounts based on a variable interest rate for amounts based on a fixed interest rate over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the current period
