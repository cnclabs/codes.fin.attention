management believes that eclipsys commitment to quality  innovation  rapid product implementation and ongoing customer support has enabled it to build and maintain strong and stable customer relationships and positions it to capitalize on the opportunities for growth within its existing customer base 
industry the healthcare industry continues to undergo radical and rapid change 
through the s  the increasing cost of providing healthcare led the government sector  followed by the private sector  to develop new payment mechanisms that encouraged healthcare providers to contain costs 
this has caused the provider reimbursement environment to move away from the indemnity model  characterized by fee for service arrangements and traditional indemnity insurance  toward the managed care model  in which providers are aligned within networks and healthcare delivery must follow plan established rules to qualify for reimbursement 
as a result  the emphasis of healthcare providers has shifted from providing care regardless of cost to providing high quality care in the most cost effective manner possible 
many providers are realizing that the traditional method of cost containment cutting expenses is not by itself enough to maintain their competitiveness in the face of these pressures 
management believes that providers must also improve the processes by which healthcare is provided  including improving the quality of care  the efficiency with which it is delivered and patient and provider satisfaction 
in particular  healthcare providers are focusing on avoiding costly adverse clinical events 
recent events in the healthcare industry have brought the need for good quality yet cost effective care more sharply into focus 
the balanced budget act bba  passed by congress in  reduced the level of medicare funding to hospitals 
hardest hit by this legislation are the academic medical centers 
in late  the institute of medicine iom released a report on patient safety to err is human building a safer health system which documented the high incidence of avoidable medical errors that result in disabilities and death 
the report cites the issues of illegibility of medical orders as well as the unreasonable reliance on memory as key contributors to medical mistakes 
the regulations mandated by the healthcare information portability and accountability act hipaa will likely be finalized in the combination of reduced reimbursement as a result of bba  demands even requirements for improved patient safety instigated by the iom report  and requirements for improved access and security to patient information will place significant pressures on healthcare organizations 
eclipsys believes that the most effective means to cope with the pressures of this triple threat is through information 
traditional healthcare information systems are limited in their ability to support restructuring of healthcare delivery processes or the evolving requirements of integrated health networks actions that are demanded by the current pressures in healthcare 
such systems have generally been financially oriented  focusing primarily on the ability to capture charges and generate bills 
many information technology vendors have attempted to apply their existing financially oriented systems to meet the demand for clinical solutions 
however  because these systems were not originally developed to address clinical requirements  they often lack the basic structure and functionality to support better overall management of costs  care quality  outcome measurement and patient satisfaction across the healthcare delivery continuum 
moreover  because these vendors historically developed and marketed such systems primarily to financial managers  physicians  who 
table of contents influence a significant portion of variable direct healthcare costs  were often excluded from the design of healthcare information systems and from the system selection process 
in addition  traditional systems were typically designed to operate in a single facility  which has made them less effective in today s widely dispersed integrated health networks 
the growth of the managed care environment  the rise of integrated health networks and the pervasive acceptance of the internet has created an opportunity for new healthcare information technology products and services 
healthcare providers are increasingly demanding integrated solutions that offer all of the core functions required to manage the entire healthcare delivery process 
these core functions include clinical management  access management  patient financial management  health information management him and enterprise resource planning erp solutions 
in addition  large and widely spread health networks require decision support tools that permit them to effectively analyze past performance  model new plans for the future and measure and monitor the effectiveness of those plans to measure clinical results and return on investment and to support process improvement 
these solutions must also allow providers to preserve their investment in existing legacy applications and technologies  which often are significant and vary from facility to facility 
sophisticated  web based integration tools are required to achieve the level of information integration needed together with ease of access 
finally  active physician use of healthcare information technology is necessary for these solutions to improve clinical outcomes 
eclipsys believes that active physician use will increase as information technology solutions provide greater functionality  including internet based access  alerts  reminders  sub second response times  just in time clinical decision support and an intuitive browser based user interfaces 
historically  the healthcare industry has invested relatively less in technology compared to certain other industries 
eclipsys believes that healthcare providers are realizing that a relatively small investment in healthcare information technology can significantly reduce variable costs 
as a result of industry trends  healthcare providers are making significant investments in healthcare information technology solutions that capitalize on evolving information management technologies 
industry analysts estimate that healthcare organizations spent approximately billion in for information technology solutions  and anticipate that such expenditures will increase to approximately billion annually by strategy eclipsys objective is to become the leading provider of healthcare information technology solutions to meet the needs of the healthcare industry as it consolidates and evolves 
key elements of eclipsys strategy to achieve this objective include provide comprehensive  integrated healthcare information technology solutions 
eclipsys is focused on providing a full suite of clinical management  access management  patient financial management  strategic decision support  health information management  enterprise resource planning and enterprise application integration solutions 
eclipsys solutions are positioned to focus on the physician as the agent of change by providing actionable information at the point of decision  providing automated processes that improve clinical workflow and supporting clinical decision making by appropriately communicating credible clinical rules and reminders  promote balanced outcomes by integrating clinical  financial and satisfaction information to support balanced decision making ensuring the healthcare organizations have the information they need to understand the overall effect of their decisions as they re define process to become more clinically effective and efficient  provide end to end solutions to focus on solving the business issues in healthcare organizations must solve  partnering with our customers to understand their particular needs and crafting a solution that both solves their problems while leveraging their existing systems  and solve the efficiency equation in healthcare improving quality while reducing cost by connecting and leveraging information flow that supports supply chain management 

table of contents further penetrate existing customer base 
eclipsys believes there is a significant opportunity to sell its integrated healthcare technology solutions to its existing customers 
eclipsys has at least one of its products installed or being installed in more than  facilities 
of these customers  only a few have an enterprise wide healthcare information system 
eclipsys believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunity within its existing customer base as a result of several factors internet strategy  sophisticated proven integration technology that solves customers current integration problems while retaining investment in existing systems  the ability of its products to work with a customer s existing information systems  the ability to document clinical benefits and return on investment  management s industry experience and relationships  alignment of its pricing and payment schedule with the value received by its customers  and its ongoing customer support and service programs 
employ a targeted marketing approach 
eclipsys target market primarily includes large hospitals  integrated health networks and academic medical centers 
eclipsys believes that these entities are the first to adopt new technology and are the drivers of industry consolidation 
as the size and complexity of these customers grow  their need for integrated information technology solutions increases 
eclipsys has identified potential new customers  including those who are currently relying on legacy systems that lack the functions and features such customers require  and is targeting decision makers within these entities 
in particular  eclipsys believes that physicians are becoming increasingly involved in the information technology selection process as recent technological developments and the impact of managed care have increased the utility of information systems to physicians 
eclipsys believes that it s clinically oriented  physician designed products provide it with an advantage as it competes for business 
eclipsys also leverages the extensive industry experience of its senior management and sales force  as well as its strategic relationships with leading institutions such as bwh and mgh  to pursue this opportunity 
continue to enhance and develop new solutions

eclipsys has a team of approximately internal research  development and technical support professionals dedicated to developing  enhancing  supporting and commercializing new and enhanced healthcare information technology products 
eclipsys also has an exclusive right of first offer to commercialize certain new information technologies developed in connection with partners 
in addition  eclipsys relationship with partners allows it to test new and existing products in a potential forum that provides feedback from medical and administrative users  which eclipsys believes gives it a competitive advantage in developing new products 
pursue selected acquisitions 
eclipsys intends to continue pursuing selected acquisitions that will enhance its product line  customer base  technological capabilities and management team 
historically  eclipsys has experienced significant growth through acquisitions  and intends to continue to target acquisitions that will help it achieve its overall strategic goals

eclipsys research and development expenses were million for competition the market for eclipsys products and services is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving user needs and the frequent introduction of new products 
eclipsys principal competitors include cerner corp  mckesson hboc inc  idx systems corp 
and sms 
eclipsys also faces competition from providers of practice management systems  general decision support and database systems and other segment specific applications  as well as from healthcare technology consultants 
a number of eclipsys competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than eclipsys 
eclipsys also expects that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries 
eclipsys believes that the principal factors affecting competition in the healthcare information technology market include product functionality  performance  flexibility and features  use of open standards technology  quality of service and support  company reputation  price and overall cost of ownership 
proprietary rights eclipsys is dependent upon its proprietary information and technology 
eclipsys relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect its rights in its software products and other proprietary technology 
eclipsys requires third party consultants and contractors to enter into nondisclosure agreements to limit use of  access to and distribution of its proprietary information 
in addition  eclipsys currently requires employees who receive stock option grants under any of its stock option plans to enter into nondisclosure agreements 
there can be no assurance that eclipsys means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect eclipsys proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as do the laws of the united states 
also  despite the steps taken by eclipsys to protect its proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of eclipsys products  reverse engineer such products or otherwise obtain and use information that eclipsys regards as proprietary 
in certain limited instances  customers can access source code versions of eclipsys software  subject to contractual limitations on the permitted use of such source code 
although eclipsys license agreements with such customers attempt to prevent misuse of the source code  the possession of eclipsys source code by third parties increases the ease and likelihood of potential misappropriation of such software 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not 
table of contents independently develop technologies similar or superior to eclipsys technology or design around the proprietary rights owned by eclipsys 
employees as of february   eclipsys employed  people  including approximately  in field operations sales  account management  implementation and education  in research  development and product delivery  and in marketing  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative functions 
the success of eclipsys depends on its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense in the information technology industry  particularly for talented software developers  service consultants  and sales and marketing personnel 
there can be no assurance that eclipsys will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
eclipsys employees are not represented by any labor unions 
eclipsys considers its relations with its employees to be good 
certain factors that may affect future operating results risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before you decide to buy our voting common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations would likely suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our voting common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
limited operating history of eclipsys  history of operating losses 
we began operations in and have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions completed since january accordingly  there is only a limited combined operating history of eclipsys and its acquired operations upon which to base an evaluation of eclipsys and its prospects 
we will continue to integrate the operations of the businesses we acquired and to consolidate their product offerings 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception  including net losses of million in  million in and million in these losses resulted primarily from certain write offs related to acquisitions we completed during and  and charges in the first quarter of related to the buyout by us of certain obligations under an agreement entered into in connection with one of the acquisitions 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we cannot predict when or if we will achieve profitability 
management of growth 
the rapid growth in the size and complexity of our business as a result of our acquisitions has placed a significant strain on our management and other resources 
to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  we will need to implement and improve operational and financial systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
risks associated with future acquisitions 
an important element of our business strategy has been expansion through acquisitions 
we expect to continue this strategy 
this acquisition strategy involves a number of risks  which include there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities in the healthcare information technology industry 
competition may intensify due to consolidation in the industry  which could increase the costs of future acquisitions 
we will compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies  some of which may have significantly greater financial and management resources than we have 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisition may not be achieved unless the operations of the acquired business are successfully combined with ours 
the integration of acquired businesses requires substantial attention from management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could hurt us 

table of contents future acquisitions could result in the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness  could entail the payment of consideration in excess of book value and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share 
many business acquisitions must be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
consequently  such acquisitions may generate significant goodwill or other intangible assets and result in substantial amortization charges to us 
acquisitions could also involve significant one time charges 
potential fluctuations in quarterly performance 
we have experienced significant variations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of future acquisitions  the timing  size and nature of our product sales and implementations  the length of the sales cycle  the success of implementation efforts  market acceptance of new services  products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  product and price competition  the relative proportions of revenues derived from systems and services and from hardware  changes in operating expenses  personnel changes  the performance of our products  and fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions 
it is difficult to predict the timing of revenues from product sales because the sales cycle can vary depending upon several factors 
these factors include the size of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of the customer s management and general economic conditions 
in addition  because revenue is recognized at various points during the term of a contract  the timing of revenue recognition varies considerably 
factors affecting the timing of revenue recognition include the type of contract  the availability of personnel  the implementation schedule and the complexity of the implementation process 
because a significant percentage of our expenses will be relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of sales and implementations could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance 
long sales and implementation cycles 
we have experienced long sales and implementation cycles 
how and when to implement  replace  expand or substantially modify an information system  or modify or add business processes or lines of business  are major decisions for customers 
furthermore  the license of solutions like those we provide typically require significant capital expenditures by the customer 
the sales cycle for our systems has ranged from to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
historically  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months from contract execution to completion of implementation 
although we believe that the migration of our products to our new sola platform will significantly shorten the implementation cycle  we cannot provide any assurance in this regard 
during the sales cycle and the implementation cycle  we will expend substantial time  effort and funds preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the solution 
risks associated with our development of our integrated clinical management suite 
we are currently in the process of integrating selected features and functionalities from a number of clinical management products acquired in our mergers and acquisitions and licensed from partners  to create the sunrise clinical manager suite 
during  the product was under field trials in several customer sites 
in 
table of contents late  we generally released the product 
we will continue to integrate additional functionality that was acquired in the acquisitions and licensed from partners during the next several years 
although  the product has been generally released  there can be no assurance that future integration efforts will be successful or that the product will meet the needs of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
competition 
we operate in a market that is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cerner corp  mckesson hboc  inc  idx systems corp 
and shared medical systems corporation 
we will also face competition from providers of practice management systems  general decision support and database systems and other segment specific applications  as well as from healthcare technology consultants 
a number of existing and potential competitors are more established and have greater name recognition and financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries 
dependence on relationship with partners and other third parties 
we have an exclusive license granted by partners to develop  commercialize  distribute and support certain intellectual property relating to clinical information systems software developed at bwh 
if we breach certain terms of the license  then partners has the option to convert the license to a non exclusive license 
such conversion by partners could cause the intellectual property and the ability to develop and commercialize such intellectual property to become more widely available to our competitors 
we also work closely with physicians and research and development personnel at bwh and its affiliate  mgh  to develop and commercialize new information technology solutions for the healthcare industry and to test and demonstrate new and existing products 
if we fail to maintain the cooperative working relationship with bwh and mgh  including future access to products developed by personnel at bwh granted under the partners license  could become strained or cease altogether 
the loss of good relations with bwh or mgh could hurt our ability to develop new solutions and could cause delays in bringing new products to the market 
in addition  our reputation and status in the industry could be hurt 
additionally  we depend upon licenses for certain technology used in our products from a number of third party vendors  including computer corporation of america  computer associates  oracle corporation and sterling software united states of america  inc we also have licenses from premier  inc for certain comparative database systems and other software components and clinical benchmarking data 
most of these licenses expire within one to four years  can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time 
we may not be able to continue using the technology licensed under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as a result  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments until equivalent technology is obtained  which could hurt us 
most of our third party licenses  including our license from new england medical center  inc  for the original version of the transition i software  are non exclusive 
our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by the licenses and use the technology to directly compete with us 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products going forward 
uncertainty in the healthcare industry 
we operate in an industry subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
the potential impact of these industry changes include during the past several years  the us healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and reform proposals  such as the federal balanced budget act of and the health insurance portability and accountability act of these reforms may increase governmental involvement in healthcare  continue to reduce reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our customers 
customers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding the proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our products and services 
some healthcare providers may fail  creating potential bad debt losses for eclipsys 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create larger healthcare delivery enterprises with greater market power 
this consolidation could erode our customer base and could reduce the size 
table of contents of our target market 
in addition  the resulting enterprises could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to price erosion 
potential fda regulation 
the us food and drug administration is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in the healthcare setting 
the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computer assisted products as medical devices under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices  it can impose extensive requirements upon us  including we would be required to seek either fda clearance of a pre market notification submission demonstrating that the product is substantially equivalent to a device already legally marketed or obtain fda approval of a pre market approval application establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product  we would be required to comply with rigorous regulations governing the pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of medical devices  and we would be required to comply with the fdc act s general controls  including establishment registration  device listing  compliance with good manufacturing practices  reporting of certain device malfunctions and adverse device events 
if we failed to comply with applicable requirements  then the fda could respond by imposing fines  injunctions or civil penalties  requiring recalls or product corrections  suspending production  refusing to grant pre market clearance or approval of products  withdrawing clearances and approvals  and initiating criminal prosecution 
any final fda policy governing computer products  once issued  may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products 
new regulations relating to patient confidentiality 
state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information 
regulations governing electronic health data transmissions are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
on august   president clinton signed the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
this legislation requires the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  to i adopt national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  ii adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information  and iii establish a schedule for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations 
a notice of proposed rule making nprm for transaction standards was published in may it addresses seven of the nine stipulated transactions 
the data standards  which have been proposed  are expected to be issued as final rules in late  to become effective in we believe that the proposed data standards issued to date would not materially affect our business if adopted as proposed 
we cannot predict the potential impact of the standards that have not yet been proposed or any other standards that might be finally adopted instead of the proposed standards 
the hipaa legislation challenged congress to enact privacy legislation that includes healthcare information within three years and directed the secretary of hhs to issue healthcare information privacy regulations if congress did not act 
congress had not acted on privacy legislation by the august  deadline  prompting the secretary to issue proposed rules for the privacy of individually identifiable health information on nov 
 in addition  federal and or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time 
such legislation  if enacted  could also require patient consent before even non individually identifiable eg  coded or anonymous patient information may be shared with third parties and could require that holders or users of such information implement specified security measures 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our products 

table of contents potential for product liability  security issues 
we provide products with applications that relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if these products fail to provide accurate and timely information  customers could assert liability claims against us 
we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
despite this precaution  the limitations of liability set forth in these contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions 
however  such coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims 
in addition  the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
one or more large claims could exceed available insurance coverage 
litigation with respect to liability claims  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  could divert management s attention from operations and could decrease market acceptance of the our products 
we have included security features in our products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data 
despite the existence of these security features  these products may be vulnerable to break ins and similar disruptive problems 
break ins and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of customers 
we may need to expend significant capital and other resources to address evolving security issues 
ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends  in significant part  upon the continued services of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
competition for technical  marketing  sales and management employees is intense and the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our strategy can be difficult  time consuming and expensive 
we believe that our ability to implement our strategic goals depends to a considerable degree on our senior management team 
the loss of any member of that team or  in particular  the loss of harvey j 
wilson  our founder  chairman of the board and member of the office of the chairman  could hurt our business 
rapid technological change and evolving market 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the healthcare information technology market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
the process of developing products and services such as those offered by us is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced 
we have commenced migrating our products to the sola architecture 
we cannot assure you that the development of sola or the migration of products to sola will be successful that such products will meet their scheduled release dates  that we will successfully complete the development and release of other new products or the migration of new or existing products to specific platforms or configurations in a timely fashion or that our current or future products will satisfy the needs of potential customers or gain general market acceptance 
limited protection of proprietary rights 
we are dependent upon our proprietary information and technology 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully nor in the same manner as do the laws of the united states 
also  despite the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products  reverse engineer such products or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in certain limited instances  customers can access source code versions of our software  subject to contractual limitations on the permitted use of such source code 
although our license agreements with such customers attempt to prevent misuse of the source code  the possession of our source code by third parties increases the ease and likelihood of potential misappropriation of such software 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the our proprietary rights 
in addition  although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot assure you that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification 
table of contents resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regardless of the validity of such claims  defending against such claims could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the assertion of such infringement claims could result in injunctions preventing us from distributing certain products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license to such intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you  however  that such a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
product errors 
highly complex software products such as ours often contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
testing of our products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy these products 
despite extensive testing  we from time to time have discovered defects or errors in our products 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that such defects  errors or difficulties will not cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with our products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations

as a result of the foregoing factors  net loss decreased from million in to million in acquired in process research and development in connection with the alltel  sdk and healthvision acquisitions  the company wrote off in process research and development totaling million and million in and million in  respectively 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
the company is using the acquired in process research and development to create new clinical management  access management  patient financial management and data warehousing products  which will become part of the sunrise product suite over the next several years 
certain products using the acquired in process technology were generally released during  with additional product releases expected in subsequent periods through the company expects that the acquired in process research and development will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of these products will be achieved 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
these estimates were based on several assumptions  including those summarized below for each of the respective acquisitions 
if these projects to develop commercial products based on the acquired in process technology are not successfully completed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired 

table of contents alltel the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the alltel acquisition was the client server based core application modules of the tds product 
this project represented an integrated clinical software product whose functionality included order management  health information management  physician applications  nursing applications  pharmacy  laboratory and radiology applications and ancillary support 
additionally  the product included functionality facilitating the gathering and analysis of data throughout a healthcare organization  a data integration engine and various other functionality 
revenue attributable to the in process technology was assumed to increase over the twelve year projection period at annual rates ranging from to  resulting in annual revenues of approximately million to million 
such projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base  new customer transactions  historical retention rates and experiences of prior product releases 
the projections reflect accelerated revenue growth in the first five years to as the products derived from the in process technology are generally released 
in addition  the projections were based on annual revenue to be derived from long term contractual arrangements ranging from seven to ten years 
new customer contracts for products developed from the in process technology were assumed to peak in  with rapidly declining sales volume in the years to as other new products were expected to enter the market 
the projections assumed no new customer contracts after projected revenue in years after was determined using a annual growth rate  which reflected contractual increases 
operating profit was projected to grow over the projection period at rates ranging from to  resulting in incremental annual operating profit loss of approximately million to million 
the operating profit projections during the years to assumed a growth rate slightly higher than the revenue projections 
the higher growth rate is attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above  together with research and development costs expected to remain constant at approximately million annually 
the operating profit projections include a annual growth rate for the years after consistent with the revenue projections 
through december   revenues and operating profit attributable to the acquired in process technology have not materially differed from the projections used in determining its value 
throughout  the company has continued the development of the in process technology that was acquired in the alltel transaction 
to date  the company is installing modules derived from the acquired in process technology in various field trial sites that were activated at the end of additionally  the company has begun to successfully market certain aspects of the technology to new and existing customers 
the company expects to continue releasing products derived from the technology through management continues to believe the projections used reasonably estimate the future benefits attributable to the in process technology 
however  no assurance can be given that deviations from these projections will not occur 
the projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using the weighted average cost of capital the wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the wacc used in the projections was 
this rate was determined by applying the capital asset pricing model 
this method yielded an estimated average wacc of approximately 
a risk premium was added to reflect the business risks associated with the stage of development of the company  as well as the technology risk associated with the in process software  resulting in a wacc of 
in addition  the value of customer relationships was calculated using a discount rate of and a return to net tangible assets was estimated using a rate of return of 
the value of the goodwill was calculated as the remaining intangible value not otherwise allocated to identifiable intangible assets resulting in an implied discount rate on the goodwill of approximately 
the company used a discount rate for valuing existing technology because it faces substantially the same risks as the business as a whole 
accordingly  a rate equal to the wacc of was used 
the company used a discount rate for valuing in process technology 
the spread over the existing technology discount rate reflects the inherently greater risk of the research and development efforts 
the spread reflected the 
table of contents nature of the development efforts relative to the existing base of technology and the potential market for the in process technology once the products were released 
the company estimates that the costs to develop the purchased in process technology acquired in the alltel acquisition into commercially viable products will be approximately million in the aggregate through million per year from to 
sdk the purchased in process technology acquired in the sdk acquisition comprised three major enterprise wide modules in the areas of physician billing  home health care billing and long term care billing  a graphical user interface  a corporate master patient index  and a standard query language module 
revenue attributable to the in process technology was assumed to increase in the first three years of the ten year projection period at annual rates ranging from to decreasing over the remaining years at annual rates ranging from to as other products are released in the market place 
projected annual revenue ranged from approximately million to million over the term of the projections 
these projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base  synergies as a result of the sdk acquisition  new customer transactions and historical retention rates 
projected revenues from the in process technology were assumed to peak in and decline from to as other new products were expected to enter the market 
operating profit was projected to grow over the projection period at annual rates ranging from to during the first three years  decreasing during the remaining years of the projection period similar to the revenue growth projections described above 
projected annual operating profit ranged from approximately  to million over the term of the projections 
through december   revenues and operating profit attributable to in process technology have been consistent with the projections 
however  no assurance can be given that deviations from these projections will not occur in the future 
the wacc used in the analysis was 
this rate was determined by applying the capital asset pricing model and a review of venture capital rates of return for companies in a similar life cycle stage 
the company used a discount rate for valuing existing and in process technology because both technologies face substantially the same risks as the business as a whole 
accordingly  a rate equal to the wacc of was used 
the company estimates that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the sdk acquisition will be approximately million in the aggregate through the year  in   in and  in 
transition in connection with the purchase transaction of healthvision  based on an independent appraisal  the company recorded million of intangible assets which consisted of million of acquired in process research and development 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented development projects in areas that had not reached technological feasibility and which had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amount was charged to operations at the date of the acquisition 
backlog backlog consists of revenues the company expects to recognize over the following twelve months under existing contracts 
the revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one time fees for software licensing and implementation  hardware sales and installations and professional service  or annual or monthly fees for licenses  maintenance  and outsourcing or remote hosting services 
as of december   the company had a backlog of approximately million
