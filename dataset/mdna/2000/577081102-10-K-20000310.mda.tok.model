foreign currency risk mattel s results of operations and cash flows can be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
to limit the exposure associated with exchange rate movements  mattel enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts primarily to hedge its purchase of inventory  sales and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
mattel s results of operations can also be affected by the translation of foreign revenues and earnings into us dollars 
market risk exposures exist with respect to the settlement of foreign currency transactions during the year because currency fluctuations cannot be predicted with certainty 
mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to market risk by monitoring its currency exchange exposure for the year and partially or fully hedging such exposure 
in addition  mattel manages its exposure through the selection of currencies used for foreign borrowings and intercompany invoicing 
mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes

these contracts generally mature within months from the date of execution 
contracts outstanding at year end mature during the next months

a risk of political instability and civil unrest exists in these countries  which could temporarily or permanently damage mattel s manufacturing operations located there 
mattel s business  financial position and results of operations would be negatively impacted by a significant disruption to its manufacturing operations or suppliers 
effects of inflation inflation rates in the us and in major foreign countries where mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during the three years ended december  the us consumer price index increased in  in and in mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability to pass on higher prices to consumers 
year update to address the year issue  in early mattel established an in house project team and initiated a comprehensive plan to assess  remediate and test mattel s internal systems  hardware and processes  including key operational  manufacturing and financial systems 
the plan also included steps to verify that all key third party suppliers and customers were taking measures to ensure their own readiness and timely implementation 
all phases of the year readiness plan were completed as scheduled 
to date  mattel has not experienced any year issues with its internal operating systems or with its third party customers and suppliers 
in addition  mattel did not experience any loss in revenues due to the year issue 
all software products currently available for sale to consumers and under development are year compliant 
however  several discontinued products sold in the past may not operate as intended on certain computers due to the year issue 
as of december   mattel spent a total of approximately million in connection with addressing the year issue 
any additional charges are expected to be minimal 
these costs were largely due to the use of internal resources dedicated to achieving year compliance  and were charged to expense as incurred 
all costs of addressing the year issue were funded from internally generated cash 
although unlikely given that mattel has not experienced any year issues to date  there can be no assurance that any future unforeseen year issues or year issues relating to possibly non compliant software products will not materially adversely affect mattel s results of operations  liquidity and financial position or adversely affect mattel s relationships with customers  vendors or others
