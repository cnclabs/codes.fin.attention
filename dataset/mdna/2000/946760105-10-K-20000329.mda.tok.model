the company is using its european based operations as a platform for pan european business development  including the distribution of local versions of its catalogs 
the company has experienced in the past and will experience in the future seasonal variations in net sales and net income 
factors that have contributed to seasonal operating results include product cycles of suppliers that are not controlled or influenced by the company  product availability  supplier relationships  customer licenses and contracts  the timing of catalog mailings  catalog response rates  product mix  past and potential acquisitions  the condition of the software industry in general  traditional softness in summertime european commercial activity  shifts in demand for software products and industry announcements  releases of new products and upgrades and corporate purchasing cycles 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial information derived from the company s consolidated statement of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales to net sales change for the years ended december  v v net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill income loss from operations interest income  expense net unrealized foreign exchange gain loss income loss before taxes provision for income tax net income loss net sales net sales of the company represents the gross consolidated revenue of the company less returns 
although net sales consist primarily of sales of software  revenue from marketing services and advertising is also included within net sales 
net sales of the company increased by million or to million in  and by million or  to million in as compared to the respective preceding periods 
the increase in revenues in is primarily attributable to growth in the direct sales channel 
revenues within the direct sales channel increased or million in the company posted gains in the direct sales channel domestically and also in france  which grew by and  respectively 
revenues within the catalog channel increased from by approximately to million 
most catalog customers are individual programmers and developers and as such  were extensively involved in yk conversion projects and therefore delaying other development projects 
in addition  no significant new technical software products were introduced into the channel during the second half of due to potential concerns surrounding yk issues 
the growth in net sales in resulted from a strong growth in the direct sales channel 
revenues within the direct sales channel increased or million in  the majority of which resulted from the acquisition of logicsoft in september the company also posted strong gains in the direct sales channel in both france and germany  which grew by and  respectively 
revenues within the catalog channel declined from by approximately to million primarily due to the yk issue as well as the lack of new products being introduced 
most catalog customers are individual programmers and developers and as such  were extensively involved in yk conversion projects and therefore delaying scheduled development projects 
in addition  no significant new technical software products were introduced during with the exception of microsoft s upgrades for visual c and visual basic in september gross profit gross profit represents the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales is composed primarily of amounts paid by the company to publishers and vendors plus catalog printing and mailing costs 
publisher and vendor rebates are credited against cost of sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by in from to reflecting a shift in the mix of sales through the company s distribution channels as a result of the substantial increase in lower margin direct sales and microsoft select licensing sales 
in the past  gross margins have been affected by the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels 
historically  the gross margins attained in the catalog channel have been higher than either the direct sales or distribution channels 
in  catalog operations contributed approximately of revenue and approximately of gross margin dollars as compared with of revenue and of gross margin dollars in direct sales operations contributed approximately of revenue and approximately of gross margin dollars in and of revenue and of gross margin dollars in the distribution channel contributed approximately of revenue and approximately of gross margin dollars in compared with of revenue and of margin dollars in the historically higher margins attained in the catalog channel are related to both the product focus on technical software  including numerous specialized products  and on the relatively fragmented customer base of the catalog channel  in comparison to the direct sales channel  which primarily serves large corporations purchasing high volumes of widely available business applications 
in the future  the company s gross margins will be affected by several factors  including  among others  the price of products sold  the distribution channel used  increases in product costs  price competition and the introduction of new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all corporate personnel costs including salaries and health benefits  depreciation and amortization  non personnel related marketing and administrative costs and provision for doubtful accounts 
depreciation and amortization consists primarily of equipment depreciation and leasehold improvements amortization 
sg a expenses have decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in and then had a slight increase to of net revenues in the decline in sg a expense as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to the increase in revenues in the reseller channel  which has generally lower sg a costs as a percentage of revenues and also the impact of the acquisition of logicsoft holding bv 
this is further exemplified by the percentage reduction in sg a as a percentage of revenues in as the full year impact of the acquisition of logicsoft was felt as well as certain economies of scale that were realized 
the slight increase in sg a expense as a percent of revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in staff within the internet development and commerce teams 
each year sg a has increased in absolute dollars  reflecting the cost of operations of the company s acquisitions such as the programmer s supershop  system science  isp d and logicsoft holding bv 
the company anticipates that sg a as a percentage of revenues will decline as revenues continue to grow and cost containment directives remain in place  however  there can be no assurances that this will occur 
amortization amortization expense includes the systematic write off of goodwill 
the company recorded goodwill with the acquisition of both isp d and lifeboat italia which it is amortizing over years 
in addition  the company recorded goodwill in conjunction with the acquisition of both systematika ltd 
and isp f international software partners france 
the company recognized approximately million in goodwill from the acquisition of the assets of the software developer s company  inc in june  which is being amortized over a fifteen year period for both financial and tax accounting purposes 
during  the company recorded a one time charge for the write off of goodwill associated with lifeboat italia  srl  which amounted to approximately  as a result of poor operating results and taking into consideration projected cash flows

upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends  the company would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements created by its sales growth and to make acquisitions 
historically  the company s primary sources of financing have been borrowings under its domestic and international lines of credit with financial institutions and the issuance of common and preferred stock 
cash flows provided by operations were  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for and  respectively

domestically  the company has a committed line of credit whereby it can borrow up to  with interest at either the prime rate or euro rate plus basis points 
the facility expires on june  and is secured by all the domestic assets of the company and of the outstanding stock of the foreign subsidiaries and contains certain covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and working capital 
at december   there was  outstanding under the line 
at december   the company was in default of its consolidated leverage ratio covenant under its line of credit agreement 
the company received a waiver for the default as of december  the company expects to meet its covenant requirements under the line of credit agreement in  however if the covenant requirements are not met  additional waivers may be needed 
the company maintains a secured  demand revolving line of credit for its german subsidiary  pursuant to which it may borrow in deutschmarks up to dm  the equivalent of approximately  at december   based upon its eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  and the creditor is entitled to the benefit of a limited guarantee by the company of up to dm  the equivalent of approximately  at december  
the line bears interest at 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the line 
in italy  lifeboat italy has banking arrangements with several italian banks  pursuant to which it may borrow in lire on an unsecured  demand basis to finance working capital requirements  through credit and overdrafting privileges  as well as receivables based advances 
the aggregate credit and overdraft limits of such arrangements at december  were approximately lit  the equivalent of approximately  at december  
the unsecured borrowings bear interest at market rates ranging from to 
at december  there were no amounts outstanding under this line 
the company s subsidiary in the netherlands  logicsoft holding  bv  maintains a demand revolving line of credit pursuant to which it may borrow in guilders up to dfl  the equivalent of approximately  at december   and is secured by its accounts receivable and inventory 
the line bears interest at 
there were no amounts outstanding under this line at december  foreign exchange the company s shipments to foreign subsidiaries are invoiced in us dollars 
as a result  the company believes its foreign exchange exposure caused by these shipments is insignificant 
the company is  however  exposed to exchange conversion differences in translating foreign results of operations to us dollars 
depending upon the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  these conversion differences could be significant 
sales to the customers in european countries and borrowings by the company s european subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
the company does not hedge its net asset exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar against any such local currency exchange rates 
although the company does maintain bank accounts in local currencies to reduce currency exchange fluctuations  the company is  nevertheless  subject to risks associated with such fluctuations 
update on year computer issues the company did not experience any computer or systems problems relating to the year upon review of its internal and external systems during  the company determined that it did not have any material exposure to such computer problems and that the software and systems required to operate its business and provide services were year compliant 
as a result  the company did not incur  and does not expect to incur  any material expenditures relating to year systems remediation 
certain factors affecting operating results certain statements contained in  or incorporated by reference in  this form k are forward looking in nature 
such statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  will  should or anticipates or the negative thereof or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy 
the company wishes to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements  so as to ensure to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the reader that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
the company operates in a rapidly changing business  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
management cannot predict every risk factor  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of all such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
competition 
the direct marketing industry and the computer software distribution business  in particular  are highly competitive 
the company competes with consumer electronic and computer retail stores  including superstores  and other direct marketers of software and computer related products 
certain software vendors are selling their products directly through their own catalogs and over the internet 
certain competitors of the company have financial  marketing and other resources greater than those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to increased price competition 
an increase in the amount of competition faced by the company or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality 
the company s sales and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the condition of the software industry in general  shifts in demand for software products  industry shipments of new software products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays  and changes in the company s product offerings 
the company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the company has traditionally experienced a decrease in domestic net sales in its third quarter compared to other quarters 
this traditional downturn in domestic net sales is exacerbated by the decline of european commercial activity in general and software sales in particular during the summer months 
foreign operations 
in addition to its activities in the united states  of the company s sales were generated internationally 
foreign operations are subject to general risks attendant to the conduct of business in each foreign country  including economic uncertainties and each foreign government s regulations 
in addition  the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance 
the company mails catalogs and sends electronic messages to names in its proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names are obtained from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
there has been increasing worldwide public concern regarding right to privacy issues involved with the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management information systems 
the company s success is dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of its management information systems  including its telephone and internet system 
the company s ability to manage its inventory and accounts receivable collections  to purchase  sell and ship its products efficiently and on a timely basis  and to maintain its operations is dependent upon the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by its management information systems 
the company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database 
in that regard  the company anticipates that it will  from time to time  require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems 
increases in postage  shipping and paper costs 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could have a significant impact on the cost of production and mailing of the company s catalogs and the shipment of customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically  and the company has no control over increases that may occur in the future 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and significant increases have been experienced by the company in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations  particularly to the extent the company is unable to pass on such increases directly to its customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
in addition  strikes or other service interruptions by the postal service or third party couriers could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
new software releases 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected by a delay in the introduction of a major new software product or upgrading of more specialized products 
purchasers of software may delay the ordering of new software applications in the period immediately preceding such introduction for fear of technological obsolescence 
the company believes that software publishers often delay the release of related software products so as to coordinate with the release of these major new products or delay development of new products until after the importance of these new products can be evaluated 
delayed introductions of these new products could result in the delay or reduction of sales because the unreleased product cannot be delivered and could also adversely affect sales in that the company  which often coordinates new catalog drops and marketing initiatives with such introductions and product upgrades  would be focusing catalog marketing on such unreleased products 
changing methods of software distribution 
the software distribution industry is undergoing significant change and consolidation 
software distributors are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other distributors or retailers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency 
the current consolidation trend could cause the industry to become even more competitive and make it more difficult for the company to maintain its operating margins 
the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is also changing  and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand 
software developers and publishers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
the emergence of the internet as a viable platform in which to conduct business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customers access to products and information 
this transition has heightened the company s awareness to maintain a competitive edge in this market 
from time to time certain developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers 
while microsoft and other vendors currently sell their products directly to end users  they have not attempted to completely bypass the reseller channel 
future efforts by such entities to bypass third party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the company s operations 
in addition  certain major publishers  including microsoft  have implemented programs for the master copy distribution or site licensing of software 
these programs generally grant an organization the right to make a number of copies of software for distribution within the organization provided that the organization pays a fee to the developer for each copy made 
also  resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through downloading to end users microcomputers  through cd rom unlocking technology  through cd rom based subscription services and through on line shopping services 
any of these competitive programs  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
dependence upon vendors 
as is customary in the industry  the company has no long term supply contracts with any of its suppliers 
substantially all the company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon days notice or less 
termination or interruption of the company s relationships with its suppliers or modification of the terms of or discontinuance of their agreements with the company could adversely affect the company s operating results 
certain of the products offered by the company may be subject to manufacturer allocations  which limit the number of units of manufacturers products available to resellers  including the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected if certain products become unavailable to the company or if the number of units allocated to the company becomes limited  whether such unavailability or limitation is due to the loss of authorized dealer status  allocation limitations or other conditions 
many key vendors finance portions of the cost of catalog publication and distribution based upon the amount of coverage given in the catalogs to their respective products 
a reduction in or discontinuation of this practice could have a material adverse effect on the company 
rapid changes in software products and risk of inventory obsolescence 
the software products industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to identify and obtain the right to market products that will meet the changing requirements of the marketplace 
the company has sought to minimize its inventory exposure through a variety of inventory control procedures and policies  including formal and informal vendor price protection programs 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain greater purchasing discounts  the company expects to carry increased inventory levels of certain products in the future 
in addition  large software firms continue to develop products that include the features of utility and subroutine products published and or sold by the company in their software languages  thus rendering certain of such products unnecessary 
additionally  if the growth rate of the personal computer market were to decrease  with a corresponding decrease in demand for computer software  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and offer products necessary to remain competitive or avoid losses related to obsolete inventory  or that unexpected new product introductions will not have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s inventory 
stock volatility 
the technology sector of the united states stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods 
numerous conditions  which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the company in particular  whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the company s operating performance  could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements regarding litigation  the loss of a significant vendor  increased competition  reduced vendor incentives and trade credit  higher postage and operating expenses  and other developments  could have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions strategy 
the company plans to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions will be available to the company on acceptable terms  that financing for future acquisitions will be available on acceptable terms  that future acquisitions will be advantageous to the company or that anticipated benefits of such acquisitions will be realized 
the pursuit  timing and integration of possible future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results 
state sales tax collection 
the company presently collects state sales tax  or other similar tax  only on sales of products to residents of the state of new jersey 
various states have tried to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sale of products shipped to state residents 
the united states supreme court has affirmed its position that it is unlawful for a state to impose state sales tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and subsequent delivery of purchased goods by parcel post and interstate common carriers 
however  it is possible that legislation may be passed to overturn such decision or the supreme court may change its position 
additionally  it is currently uncertain as to whether electronic commerce  which will likely include the company s internet sales activities  will be subject to state sales tax 
the imposition of new state sales tax collection obligations on the company in states to which it ships products would result in additional administrative expenses to the company and could result in price increases to the customer  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
