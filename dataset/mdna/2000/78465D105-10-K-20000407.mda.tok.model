year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in major system failure or miscalculations 
we rely on numerous computer systems for day to day operations and may be adversely affected by the year situation 
our costs in connection with year remediation and preparations totaled approximately million  with substantially all of such costs occurring in substantially all of our clients are similarly dependent on computer systems and they also may be adversely affected by the year situation

we continue to believe that the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for our business and operations on a going forward basis

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this hypothetical amount based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements and the company s actual debt balances
