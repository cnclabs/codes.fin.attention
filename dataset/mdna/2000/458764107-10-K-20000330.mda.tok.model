item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenue base consists of payments from instant ticket vending machine itvm and phone card dispensing machine pcdm leases sales of itvms and pcdms  and to a lesser extent  sales of parts for itvms and pcdms and service agreements 
the company emphasizes leasing rather than selling itvms to lotteries when possible 
leases provide the company with a consistent revenue stream  opportunities to generate income on financing  and the potential to deploy a greater number of itvms within a lottery s budget due to the lower initial cash outlay required by the lottery 
leasing itvms also gives the lotteries the flexibility to enhance their itvms in the future with new technology from the company 
on the other hand  leasing itvms requires the company to invest capital or otherwise finance the manufacture of itvms  whereas sales of itvms result in the receipt of payment in full upon delivery of the itvms 
when the company sells itvms  the company generally is able to manufacture and deliver the itvms and receive full payment for them before it must pay for the materials used to manufacture the itvms 
nevertheless  the company believes that the advantages of leasing itvms  as described above  justify the initial capital investment or financing costs required to manufacture itvms for lease 
for similar reasons  the company emphasizes leasing rather than selling pcdms to providers of prepaid telephone cards 
as with itvms  the company believes that the benefits to the company of leasing pcdms warrant the initial capital investment required to manufacture pcdms 
however  the great majority of the pcdms deployed to date have been sold rather than leased 
the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its financial results due to its dependence upon a small number of major customers  the unpredictable nature  timing and results of the lotteries contract bid and award process 
the company s revenues and capital expenditures can vary significantly from period to period because the company s sales cycle may be relatively long and because the amount and timing of revenues and capital expenditures depend on factors such as the amount and timing of awarded contracts and changes in customer budgets and demands 
operating results may be affected by the lead time sometimes required for business opportunities to result in signed lease or sales agreements  working capital requirements associated with manufacturing itvms pursuant to new orders  increased competition and the extended time that may elapse between the award of a contract and the receipt of revenues from the sale or lease of itvms 
as compared to total revenues decreased by  from  to  in  or  due primarily to a  decrease in machine sales and a  increase in lease revenues accompanied by a  increase in other revenues 
revenues from leases increased by from  in to  in  resulting from a new lease in one state  the continuation of leases in seven states and the renewal of eight leases in other states that had reached the conclusion of their original terms 
revenues from sales decreased by from  in to  in  as a result of a decrease in itvms and pcdms sold in over the total number of itvms and pcdms under lease increased in as a result of deployment of new units  partially offset by the retirement of older units 
lease revenues were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from sales of itvms and pcdms were and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in lease revenues and decrease in sales revenues reflects the cumulative effect of continuing revenues from machines under lease which were deployed prior to and the incremental revenue of new machines leased or deployed in other revenues increased by from  in to  in  as machines deployed prior to generated service revenue for the entire year 
cost of revenues for machine sales and other decreased from  in to  in this decrease reflects the decrease in the number of machines sold in cost of revenues for leased itvms and pcdms  excluding depreciation  increased from  in to  in the increase in cost of lease revenues was the result of higher personnel and subcontractor costs related to the larger number of machines deployed during depreciation of itvms and pcdms increased by from  in to  in the increase was greater than the related increase in number of leased itvms and pcdms  as newer units have more capacity and cost more

as a result of the above factors  the company s net income before extraordinary items increased by from  in to  in the extraordinary item of  net of tax  relates to a gain on the involuntary conversion of assets lost in a tornado which were covered by insurance at replacement cost 
as compared to total revenues increased by  from  to  in  or  due primarily to a  increase in machine sales and a  increase in lease revenues accompanied by a  increase in other revenues 
revenues from leases increased by from  in to  in  resulting from the continuation of leases in nine states and the renewal of seven leases in other states that had reached the conclusion of their original terms 
other revenues increased by from  in to  in  as machines deployed prior to generated service revenue for the entire year and service for itvms in one state was taken over from a sub contractor 
revenues from sales increased by from  in to  in  as a result of an increase in itvms and pcdms sold in over the units sold in included a greater number of higher priced machines than the total number of itvms and pcdms under lease increased in as a result of deployment of new units  partially offset by the retirement of older units 
lease revenues were and of total revenues for and  respectively

the company maintains its philosophy of using contractors as the primary source of research and development efforts  allowing the company to focus its expenditures on the technical expertise necessary to accomplish the specific project 
operating income increased by from  in to  in this increase resulted from the continuing benefit of revenues derived from machines deployed in prior periods  including machines which had been fully depreciated  combined with ongoing machine sales and leases 
interest expense increased by from  in to  in the increase reflects the cost of additional borrowings to finance leased equipment built and deployed in  partially offset by lower interest rates resulting from utilization of the libor option in our loan agreement 
income taxes increased by from  in to  in as a result of an increase in income before taxes of

leasing generally offers the company better gross margins than direct sales agreements 
however  leasing inherently requires more capital and a longer term payout than sales 
as of december   the company had a total of  itvms and pcdms under operating and sales type leases 
at december  and  the company had working capital deficits of  and  respectively 
these deficits reflect the classification of the company s revolving credit facility as a current debt due to the revolver clause of the facility 
at december   the company was indebted to mercantile business credit  inc mbc in the aggregate principal amount of  pursuant to a revolving credit agreement entered into as of october  the facility permits the company to borrow through october  with two one year extensions to october  up to  at the prime interest rate or the respective libor rate plus two percent 
borrowings under this facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the company and assignment of proceeds from lease agreements 
at december   the company had  available under this agreement 
at december   the company also was indebted to two stockholders in the aggregate principal amount of  incurred to finance the manufacture of itvms 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company s capital expenditures totaled  and  for and  respectively 
these amounts include  and  for the manufacture of machines leased during the respective periods 
other expenditures represent machinery and equipment costs for expanded office capacity 
the company had no material commitments for additional capital expenditures as of december  other than for the manufacture of itvms and pcdms for future lease 
at december   the company had estimated tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the use of these carryforwards is subject to certain annual limitations due to ownership changes in special note regarding forward looking statements the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions used in this report are intended to identify forward looking statements  although this report also contains other forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements in this report are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation act of investors are cautioned that actual results may differ substantially from such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  continued acceptance of the company s products and services in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  dependence upon third party vendors  a limited number of customers  political and other uncertainties related to customer purchases and other risks detailed in the company s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following risk factors apply to interlott and its business we may experience fluctuations in our financial results and  as a result  our stock price 
in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our financial results 
our revenues  capital expenditures and operating results can vary significantly due to o our dependence on a small number of major customers  o relatively long sales cycles  o the unpredictable timing and amount of contracts awarded by state lotteries and telephone companies  o the extended time between the award of a contract and the receipt of revenues from the sale or lease of itvms and pcdms  o changes in customer budgets  and o working capital required to manufacture itvms and pcdms pursuant to new orders 
these factors may make it difficult to forecast revenues and expenditures over extended periods 
consequently  our operating results for any period could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this in turn could lead to sudden and sometimes dramatic declines in the market price of our stock 
our growth will depend upon continued market acceptance of itvms and pcdms 
our ability to generate additional revenues and earnings will depend upon the continuation of existing leases of itvms and pcdms  the distribution of itvms and pcdms in additional states and international jurisdictions  the approval of lotteries in remaining states and international jurisdictions and increased future orders of itvms and pcdms 
as of december   states  the district of columbia and eight international jurisdictions used itvms as part of their instant ticket distribution system 
we leased or sold itvms in of those states  the district of columbia and in eight international jurisdictions 
similarly  the use of pcdms to distribute prepaid telephone calling cards has grown significantly in the last few years 
we have marketed pcdms since  and as of december   we had sold or leased pcdms 
however  the popularity of instant lottery games and prepaid telephone calling cards and the demand for itvms and pcdms may not continue and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully market and sell our products 
although the total dollar amount of instant ticket sales continues to increase  the rate of increase has declined from to 
for the lottery industry s fiscal year ended june  through june  it is important but not critical that we develop relationships with additional lotteries and telephone companies and that additional states authorize instant lotteries 
we depend on large contracts from a limited number of itvm customers 
we have traditionally derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of state lottery authorities or their representatives for the lease  sale or service of itvms 
in particular  during  a contract with the ohio lottery accounted for of our total revenues and of our lease revenue 
additionally  a contract with the new york lottery accounted for of our machine sales revenues and of our total revenue in  this can cause our revenues and earnings to fluctuate between quarters based on the timing of orders and realization of revenues from these orders 
further  none of our large customers has any obligation to lease or purchase additional machines from us 
a loss of any of these large contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our proprietary rights or avoiding claims that we infringe the proprietary rights of others 
we principally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  license agreements and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights and technology 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
our success depends largely on our burster technology that is protected by a patent that expires on december  additionally  we have four other patents and one pending patent application with the united states patent and trademark office 
we also have an exclusive license agreement with algonquin industries  inc for use of their patented pull tab instant ticket dispensing mechanism in our ptvm and pcdm 
we cannot be certain that we and algonquin have taken adequate steps to prevent misappropriation of the technology that we use or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in the defense of any claims relating to the proprietary rights of others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to adapt to changes in technology  products and industry standards 
the instant ticket market  the itvm market  the prepaid telephone calling card market and the pcdm market are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry practices 
competitors may introduce other types of lottery  gaming and prepaid telephone calling card products 
to be successful  we must o use leading technologies effectively  o continue developing our technical expertise  o enhance our existing products and services  and o develop new products and services 
if we fail to do any of these things  our customers may choose to purchase products and services from our competitors 
our inability to anticipate changes in technology and industry practices and to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the state lotteries can cancel their contracts with us for any reason and can assess significant damages against us if we do not satisfactorily perform the contracts 
our contracts with lotteries  like most other types of state contracts  typically permit a lottery to terminate the contract upon days written notice for any reason 
we may not be able to re lease or sell any itvms that are returned to us by a lottery following the cancellation or expiration of a lease 
these lottery contracts also impose demanding installation  performance and maintenance requirements 
our failure to perform the contract requirements could result in significant liquidated damages or contract termination 
our lottery contracts typically require us to indemnify the lottery  its officers and retailers for any liabilities arising from the operation of the itvms or any services that we provide 
these provisions present an ongoing risk of significant damage assessments or contract terminations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a single stockholder controls a majority of our stock and can exert significant influence over our corporate matters 
as of december   mr 
l 
roger wells  jr 
beneficially owned of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
wells can control the election of directors and the outcome of certain corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership in a single stockholder also can delay or prevent a change of control 
our itvm lease contracts may result in losses 
our itvm lease revenues as a percentage of our total revenues were in  in and in our standard lease agreements provide for fixed lease payments during the term of the agreement and some permit the lottery to order additional itvms at any time during the lease term 
if one of these lotteries were to order a large number of itvms near the end of the lease term  we would incur significant manufacturing costs but might receive lease payments for only a relatively short period of time through the remainder of the lease term 
additionally  we are unable to pass along to the lottery any increases in manufacturing and service costs during the term of the lease agreement 
our standard lease agreements provide for a short initial term  such as one year  with an option for the lottery to extend the lease term for additional one year periods 
if the lottery does not extend the initial lease term  we might incur a loss on the manufacture of the itvms if we are unable to re lease or sell the itvm 
the itvm and pcdm markets are very competitive 
the itvm and pcdm markets are markets that have grown rapidly in recent years 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  some of whom may have greater resources and experience than us 
the instant ticket market also may face competition from other types of lottery and gaming products  particularly on line lottery products 
the long distance telephone market similarly may face competition from other types of communications products  including facsimile  e mail and other on line products 
if the ability to provide itvms and pcdms internationally becomes a competitive advantage in the instant ticket lottery and prepaid calling card industries  we will have to expand our presence internationally or risk a disadvantage relative to our competitors 
increased competition could cause us to increase our selling and marketing expenses and research and development costs 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any such increased costs through an increase in the number of lottery contracts and higher revenue from sales and leases of itvms and pcdms  and we may not have the resources to compete successfully 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
because we depend upon single or limited source suppliers  we could temporarily lose our supply of some critical parts or experience significant price increases 
we currently purchase certain important parts  such as components of our itvm burster  ptvm dispensing mechanism and pcdm dispensing mechanism  from a single source 
the purchase of these components from outside suppliers on a sole source basis subjects us to certain risks  including the continued availability of suppliers  price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
because other suppliers exist that can duplicate these components should we elect or be forced to use a different supplier  we do not believe that a change in suppliers would result in the termination of a production contract 
however  we could experience a delay of to days in the production of itvms and pcdms should we elect or be forced to use other suppliers 
any delay of to days could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we may not be able to retain our key executives and engineering and marketing personnel 
as a small company with only employees  our success depends in large part on the continued service of our key management  sales  product development and operational personnel  including mr 
l 
rogers wells  jr  our chairman  and david f 
nichols  our president and chief executive officer 
we do not currently have employment agreements with any of our employees 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with a variety of skills  especially engineering and marketing expertise 
our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel would likely have a material adverse effect on our current business  any new product development efforts and future business prospects 
the success of our international operations is subject to many uncertainties 
in each of and  our sales and leases of itvms and pcdms outside the united states represented an immaterial percentage of our total revenues 
however  we are increasing our marketing activities in international jurisdictions  including expansion into several countries 
our ability to expand our business into international markets may be adversely affected by the following o customizing our products for use in international countries  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles  o difficulties in managing international operations  o availability of trained personnel to install and implement our systems  o exchange rate fluctuations  o political instability  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o potentially adverse tax obligations  o restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  o the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws and regulations  and o the risk that our intellectual property rights will not be protected to as great an extent as in the united states 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international revenues and earnings and our overall financial performance 
our industry is subject to significant government regulation which could negatively affect us 
state and local governments strictly regulate the operation of lotteries and the sales and leasing of itvms 
further  international jurisdictions that operate lotteries impose strict regulations which may vary from those in the united states 
any adverse change in the lottery laws of any jurisdiction in which we sell and lease itvms could impose burdensome requirements or requirements that we may be unable to satisfy 
our failure to comply with changing lottery related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  state laws provide for background investigations on each of the lottery s vendors and their affiliates  subcontractors  officers  directors  employees and principal stockholders 
the failure of any of these parties associated with us to obtain or retain approval in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of large numbers of shares in the market  or the perception that such sales could occur 
this is particularly true due to our relatively small number of stockholders and the resulting low trading volume of our common stock in the public market 
all outstanding shares of our common stock either are freely tradeable without restriction or may be sold in accordance with the volume limitations of rule of the securities act of these factors also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings 
our principal stockholder  mr 
l 
rogers wells  jr  owns a majority of our common stock
