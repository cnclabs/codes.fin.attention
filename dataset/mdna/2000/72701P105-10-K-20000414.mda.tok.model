year compliance introduction the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the problems created by using abbreviated dates appear in hardware such as microchips  operating systems  and other software programs 
we implemented our year yk compliance project to prepare our business for the year we define yk compliance to mean that the computer code will process all defined future dates properly and give accurate results 
plan to address year compliance we conducted a review of our computer systems and capabilities and created a three pronged program for addressing issues related to the yk 
this program includes the purchase and implementation of software packages from vendors  an upgrade of vendor packages to yk compliant versions  and the internal development and implementation of new software applications to increase the capabilities of our systems for the future 
we began implementing this plan in with an upgrade of the mainframe operating system 
we purchased and replaced our accounting and financial system and workers compensation system and wrote and implemented a new system for the unemployment compensation business 
we received from the vendor and implemented  for all current accounts  the latest version of its claims processing software  which is yk compliant 
we also upgraded our billing and administrative system to be yk compliant 
we requested yk compliance information from our significant customers and vendors  including landlords and other third parties that are responsible for non information technology systems such as security and environmental controls 
in particular  we asked each vendor and customer for information regarding a the status of the vendor s or customer s yk readiness initiative  and b information regarding any expected changes in the vendor s or customer s data interface with us 
a team of our information system professionals coordinated our yk compliance efforts and tested any new interfaces with vendors and customers 
to date  we have not experienced disruptions in any of our computer systems 
our team of information system professionals will continue to monitor our computer systems until we have completed data exchanges with vendors and customers 
although we do not expect that any disruptions that might occur from such data exchanges would materially disrupt our computer systems  we cannot guarantee that they would have no material effect 
cost of project between january  and december   we spent million for yk compliance systems and upgrades 
these costs include the expense of replacing any existing systems with yk compliant systems  even in cases where the system would have been replaced or upgraded regardless of yk requirements 
we expect to spend less than million during the first quarter of in both capital and modification costs to complete our yk program

the amendment and waiver also reduced the amount available under the line of credit from million to million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and  in some cases  relate to our acquisitions of related businesses 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing line of credit and any future financing requirements 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our notes issued to c g insurance services  inc  the former owner of centra  and certain equipment notes  and our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our line of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations in thousands and weighted average interest rates associated with our existing long term debt instruments  assuming our actual level of long term indebtedness of million as of december  thereafter liabilities long term debt fixed rate weighted average interest rate of 





 variable rate weighted average interest rate of 








  our primary market risk exposure relates to i the interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  ii the impact of interest rate movements on its ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants  and iii the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on our variable rate debt by using two separate interest rate swap agreements 
the agreements  which expire in september and december  effectively convert million of variable rate debt under the line of credit to fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of a increase in interest rates due to increased rates nationwide would result in additional interest of approximately million net of interest saved on our interest rate swap agreements 
while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  our management continues to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
