the prison realty merger was accounted for as a purchase acquisition of old prison realty 
subsequent to the prison realty merger  the company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a reit and acquires  develops and leases properties rather than operating and managing prison facilities 
cca is a private prison management company that operates and manages the substantial majority of facilities owned by the company 
as a result of the merger and certain contractual relationships existing between the company and cca  the company is dependent on its significant sources of income from cca 
in addition  the company pays cca for services rendered to the company in development of its correctional and detention facilities 
as of december   cca leased of the operating facilities owned by the company 
for a complete description of the contractual arrangements between the company and cca  see business general development of business and recent developments 
as the lessor of correctional and detention facilities  the company is currently dependent upon the ability of its tenants to make lease payments to the company 
cca is currently the lessee of a substantial majority of the company s facilities 
therefore  the company is currently dependent for a substantial portion of its revenues on cca s ability to make the lease payments required under the cca leases for such facilities 
as previously discussed herein  cca has incurred substantial losses from operations through the fourth quarter of in an effort to address cca s liquidity  the company and cca intend to amend the terms of the cca leases as described herein under the heading recent developments transactions between the company and cca to restructure the payments due the company under the cca leases 
cca s obligation to make payments under the cca leases is not secured by any of the assets of cca  although the obligations under the cca leases are cross defaulted so that the company could terminate all of the leases if cca fails to make required lease payments 
under such circumstances  the company would be required to find a suitable lessee for the company s facilities in order to generate revenue and to maintain its ability to qualify as a reit 
due to the unique nature of correctional and detention facilities  the company may be unable to locate suitable lessees or to attract such lessees 
results of operations the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of million and has been in default under its bank credit facility outstanding balance of million at december  and is in default the mdp notes outstanding balance of million at december  
in addition  the company expects to be in default under the bank credit facility  the mdp notes and its million convertible  subordinated notes during the defaults relate to failure to comply with certain financial covenants and a change in control provision  as defined in the agreements 
the noncompliance with the requirements under these outstanding obligations could result in the creditors demanding immediate repayment of these obligations 
the events of default have not been formally declared and no acceleration actions have been taken by the creditors 
however  the company has acknowledged to the senior lenders under its bank credit facility that an event of default exists under the bank credit facility and  as such  the company has been paying interest at the default rate thereunder since january  the company has not obtained waivers of all noncompliance issues 
in addition  as discussed herein under liquidity and capital resources and in business recent developments shareholder litigation  the company has significant outstanding shareholder and other litigation matters 
for a fuller description of the company s non compliance with the terms and covenants of its indebtedness and events of default thereunder  as well as the company s actions with respect to obtaining waivers of these matters  see business recent developments solicitation of consents for waivers of  and amendments to  provisions of the company s and cca s outstanding indebtedness 
further  cca  the company s primary lessee  which the company is dependent on for its major sources of income  incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   has a net working capital deficiency and a net capital deficiency at december   and is in default under its revolving credit facility 
cca s default under its revolving credit facility relates to failure to comply with certain financial covenants 
in addition  cca is in default under the cca note and has not made certain scheduled lease payments to the company pursuant to the terms of the cca leases 
the company has not provided cca with a notice of nonpayment of lease payments due under the cca leases and thus cca is not currently in default under the terms of the cca leases 
as of december   the first scheduled payment of interest  totaling approximately million  on the cca note was unpaid 
pursuant to the terms of the cca note  cca was required to make the payment on december   however  pursuant to the terms of a subordination agreement  dated as of march   by and between the company and the agent of cca s revolving credit facility  cca is prohibited from making the scheduled interest payments on the cca note when cca is not in compliance with certain financial covenants 
cca is not in compliance with these financial covenants and  consequently  is prohibited from making the scheduled interest payments to the company

as of december   approximately million of rents due from cca to the company were unpaid 
the terms of the cca leases provide that rental payments were due and payable on december  during  cca has paid million of lease payments related to and no lease payments relating to also  the independent public accountants of cca have indicated in their opinion on the respective consolidated financial statements that there is substantial doubt about cca s ability to continue as a going concern 
continued operating losses by cca  declarations of events of default and acceleration actions by the company s and cca s creditors  the continued inability of cca to make contractual payments to the company  and the company s limited resources currently available to meet its operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  these matters concerning the company and cca raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of asset carrying amounts or the amounts of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company has limited resources currently available to meet its operating  capital and debt service requirements 
as a result  the company currently is  and will continue to be  dependent on its ability to borrow funds under the terms of its credit facility to meet these requirements 
due to the company s financial condition and non compliance with certain covenants under the terms of its credit facility  the availability of borrowings under its credit facility is uncertain 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet its operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements in the future

the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper on funds from operations the white paper approved by the board of governors of nareit in  which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
further  funds from operations does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the company s funds from operations for the year ended december  in thousands net income available to common shareholders  plus real estate depreciation  add back non recurring items change in tax status  write off of loan costs  loss on disposal of assets  write off of amounts under lease arrangements  impairment loss  funds from operations  inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct adverse effect on its operations 
the cca leases generally contain provisions which will mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling the company to pass through to cca certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
additionally  the cca leases contain provisions which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its bank credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the bank credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
if the interest rate for the company s outstanding indebtedness under the bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower in  the company s interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of its senior notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible  subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible  subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of and million of preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of 
similarly  as of  the company had a note receivable in the amount of million with a fixed interest rate of 
because the interest and dividend rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the company 
the bank credit facility required the company to hedge million of its floating rate debt on or before august  the company has entered into certain swap arrangements guaranteeing that it will not pay an index rate greater than on outstanding balances of at least a million through december  and b million through december  there is no balance sheet effect related to this arrangements  and the monthly income effect of these arrangements is recognized in interest expense 
despite the change in market interest rates  the company will pay the fixed rate as set on the required balance 
additionally  the company may  from time to time  invest its cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and months 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these investments 
the company also uses  or intends to use  long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments  if issued  will typically bear fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company may occasionally enter into interest rate protection agreements similar to the interest rate swap arrangement described above 
the company does not believe it has any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
the company does not have a material exposure to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations related to its operations 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its operations or investment portfolio
