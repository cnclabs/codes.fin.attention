item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k may contain certain projections  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed above at item business risk and uncertainties and item business risk and uncertainties forward looking statements 
while this outlook represents management s current judgment on the future direction of the business  such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof 
overview triangle is engaged in the development of new drug candidates primarily for serious viral diseases 
since our inception on july   our operating activities have related primarily to recruiting personnel  negotiating license and option arrangements for our drug candidates  raising capital and developing our drug candidates 
we have not received any revenues from the sale of products and do not expect any of our drug candidates to be commercially available until at least the year as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we require substantial capital expenditures relating to the development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates  including expenditures for preclinical testing  chemical synthetic scale up  manufacture of drug substance for clinical trials and toxicology studies  clinical trials of drug candidates  sales and marketing expenses and payments to our licensors 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years  due substantially to the expansion of our drug development programs and the addition of infrastructure necessary to commercialize our drug candidates 
we will require substantial capital expenditures relating to activities many of which may need to occur prior to  and in anticipation of  the potential regulatory approval of our drug candidates  including expenditures associated with the continued establishment of a sales and marketing organization  the manufacture of drug substance  the development of a distribution system with outside vendors and other administrative expenditures 
many of these capital expenditures may be incurred irrespective of whether our drug candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
see item business risk and uncertainties we have incurred losses since inception and may never achieve profitability 
we have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of triangle and our prospects can be based 
the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development must be considered when evaluating our prospects 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  successfully develop and commercialize our drug candidates  secure all necessary proprietary rights  respond to competitive developments  obtain additional financing and continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these risks 
see item business risk and uncertainties all of our products are in development and may never be successfully commercialized which would have an adverse impact on your investment and our business and risk and uncertainties if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  we would have to curtail or cease operations 
our operating expenses will depend on several factors  including the level of development expenses and the potential commercialization of our drug candidates 
development expenses will depend on the progress and results of our drug development efforts  which we cannot predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing and clinical trial activities 
the level of expenses relating to the establishment of a sales and marketing organization  the manufacture of drug substance and other administrative expenditures will depend on the success of the development of our drug candidates  however  many of these capital expenditures may be incurred irrespective of whether our drug candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our consolidated operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
see item business risk and uncertainties the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
results of operations interest income  net net interest income totaled million in  compared to million in  and to million in the increase in interest income in compared to  and in compared to  is due primarily to larger average investment balances primarily from financing proceeds 
larger average investment balances in  as compared to  are associated primarily with proceeds associated with the abbott alliance and with financing activities in december of see liquidity and capital resources 
license fees license fees totaled million in  compared to million in and to  in license fees in relate to achievement of milestone obligations  license fees associated with the license and settlement agreements with glaxo on the use of coviracil to treat hepatitis b  and license preservation fees for our drug candidate portfolio 
license fees in related primarily to execution of the l fmau license agreement as well as license preservation fees for our drug candidate portfolio 
license fees in related mainly to license preservation fees for our drug candidate portfolio 
the increase in as compared to and relates primarily to recognition of milestone obligations required under license agreements of our drug candidate portfolio and other fees 
future license fees may consist of milestone payments or annual preservation payments under existing licensing arrangements  the amount of which could be substantial and the timing of which will depend on a number of factors that we cannot predict 
these factors include  among others  the success of our drug development programs and the extent to which we in license additional drug candidates 
see liquidity and capital resources 
development expenses development expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and to million in development expenses in consisted primarily of expenses for drug synthesis  clinical trials  employee compensation  preclinical testing and consulting expenses 
development expenses in consisted primarily of expenses for drug synthesis  clinical trials  employee compensation  toxicology studies  preclinical testing and patent related activities for our drug candidates 
development expenses in consisted primarily of expenses for drug synthesis  clinical trials  toxicology studies  employee compensation  preclinical testing and patent related activities for our drug candidates 
the substantial increase in development expenses as compared to and is due primarily to the continued and more expansive drug development activities on our drug candidates  including the addition of development personnel necessary to perform these activities 
in and  development expenses were reduced by approximately  and million  respectively  relating to the reimbursement of certain development expenses under our license agreements 
we expect our development expenses to increase in the future due to continued expansion of drug development activities for our existing portfolio of drug candidates  including preclinical testing  toxicology studies  clinical trials and the manufacture of drug substance for preclinical tests  clinical trials and production of commercial material in anticipation of product launch 
in addition  if we in license or otherwise acquire rights to additional drug candidates  development expenses would increase 
purchased research and development purchased research and development expenses totaled million in and million in purchased research and development expense in relates to the april  issuance of  shares of common stock as consideration to former stockholders of avid for extending the payment date of certain contingent consideration from february  to february  the charge  representing the fair market value of our common stock at the date on which the extension was granted  was recorded as purchased research and development as dmp is still at an early stage of clinical development and has no alternative future use 
purchased research and development expense in related to our acquisition of avid in which we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of avid and agreed to issue up to  additional shares of common stock upon the achievement of certain milestones relating to dmp the charge represents avid s in process research and development associated with avid s principal asset  worldwide license rights to dmp in march  the payment date of certain contingent consideration was extended a second time until august  as consideration for the second extension  we agreed to issue  shares of common stock and to increase the remaining number of contingent shares by  accordingly  if we initiate pivotal phase ii clinical trials with dmp on or before august  or elect on or before august  to continue development of dmp even if such clinical trials had not been initiated  we would issue  shares of common stock 
issuance of the  shares will be recorded as additional purchase price in the avid acquisition and will be recorded in based on the fair market value of the common stock 
issuance of the remaining  of the  shares is contingent upon the attainment of other development milestones with dmp issuance of any of these contingent shares will be recorded as additional purchase price and will be allocated upon resolution of the underlying contingency 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in sg a expenses in consisted primarily of amounts paid for outside professional services  primarily marketing  legal and investor relations services  employee compensation and rent expense 
sg a expenses in consisted primarily of employee compensation expense  amounts paid for outside professional services  primarily marketing  legal and investor relations services  and rent expense 
sg a expenses in consisted primarily of employee compensation expense  rent expense and amounts paid for outside professional services 
the increases in compared to and are due primarily to increased sales and marketing expenditures as we develop our sales and marketing infrastructure and from the growth of our operations and personnel to support clinical and development activities 
sg a expenses were reduced by approximately million in for reimbursable sales and marketing expenses as dictated by the abbott alliance profit and loss sharing arrangement 
we expect that our sg a expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand development activities and continue the development of our sales and marketing organization 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception july   primarily with the net proceeds received from private placements of equity securities  which provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million net of offering costs  and from initial and secondary public offerings  which provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million net of offering costs  as well as net proceeds from the completion of the abbott alliance including net proceeds from the sale of common stock and non contingent research and development reimbursement of approximately million 
in addition  we have received approximately million as reimbursement of certain development expenses under our license agreements 
see strategic alliance with abbott laboratories 
during  we completed our strategic alliance with abbott 
in addition to providing global sales  marketing  and manufacturing capabilities  the abbott alliance provided approximately million in net proceeds in from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock  approximately million in net reimbursement of research and development expenses  and approximately million in net reimbursed sales and marketing expenses as dictated by the abbott alliance profit and loss sharing arrangement 
during  we had three equity offerings which provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had net working capital of million  an increase of million over december  the increase in working capital is principally the result of net proceeds and reimbursement from the abbott alliance partially offset by costs of the continued development of our drug candidates and other increased operating costs 
our principal source of liquidity at december   was million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments which are considered available for sale  reflecting a million increase of cash  cash equivalent and investment balances over those at december  in conjunction with the development of our drug candidates  we outsource certain aspects of our clinical trials and focus on what we believe are the most critical aspects of the development process 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual arrangements with selected third parties regarding clinical and toxicology studies in the development of our drug candidates 
at december   we estimate this contractual commitment to be approximately million  however  this estimate is dependent upon the results of the underlying studies as well as certain other variable components 
additionally  we have entered into agreements with selected third parties to provide drug substance to satisfy our drug development requirements and for the potential commercial launch of our drug candidates 
at december   we estimate this drug substance commitment to be approximately million 
the actual obligation underlying these commitments may differ from our estimates due to a number of variable components 
we expect that our capital requirements will continue to increase in future periods as we fund our drug development programs  pay obligations under our license and or option agreements  continue development of our sales and marketing organization  acquire drug substance from third party manufacturers  and incur other sg a expenditures necessary to support our expanding operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our drug development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the costs under the license and or option agreements relating to our drug candidates including the costs of obtaining patent protection for our drug candidates  the timing and the terms of the acquisition of any additional drug candidates  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our drug candidates  administrative and legal expenses  the establishment of internal capacity and third party arrangements for sales and marketing functions  the establishment of third party arrangements for manufacturing  including abbott  and other factors 
amounts payable by us in the future under our existing license agreements are uncertain due to a number of factors  including the progress of our drug development programs  our ability to obtain approval to commercialize any drug candidate and the commercial success of any approved drug 
our existing license agreements  as of december   may require future cash payments of up to million contingent upon the achievement of certain development milestones and up to million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones 
one of our licensors has the option to receive million of such future milestone payments in shares of common stock based on the then current market price in lieu of a cash payment 
as of december   we are also obligated to issue up to an additional  shares of common stock upon the achievement of certain development milestones relating to dmp  which was acquired in the acquisition of avid 
additionally  we will pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales of each licensed product incorporating these drug candidates 
most of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments commencing three years after regulatory approval 
depending on our success and timing in obtaining regulatory approval  aggregate annual minimum royalties and annual license preservation fees could range from  if only a single drug candidate is approved for one indication to million if all drug candidates are approved for all indications under our existing license agreements 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated capital requirements through june  but expect that we will be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all 
see item business risk and uncertainties if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  we would have to curtail or cease operations 
foreign currency risk management in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
this exposure primarily relates to the purchase of drug substance and or services from foreign vendors in contracts for which the obligation is denominated in a foreign currency 
we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage these exposures when we consider it practical to do so 
we have established a control environment  which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
these policies include only the hedging of firm commitments and prohibit the holding of derivative instruments for trading purposes 
specific hedging strategies depend on several factors  including the magnitude of the exposure  offset through contract terms  cost and availability of the appropriate instruments  anticipated time horizon  and the variability of the underlying commitment 
we monitor the effectiveness of our hedging structures on an ongoing basis 
at december   we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments 
strategic alliance with abbott laboratories in august  we completed a worldwide strategic alliance with abbott for six antiviral compounds 
pursuant to terms of the abbott alliance  we will collaborate with abbott with respect to the clinical development  registration  distribution and marketing of various proprietary pharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of hiv and hepatitis b virus 
in the united states  triangle and abbott will co promote our four drug candidates currently in active development for hiv and or hepatitis b  coviracil  coactinon  dapd and l fmau  and abbott s two hiv protease inhibitors  norvir r ritonavir and abt  currently in phase iii development 
outside the united states  abbott has exclusive sales and marketing rights to promote our four antiviral compounds and their two hiv compounds 
triangle and abbott will share profits and losses for our four drug candidates 
we will receive detailing fees and commissions on incremental sales we generate for abbott s protease inhibitors 
in addition  abbott will have the right of first discussion to market future triangle compounds 
the abbott alliance provides for non contingent research and development reimbursement of million  million of which was received on december  and million was received on january   and up to million of contingent development milestone payments and the sharing of future commercialization costs 
in addition  abbott purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at per share 
the abbott alliance provides us with access to abbott s international and domestic infrastructure to market and distribute products receiving regulatory approval  global manufacturing capabilities  drug development assistance  united states co promotion rights to two abbott compounds  as well as financial support to help fund the continued development of our portfolio of drug candidates 
stockholder rights plan on january   our board adopted a stockholder rights plan in which preferred stock purchase rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right per share of common stock and ten rights per share of series a preferred stock ie  the equivalent of one right per share of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock  held as of february  each right entitles the holder to acquire one thousandth of a share of par value series b junior participating preferred stock  upon a third party acquiring beneficial ownership of percent or more of triangle s common stock  at a price of per right 
the stockholder rights plan is designed to deter a party from gaining control of triangle without offering a fair price to all stockholders and should encourage a party to negotiate with our board prior to attempting to acquire us 
litigation and other contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are indirectly involved in several patent opposition and adversarial proceedings and one lawsuit filed in australia regarding the patent rights related to two of our licensed drug candidates  including coviracil 
although we are not a named party in any of these proceedings  we are obligated to reimburse our licensors for certain legal expenses associated with these proceedings 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
we believe that an adverse judgment rendered against us would not result in a material financial obligation  nor would we have to recognize an impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of as no amounts have been capitalized related to our drug candidates 
however  any development in these proceedings adverse to our interests  including but not limited to any adverse development related to the patent rights licensed to us for these two drug candidates or our rights or obligations related thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business and future consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
see item business risk and uncertainties if we or our licensors are not able to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for our products  we may be unable to commercialize our products or to prevent other companies from using our technology in competitive products 
year compliance we suffered no disruption of operations or adverse events in regards to the year date recognition problem on our existing internal systems  and to our knowledge  there have been no adverse events experienced by our key business vendors which have impacted our operations or will impact our future plans 
total incremental expenditures associated with our year compliance program were approximately  and were expensed as incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended and deferred by sfas  is effective for financial statements for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we intend to adopt sfas when required  however  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we adopted the provisions of sab in the three month period ending december  as it significantly impacts revenue recognition associated with certain terms of our strategic alliance with abbott 
issuance of sab changes revenue recognition practices for non refundable up front payments such as the million non contingent research and development reimbursement stipulated in the abbott alliance and requires deferred recognition of these payments over the anticipated research and development arrangement period 
accordingly  no revenue was recognized in associated with the million reimbursement received on december  revenue recognition for the million non contingent research and development reimbursement will be deferred over the expected development period for the drug candidates in the abbott alliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments 
we have  however  established policies and procedures for market risk assessment and the approval  reporting  and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity triangle is subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality government and corporate bonds with an average maturity of less than one year 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio is expected to decline by an immaterial aggregate amount primarily due to the short maturity of the portfolio 
at december   our portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect our consolidated operating results or cash flows to be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our transactions occur in us dollars and we do not have subsidiaries or investments in foreign countries 
therefore  we are not subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk 
we have  however  established policies and procedures for market risk assessment  including a foreign currency hedging program 
the goal of our hedging program is to economically guarantee  or lock into  exchange rates on firm foreign currency cash outflows and to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our operations 
these policies specifically provide for the hedging of firm commitments and prohibit the holding of derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes
