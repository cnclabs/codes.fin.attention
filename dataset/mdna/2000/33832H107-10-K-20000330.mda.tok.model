year issues flag did not experience any material disruptions in its operations or activities as a result of the year problem 
in addition  flag is not aware that any of their suppliers or customers has experienced any material disruptions in their operations or activities 
flag does not expect to encounter any such problems in the foreseeable future  although we continue to monitor our computer operations for signs of such problems 
it is possible  however  that if year problems are incurred by flag s customers  such problems could have a negative impact on future operations and financial performance  although we have not identified any such problems among our customers or suppliers 
furthermore  the year problem may impact other entities with which flag transacts business and flag cannot predict the effect of the year problem on such entities or resulting effect on flag 
net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities is the single largest component of flag s operating income 
the management of net interest income is of most importance in the banking industry 
flag manages this income source while it controls credit  liquidity  and interest rate risks 
net interest income increased in  from million in to million in net interest income increased in compared to total interest income decreased in and increased in interest expense decreased approximately in and increased in the interest expense variances from year to year have been primarily influenced by the average balances of interest bearing liabilities see tables table consolidated average balances  interest  and rates taxable equivalent basis dollars in thousands years ended december  interest weighted interest weighted interest weighted average income average average income average average income average balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate assets interest earning assets loans       taxable investment securities       tax free investment securities    interest bearing deposits in other banks    federal funds sold

interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities consolidated average balances  interest  and rates net interest income is determined by the amount of interest earning assets compared to interest bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs 
the difference between the weighted average interest rates earned on interest earning assets ie  loans and investment securities and the weighted average interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities ie  deposits and borrowings is called the net interest spread 
another measure of the difference in interest income earned versus interest expense paid is net interest margin 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
table presents for the three years ended december   average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the weighted average interest rates earned and paid on those balances 
in addition  interest rate spreads  net interest margins and the ratio of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities for those years are presented 
average interest earning assets were million in versus million in  and million in average interest bearing liabilities were million in versus million in and million in the interest rate spread was in versus in and in  while the net interest margin was in  in and in table shows the change in net interest income from to and from to due to changes in volumes and rates

  noninterest income other income increased to million in from million in and million in the increases in other income in and resulted from increased gains on the sale of investment securities and increased fee income related to transaction deposit accounts  respectively 
gain on sales of investment securities increased to  in versus  in and  in the increase in gain on sales of investment securities in primarily resulted from gains on the sale of the company s holdings in towne services  inc fees and service charges on deposits decreased to million in from million in and million in noninterest expenses salary and employee benefits increased to million in from million in and million in this increase in was primarily due to additional staffing requirements  the use of temporary employees for special projects and the improvement of our employee benefit package 
the benefits currently offered are  in the opinion of management  necessary to effectively compete in hiring and maintaining a quality staff 
management also believes consolidation efficiencies will continue to be realized and reduce the need for some personnel 
occupancy expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in occupancy expense was the result of a decrease in depreciation on certain fixtures and equipment  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the operations center at eagle s landing 
the increase in occupancy expense in was due to an increase in the number of branch locations 
other expenses were million in versus million in and million in the increase in other operating expenses from to was due to certain merger related expenses  and an increase in data processing expense 
this increase in data processing expense was due to year expenses and certain conversion costs recognized in the increase in other expenses in compared to was due to certain merger related expenses 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity  while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of flag s balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and providing securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
investment securities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  at december   million  approximately of investment securities outstanding  was classified as available for sale  while the remainder was classified as held to maturity 
the overall decrease in the amount of investments was due to sale of investment securities  maturities and paydowns

loans gross loans receivable decreased by approximately million in to million from million at december  this decrease was the result of declines in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  installment loans and lease financing loans  partially offset by an increase in real estate construction and real estate mortgages

an allowance for possible losses is provided through charges to flag s earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in and  in the increase in the provision in compared to was due to provisions made for certain lease financing receivables booked prior to  as well as various commercial and agricultural credits 
these commercial and agricultural credits included provisions for a large residential construction company as well as for certain timber and agricultural loans 
the large increase in the provision for loan losses from to is directly attributable to gulf properties financial  inc gulf properties 
first flag had provided a warehouse line to gulf properties with which gulf properties would originate loans and sell them to first flag 
during  it was discovered that certain loans would not be collectible 
provisions relating to gulf properties totaled  in during  we continued to pursue collection of gulf properties through legal proceedings as well as claims made through our insurance carrier 
management feels that adequate provisions have been made on behalf of gulf properties in view of our collection efforts to date 
management determines the level of the provision for loan losses based on outstanding loan balances  the levels of nonperforming assets  and reviews of assets classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss and larger credits  together with an analysis of historical loss experience  and current economic conditions 
the increased loan loss provision for can also be attributed to management s continued emphasis on improved credit administration  an increase in quality internal loan review and management s conservative approach to loan loss reserve methodology 
historically  the loan portfolio has consisted primarily of loans secured by one to four family residential properties  and actual losses have not been significant 
the banks also provide other services and loan products to meet the growing financial needs of flag s communities  including consumer loans  commercial loans  and commercial real estate loans 
because these loans present a somewhat higher credit risk than loans secured by residential properties  management has significantly increased the allowance for loan losses compared to historic levels to reflect the increased potential for future losses 
as shown in table  the year end allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  the increase in the allowance at december  was due primarily to the increased provisions associated with increased classifications attributed to management s continued focus on asset quality and loan review 
the increase in the allowance for losses in was primarily due to the provision made for gulf properties 
total charge offs were million in  million in  and million in the allowance for loan losses was of net outstanding loans at december   versus of net outstanding loans at december   and of net outstanding loans at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is both adequate and appropriate 
however  the future level of the allowance for loan losses is highly dependent upon loan growth  loan loss experience  and other factors  which cannot be anticipated with a high degree of certainty

as part of the company s renewed credit culture  a special assets division has been established for the purpose of managing all nonperforming assets 
the primary concentration of nonaccrual loans reside with several agri business concerns as well as construction loans attributed to one particular relationship

deposits total deposits decreased approximately million during  totaling million at december  versus million at december  total deposits decreased during from levels of due primarily to management s restructuring of first flag s balance sheet through decreased reliance on larger  volatile certificates of deposit and more emphasis on funding of core deposits 
the maturities of time deposits of  or more issued by the banks at december   are summarized in table table maturities of time deposits over  dollars in thousands three months or less  over three months through six months 
 over six months through twelve months 
 over twelve months  at december   the banks were shareholders in the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlba 
through this affiliation  advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with time deposits of like maturities 
management anticipates continued utilization of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to fund competitive fixed rate loans to customers 
asset liability management a primary objective of flag s asset and liability management program is to control exposure to interest rate risk the exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates so as to enhance its earnings and protect its net worth against potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the average term to maturity or repricing rate changes of assets primarily loans and investment securities has exceeded the average repricing period of liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings 
table provides information about the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december   that are expected to mature  prepay  or reprice in each of the future time periods shown ie  the interest rate sensitivity 
as presented in this table  at december   the liabilities subject to rate changes within one year exceeded its assets subject to rate changes within one year 
this mismatched condition subjects flag to interest rate risk within the one year period because the assets  due to their generally shorter term to maturity or repricing  are more sensitive to short term interest rate changes than the liabilities 
it is management s belief that the result of this position would be a decrease in net interest income if market interest rates rise and an increase in net interest income if market interest rates decline 
management carefully measures and monitors interest rate sensitivity and believes that its operating strategies offer protection against interest rate risk 
as required by various regulatory authorities  flag s board of directors has established an interest rate risk policy  which sets specific limits on interest rate risk exposure 
adherence to this policy is reviewed quarterly by the board of directors asset liability committee 
management has maintained positive ratios of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of flag to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining flag s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the banks customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that flag can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and use of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as the closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
real estate construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or  of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlba advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent flag s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in flag s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the major sources of cash provided by operating activities are net income and the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale 
net cash provided by investing activities of million was funded largely by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and cash acquired in a branch acquisition  net of the premium paid 
net cash used by financing activities consisted primarily of a million net decrease in deposits and a net decrease in fhlba advances of million 
in the opinion of management  flag s liquidity position at december   is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in the consolidated financial statements for the three year analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating  investing and financing activities 
capital resources and dividends stockholders equity at december   decreased from december  this decline resulted from the increase in unrealized losses on securities available for sale

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia required federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with regard to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of fdicia  the federal banking agencies introduced an additional capital measure called the tier risk based capital ratio 
the tier ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk adjusted total assets

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the liquidity and maturity structures of flag s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are influenced by changes in market interest rates 
the company actively manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through policies established by its asset liability management committee the alco 
the alco meets regularly and is responsible for approving asset liability management policies  developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and net interest income and assessing the interest rate sensitivity of the banks 
the company utilizes an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the market value of its investment portfolio
