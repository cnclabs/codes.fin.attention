item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes forward looking statements  including but not limited to statements with respect to the future financial performance  operating results  plans and objectives of mission west properties  inc 
actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending upon a variety of factors  including those described in part i item business risk factors 
overview in may  we  the berg group members  john kontrabecki  and certain other persons entered into the acquisition agreement providing  among other things  for our acquisition of interests as the sole general partner in the operating partnerships 
at the time  the operating partnerships held approximately million rentable square feet of r d property located in silicon valley 
the agreement also provided for the parties to enter into the pending projects acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement and the exchange rights agreement  following stockholder approval 
effective july   we consummated our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships 
we effected our purchase of the general partnership interests by issuing to each of the operating partnerships a demand note bearing interest at per annum  aggregating million of principal payable no later than july  the demand notes 
effective july   all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  op units  representing ownership of approximately of the operating partnerships  upon consummation of the acquisition 
each op unit may be exchanged for one share of common stock pursuant to certain exchange rights and is treated as a share of common stock on a fully diluted basis and also represents our minority ownership interests 
at december   we owned an general partnership interest in the operating partnerships  taken as a whole  on a weighted average basis 
on december   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share to a number of accredited investors to complete our may private placements 
the aggregate proceeds  net of fees and offering costs  of approximately million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the demand notes due to the operating partnerships 
also as of december   we and the limited partners in the operating partnerships entered into the exchange rights agreement  and we entered into the pending projects acquisition agreement and the berg land holdings option agreement with the berg group and other sellers 
in april  we acquired an approximately  square foot five building r d complex  leased to microsoft  on l avenida avenue in mountain view  california by purchasing all of the interests of baccarat shoreline llc  which we have renamed mission west shoreline llc  a wholly owned limited liability company of mission west properties lp in the transaction  we assumed debt totaling approximately million on a consolidated basis  and the former members of baccarat shoreline llc received  op units  of which various members of the berg group received  op units 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs  were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the line of credit with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo line by approximately million and to reimburse microsoft corporation for approximately million for shell and tenant improvements on the microsoft project 
the remaining net proceeds of approximately  were retained for general corporate purposes 
at december   the outstanding balance under the demand notes owed to the operating partnerships was million 
the principal of the demand notes  along with the interest expense  which is interest income to the operating partnerships  is eliminated in consolidation and is not included in the corresponding line items within the consolidated financial statements 
however  the interest income earned by the operating partnerships  which is interest expense to us  in connection with this debt is included in the calculation of minority interest as reported on the consolidated statement of operations  thereby reducing our net income by this same amount 
at present  our only means for repayment of this debt be it in this form or refinanced with another lender  is through distributions received from the operating partnerships in excess of the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders 
we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit for the the taxable year ended december  we have two wholly owned corporate subsidiaries  mit realty  inc and mission west executive aircraft center 
both corporations are inactive 
company history our original predecessor was formed in as palomar mortgage investors  a california business trust 
it operated as a reit  investing primarily in short term and intermediate term construction and development loans secured by first trust deeds on real property 
in  palomar mortgage investors terminated new loan activity and  in  changed its name to mission investment trust 
in  mission investment trust terminated its status as a reit and began to develop and market the properties that it owned 
in  mission west properties was incorporated as a successor to mission investment trust 
in january and may  we sold all of our real estate assets to spieker properties  lp for approximately million in cash 
in february  we paid a special dividend of per share to our stockholders 
after the sale of assets and the payment of the dividend to stockholders  we retained only nominal assets 
the board of directors and management considered available strategic alternatives for the remaining corporate entity  including possible business or asset acquisitions or combinations  a sale of the corporate entity  and outright liquidation 
subsequently  we accepted a proposal by the berg group to acquire control of the corporation as a vehicle to acquire r d properties  or interests in entities owning such properties  from the berg group 
on may   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the berg group  which transferred most of its share purchase rights to unaffiliated accredited investors 
the transaction was completed on september   at which time all of our existing officers and directors resigned and the berg group and the other investors acquired a controlling ownership position as a group 
in july  we acquired control of four existing limited partnerships referred to collectively as the operating partnerships  by becoming the sole general partner in each one effective july  for financial accounting and reporting purposes the acquisition 
we purchased an approximate interest in each of the operating partnerships 
we effected the purchase of our general partnership interests by issuing to the operating partnerships separate demand notes bearing interest at per annum 
the total principal amount of the demand notes issued was  all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  units of limited partnership interest  which represented an ownership interest of approximately of the operating partnerships 
the operating partnerships are the vehicles through which we will own our assets  will make our future acquisitions  and generally conduct our business 
on october   we paid a further distribution of per share to our stockholders from available cash  including approximately  received in the september transaction 
no portion of the distribution was paid on shares acquired by the berg group and its co investors 
in connection with that distribution  the amex halted trading of the common stock on october  neither we nor the amex set a deadline for the resumption of trading  nor did the amex provide guidance beyond declaring its desire that we have a firm commitment to acquire a controlling interest in the r d properties of the berg group and to raise additional capital 
on november   we sent to stockholders a proxy statement prospectus for a meeting on december  to approve or ratify the transactions constituting our upreit acquisition  our sale of common stock under two may private placements  the pending projects acquisition agreement and the berg land holdings option agreement between us and the berg group  and our reincorporation in the state of maryland 
on december   the amex recommenced trading of our common stock 
on december   our stockholders approved and ratified the proposed transactions  and on december   we reincorporated under the laws of the state of maryland through the merger of mission west properties into mission west properties  inc shares of the former company  mission west properties  a california corporation  which were outstanding at december   were converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
results of operations our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships during the third quarter of substantially altered our operations 
as a consequence  operating results for the year ended december  are not meaningfully comparable to our operating results for the same period of  and operating results for the year ended december  are not meaningfully comparable to operating results for the thirteen month period ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  as of december   we owned a general partnership interest of   and in mission west properties  lp  mission west properties  lp i  mission west properties  lp ii and mission west properties  lp iii  respectively  which are the operating partnerships

total expenses for the year ended december   were approximately million  of which approximately related directly to our real estate operations

upon completion of the sale of nine of the properties  we received approximately million in cash  from which we repaid all debt encumbering the properties  thereby eliminating all future interest expense  and paid a majority of the related transaction costs  including million in break up fees from previously terminated sales transactions 
we recognized a net gain of approximately million on the sale 
in addition  we declared and paid a special dividend of per share on february  to stockholders of records on february  and a special cash distribution of per share on october  to stockholders of record on august  accordingly  a comparison of the operating results for that period with the operating results for the year ended december  is not meaningful and has been omitted 
changes in financial condition december  compared with december  during  we acquired five newly constructed r d properties  all located in silicon valley 
these acquisitions added approximately  square feet of rentable space and were acquired from the berg group under the berg land holdings option agreement and the pending projects acquisition agreement 
the total gross acquisition price for these five properties was approximately million 
we financed these acquisitions by the operating partnerships assumption of million of debt due berg berg enterprises  inc the assumption by the operating partnerships of other liabilities of million including the assumption of the sellers obligation to reimburse microsoft corporation for shell and tenant improvements of million and  the issuance of  op units  of which  op units were issued to members of the berg group 
michael anderson  our former vice president  chief operating officer and a director  resigned from the company effective april  we had previously issued  shares of our common stock to mr 
anderson in exchange for a note receivable payable to us for  upon mr 
anderson s resignation  we purchased  of the  shares of common stock  and canceled the related share purchase obligation representing  of the original  note receivable 
we waived interest expense of approximately  due on the portion of the note receivable relating to the canceled shares 
the remaining  of the note receivable was paid in full during the second quarter of in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs  were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the wells fargo line by approximately million and to reimburse microsoft corporation for approximately million for shell and tenant improvements on the microsoft project

during the third quarter of  we entered into a new lease agreement for logic drive with xilinx incorporated xilinx 
the lease agreement includes an option granted to xilinx to purchase the building at a predetermined price 
in september  in accordance with the option provisions of the lease agreement  xilinx paid to us a deposit of approximately million to secure its option right 
xilinx can exercise the option only between april  and july  upon exercise of the option  the company must refund the deposit amount and xilinx must deposit into escrow funds equal to the purchase price of million 
in the event xilinx does not exercise its option  we must refund the deposit in full to xilinx  without interest 
during the year ended december   options were exercised for a total of  shares 
the exercise price for all options exercised was per share and total proceeds to the company were approximately  december  compared with december  as a result of our acquisition of the general partnership interests and control of the operating partnerships  our financial statements consolidate the financial position and results of the operating partnerships  effective as of july  accordingly  through our general partnership interests  as of december   we owned  operated and managed properties representing million rentable square feet 
on september   in our capacity as the general partner of the operating partnerships  we obtained a loan from prudential insurance company of america in the amount of million the prudential loan 
we used the net proceeds of the loan to repay approximately million of mortgage notes payable  and used the remaining amount to reduce the outstanding principal balance owing under the mortgage notes payable to the berg group  which is a related party 
the loan is cross collateralized and secured by a single deed of trust encumbering properties improved with buildings and consisting of approximately million square feet of rentable space  all of which are owned by the operating partnerships 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  matures on october  and is payable in monthly installments of approximately  which includes principal  based upon a year amortization  and interest 
the prudential loan has a substantial prepayment penalty 
the loan is nonrecourse to the operating partnerships and us  except with respect to certain matters such as environmental liability relating to the encumbered properties  the payment of taxes and assessments with respect to the encumbered properties  the responsibility to return security deposits to the tenants of the encumbered properties  insurance or condemnation proceeds that are not properly applied under the terms of the loan  damages that result from early termination or amendment to specified major leases  waste of the subject properties  bankruptcy or insolvency of any of the operating partnerships or us  and any fraud or misrepresentations by us or the operating partnerships in connection with the loan 
in addition  some limited partners have guaranteed portions of the loan 
on september   the operating partnerships assumed a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  n 
a from the berg group 
the line of credit was subsequently reduced to million in october the wells fargo line matured february  and bore interest at the lesser of a the wells fargo prime rate in effect on the first day of each calendar month  b libor plus  or c the wells fargo funds rate quoted on the first day of each calendar month plus 
borrowings outstanding at december  were approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed on the acquisition of two newly constructed r d properties located on richard avenue in santa clara  california and hellyer avenue in san jose  california 
these acquisitions added approximately  square feet of rentable space and were acquired from the berg group under the berg land holdings option agreement and the pending projects acquisition agreement 
the total gross acquisition price for these two properties was approximately million 
through the operating partnerships  we assumed approximately million of debt due berg berg enterprises  inc and issued  lp units of which  were issued to various members of the berg group 
on march   michael j 
anderson  our former vice president and chief operating officer  purchased  shares of common stock at per share in exchange for a  note payable to us and due march  the note was a full recourse promissory note bearing interest at an annual rate of and was collateralized by a pledge of the shares 
additionally  in december  mr 
anderson acquired  shares of our common stock upon partial exercise of his option grant 
the exercise price was per share 
on december   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  to a number of accredited investors in two may private placements 
the aggregate proceeds to us  net of a fee and offering costs  was approximately million 
we used the proceeds to pay outstanding amounts under the demand notes owed to the operating partnerships 
offering costs included  shares of common stock issued for services rendered with the placement of such shares 
following the sale of all of our properties in  coupled with the cash dividends paid to stockholders  only cash and receivables remained and  therefore  the resulting corporate entity had insignificant revenue generating capabilities and cash generating capabilities and minimal operations  aside from interest income and general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our principal source of liquidity for distributions to stockholders  debt service  leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures to be funds from operations ffo  and the borrowings under the line of credit with the berg group 
we expect these sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet projected distributions to stockholders and other presently anticipated liquidity requirements in we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by us 
we expect our ffo to be the principal source of liquidity for distributions  debt service  leasing commissions and recurring capital our million wells fargo line of credit expired on february  and was repaid with proceeds from and replaced by a million line of credit from the berg group 
the wells fargo line of credit was collateralized by of our properties and was guaranteed by mr 
berg and certain other members of the berg group 
the berg group line of credit is currently collateralized by seven properties  bears interest at libor plus percent  and matures in march  we believe that the terms of the berg group line of credit were more favorable than those available from wells fargo or similar lenders 
see item business rish factors our contractual business realationships with the berg group presents additional conflicts of interest which may result in the realization of economic benefits or the defferal of tax liabilities by the berg group without equivolent benefits to our stockholders 
at december   we had total indebtedness of approximately million  including approximately million of fixed rate mortgage debt and approximately million of variable rate mortgage debt due to a related party debt 
of total fixed debt  the prudential secured loan represented approximately million 
during the year ended december   distributions payable to various members of the berg group of approximately million relating to the first  second and third quarters of were converted to related party debt  on terms identical to the wells fargo line of credit 
as of december   our debt to total market capitalization ratio  which is computed as our total debt outstanding divided by the sum of total debt outstanding plus the market value of common stock based on an per share price on a fully diluted basis  including the conversion of all op units into common stock  was approximately based upon an estimated total market capitalization of approximately million

cash used in investing activities during related to improvements made to existing real estate assets  as well as to payments made to microsoft corporation for shell and tenant improvements  which were partially offset by the receipt of million for a refundable option payment 
cash used in investing activities during related solely to improvements made to existing real estate assets acquired as part of our investment in the operating partnerships 
net cash provided by investing activities in related solely to the sales proceeds realized by us on the final disposition of our real estate holdings held prior to net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to and million for the year ended december  and for the thirteen month period ended december   respectively

during  we reduced debt outstanding by utilizing proceeds from new borrowings  issuing  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and utilizing cash provided by operating activities 
during the thirteen month period ended december   we repaid all debt outstanding at that time  and made dividend payments aggregating approximately million 
capital expenditures the properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
for the years ended december  through december   the recurring tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions incurred with respect to new leases and lease renewals of the properties previously owned or controlled by members of the berg group averaged approximately million annually 
we will have approximately  rentable square feet under expiring leases from january  through december  we expect that the average annual cost of recurring tenant improvements and leasing commissions  related to these properties  will be approximately 
million annually from january  through december  we believe we will recover substantially all of these sums from the tenants under the new or renewed leases through increases in rental rates 
until we actually sign the leases  however  we cannot assure you that this will occur 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by the company  but cannot be assumed that we will be able to meet our requirements on favorable terms 
see certain policies 
funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss before minority interest of o 
p unit holders  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt  and make capital expenditures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of profitability nor is it comparable to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of funds available to meet our cash needs  including our need to make cash distributions to satisfy reit requirements 
our definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities  including minority interests that might be exchanged for common stock 
our ffo does not represent the amount available for management s discretionary use  as such funds may be needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
furthermore  ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define ffo exactly as we do 
ffo for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net income loss  add minority interest   depreciation   less gain on sale of securities ffo   overview of distribution policy we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of common stock based on our funds available for distribution fad  which is calculated as ffo less straight lines rents  leasing commissions paid and capital expenditures made during the respective period 
our ability to make such distributions will be affected by numerous factors including  most importantly  the receipt of distributions from the operating partnerships 
fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the actual return that we will realize and the amount available for distributions to stockholders will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenues received from our properties  our operating expenses  the interest expense incurred on borrowings and planned and unanticipated capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash available for distribution will exceed earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes  as the latter figure takes into account non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  that we will incur 
distributions  other than capital gain distributions  by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes most likely will be taxable to us stockholders as ordinary dividend income unless a stockholder is a tax exempt entity 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable reduction of the us stockholder s basis in the common stock to the extent of such basis  and thereafter as taxable gain 
the percentage of such distributions in excess of earnings and profits  if any  may vary from period to period 
distributions will be determined by our board of directors and will depend on actual fad  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of the risk that we will not meet our distribution objectives  see part i item business risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
the calculation of fad for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands ffo   less straight lined rents   leasing commissions capital expenditures fad   policies with respect to certain activities we have adopted policies with respect to investment  financing  conflicts of interest and other activities 
these policies have been formulated by our board of directors  are set forth in our charter  bylaws  operating partnership agreements or agreements with the berg group  and generally may be amended or revised from time to time  subject to applicable agreement terms  at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the stockholders 
among other things  these policies provide that so long as the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  which is calculated based on all outstanding shares of common stock and all shares of common stock that could be acquired upon the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our voting stock  as well as all shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of all op units  the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee as a director  and of the holders of a majority of the op units is required for us to take title to assets  other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the operating partnerships  or to conduct business other than through the operating partnerships  or for us or the operating partnerships to engage in any business other than the ownership  construction  development and operation of real estate properties  or for certain fundamental corporate actions  including amendments to our charter  bylaws or any operating partnership agreement and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the operating partnerships  changes in certain policies with respect to conflicts of interest must be consistent with legal requirements  certain policies with respect to competition by the berg group are imposed pursuant to provisions of the acquisition agreement that cannot be amended or waived without the approval of the independent directors committee of our board of directors  we cannot take any action intended to terminate our qualification as a reit without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors  and we cannot undertake certain other specified transactions  including the issuance of debt securities  and borrowings in excess of specified limits  or the amendment of our charter and bylaws  without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors 
investment policies we expect to pursue our business and investment objectives principally through the direct ownership by the operating partnerships of our properties and future acquired properties 
development or investment activities are not limited to any specified percentage of our assets 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over our equity interests 
while we will emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion and subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification  invest in mortgage and other real estate interests  including securities of other real estate investment trusts 
we have not previously invested in mortgages or securities of other real estate investment trusts  and we do not have any present intention to make such investments 
financing policies to the extent that our board of directors determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financing or retention of cash flow  or through a combination of these sources  after consideration of provisions of the code requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of its taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income 
it is our present intention that any additional borrowings will be made through the operating partnerships  although we may incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnerships 
borrowings may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property  and may have full or limited recourse to all or any portion of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property 
we have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole 
we may also determine to finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of additional op units in the operating partnerships  shares of common stock or other securities 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock or other capital stock  including securities senior to the common stock  in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that we issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for  shares of common stock  subject to limited exceptions  such as the issuance of common stock pursuant to any stock incentive plan adopted by us or pursuant to limited partners exercise of the exchange rights or the put rights  the limited partners will have the right to purchase common stock or such securities in order to maintain their respective percentage interests in us on a fully diluted basis 
if the board of directors determines that we will raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnerships  we will contribute such funds to the operating partnerships as a contribution to capital and purchase of additional general partnership interest  however  holders of op units will have the right to participate in such funding on a pro rata basis 
in the event that holders of op units sell their op units to us upon exercise of their put rights  we are authorized to raise the funds for such purchase by issuing additional shares of common stock 
alternatively  we may issue additional shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered op units 
our board of directors also has the authority to cause the operating partnerships to issue additional op units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration  as it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that the operating partnerships issue new op units for cash  but not property  the limited partners holding op units in an operating partnership will have the right to purchase op units in order  and to the extent necessary  to maintain their respective percentage interests in that operating partnership 
the new op units will be exchangeable for common stock pursuant to the exchange rights or may be tendered to us pursuant to the put rights 
disposition policies we have no current intention of disposing of any of our properties  although we reserve the right to do so 
the tax basis of the limited partners in the properties in the operating partnerships is substantially less than current fair market value 
accordingly  prior to the disposition of their op units  upon a disposition of any of the properties  a disproportionately large share of the gain for federal income tax purposes would be allocated to the limited partners 
for a more detailed discussion of these tax effects  see federal income tax considerations tax aspects of the operating partnerships 
consequently  it may be in the interests of the limited partners that we continue to hold the properties in order to defer such taxable gain 
in light of this tax effect  the operating partnership agreements provide that  until january  or until the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  less than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  which is calculated based on all outstanding shares of common stock and all shares of common stock that could be acquired upon the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our voting stock  as well as all shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of all op units  if earlier  mr 
berg and clyde j 
berg may prohibit the operating partnerships from disposing of properties which they designate in a taxable transaction 
mr

year introduction the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
our efforts to address year issues consisted of reviewing our computer information systems  evaluating other computer systems that do not relate to our internal information systems but include embedded technology at our properties  such as security  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  elevator  fire and safety systems  and communicating with certain significant third party service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect us 
our systems information technology systems 
we have reviewed our information technology systems and have contacted vendors to determine whether such systems are year compliant 
based upon our inquiries  we have determined that our primary network operating system  windows nt server  and all of our desktop personal computers are year compliant 
the vendor for our property management and accounting software has provided us with year compliant software upgrade 
embedded systems 
we believe that  in most cases  under the lease terms it is the tenant s sole responsibility to ensure that the embedded systems  providing  for example  building security  heating  ventilation  air conditioning  fire alarms and sprinklers  and elevator service  are year compliant 
we have made limited inquiries to the vendors for some of the embedded systems used on our properties 
although we have concluded that many of our tenants are responsible for certain year compliance costs  there is a possibility that certain tenants will not agree with such conclusions 
as of march   we were not aware of any systems that are not year compliant 
risks presented by year issues we have not budgeted any amount to address year issues 
at this time  we have not identified any specific business functions that are likely to suffer material disruption as a result of year related events or that will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 
although we believe that our estimates and expectations concerning the scope and cost of year issues that we may confront are based on reasonable assumptions  our actual cost  progress and expenses with respect to our plan to address year issues could differ materially from those set forth in the foregoing forward looking statements
