year the company s year project the project addressed the issue of computer programs with date sensitive software that may be unable to distinguish between the year and the year the company has modified or replaced necessary portions of its software so that its computer systems properly utilize dates beyond december  and mitigate the year issue 
to date the company has incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and efforts in connection with  the project 
at year end  all systems were backed up and verified to be operational prior to the resumption of business after the new year 
the company has not experienced any third party supplier issues 
the company remains alert to potential year related issues that may occur in the future  but believes that there will be no material impact on operations  liquidity or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on its investment portfolio which consists primarily of high quality short term money market funds  commercial paper and corporate bonds with an average maturity of less than one year 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in what it believes are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding average and individual duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   the company s total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments  the majority of which had average maturities within one year 
additionally  the company generally has the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
therefore  the company does not expect its results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s international sales and related royalties of dermabond are based on sales in foreign currencies  but payable in us dollars  and thus may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
