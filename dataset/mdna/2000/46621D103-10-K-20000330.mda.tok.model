item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report 
in particular  for information regarding the company s operations in different industry segments and geographic locations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general jlm is a leading marketer and distributor of certain commodity chemicals  principally acetone and phenol 
the company believes it is the second largest marketer of acetone and the fifth largest marketer of phenol in north america 
jlm is also a global distributor of olefins  principally propylene  as well as a variety of other commodity and specialty chemicals 
in order to provide stable and reliable sources of supply for its products  the company i maintains long established supplier relationships with several major chemical companies  ii manufactures phenol and acetone and iii sources acetone from its joint venture manufacturing operation 
a majority of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of commodity chemicals  prices for which are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
the company endeavors to enter into supply contracts that provide a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
as a result  the company believes that revenues may not be an accurate indicator of the company s overall financial performance 
rather  revenues should be considered along with operating income and net income to accurately measure the company s financial performance 
the company s business consists of manufacturing and marketing segments 
the company s manufacturing segment includes the operations of the blue island plant and the sale of acetone manufactured at the mt 
vernon phenol plant 
the company s marketing segment includes its distribution  storage and terminaling operations and all other sourcing operations 
during the second half of through the year ending  the company felt the hardship of the petrochemical down cycle in which both overall pricing and margins accelerated downward 
pricing pressure on manufactured products  specifically phenol  continued during the year coupled with substantial increases in raw material feedstock costs during the second half 
during the first quarter  major phenol acetone major us producers have announced price increases effective april  in addition  pricing has started firming on the majority of our other products indicating upward movement in the cycle 
set forth below  for the periods indicated  is certain information regarding the contributions by the marketing and manufacturing segments to the company s revenues  gross profit  operating income  gross margin and operating margin 
the marketing segment revenues include an assumed selling commission determined in accordance with industry standards for the sale of products that are manufactured at the blue island plant 
in addition  the marketing segment operating income reflects the expenses associated with the sale of such products 
the marketing segment also includes an assumed allocation of revenues  costs of goods sold and expenses associated with the sale of products sourced from the mt 
vernon plant  which allocation has been determined on a basis consistent with the assumed commission for sale of products manufactured at the blue island plant 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
as a percentage of segment revenues year ended december  gross profit marketing manufacturing total gross profit segment operating income marketing manufacturing total segment operating income year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenues marketing    manufacturing   total revenues    gross profit marketing    manufacturing    total gross profit    segment operating income loss marketing    manufacturing    total segment operating income loss   corporate expense    total operating income loss    marketing segment the marketing segment revenues are influenced largely by the volume of new and existing products sold by the company 
the volume of products sold depends on a number of factors  including growth in the homebuilding and automobile sectors and the overall economic environment 
the company s supply agreements  primarily relating to acetone  frequently contain a term providing for a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
in addition  the company s supplier and customer contracts have a provision permitting the company to purchase or sell additional product at the company s option  typically plus or minus of the contractual volume amount 
as a result  during a period of pricing volatility  the company has the opportunity to improve its profitability by exercising the appropriate option to either build inventory in a rising price environment or to sell product for future delivery in a declining price environment 
in may  the company and its joint venture partners agreed to restructure their investments in otc 
as a result  the company and uds bought out the interest of a third joint venture partner and each became a owner of otc 
the company accounts for its investment in otc through the equity method of accounting 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as part of the restructuring  otc s million of existing indebtedness was refinanced and the take or pay terminaling agreement between otc and the company s olefins marketing operations was cancelled and a new terminaling arrangement was implemented 
under the new arrangement  effective as of january   the company pays terminal throughput fees only when it utilizes the terminaling facility thus generating offsetting revenues 
this restructuring has improved the company s gross profit potential as compared to historical results because the company is no longer required to incur terminal fees without accompanying revenues 
the company s venezuelan operations  which accounted for of total revenues  expose it to the risk of hyperinflation and currency devaluation 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates in translating the net assets of the financial statements in a hyperinflationary economy require any gains or losses to be included in current net income 
during the period through april  exchange controls imposed by the venezuelan government  followed by rapid devaluation  created translation losses that were charged against earnings in each of the respective accounting periods 
in april  exchange controls were lifted and have contributed to the stabilization of the venezuelan currency 
manufacturing segment the results of operations of the company s manufacturing segment are influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  competition and the cost of raw materials  principally propylene and benzene 
the company s ability to pass along raw material price increases to its customers is limited because the commodity nature of the chemicals manufactured at the blue island plant restricts the company s ability to increase prices 
the development of financial instruments to hedge against changes in the prices of propylene and benzene has occurred in the past few years 
the company may seek periodically in the future  to the extent available  to enter into financial hedging contracts for the purchase of propylene and benzene in an effort to manage its raw material purchase costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that the use of such instruments by the company will be successful 
the company can be exposed to losses in connection with such contracts equal to the amount by which the fixed hedge price on the contract is above the market price for such chemicals at the time of purchase 
the company did not enter into any material financial hedging contracts in since its acquisition in  the blue island plant has operated at or near full capacity and  in order to economically expand its production capacity  it would be necessary to increase its capacity to that of a worldscale facility 
however  physical limitations at the blue island plant prohibit such an increase and  as a result  the company has no plans to expand the blue island plant 
since  the company has sourced  on average  approximately million pounds annually of acetone from the mt 
vernon plant 
the company is required to purchase all of the acetone produced at the mt 
vernon plant and not consumed by ge plastics 
it is anticipated that over the next three years the amount of acetone available to jlm from the mt 
vernon plant will be further reduced by approximately to million pounds 
the reduction in the amount of acetone sourced from the mt 
vernon plant is the result of increased consumption by ge plastics 
however  through improved operating efficiencies at the mt 
vernon plant  acetone output has increased thereby partially offsetting ge s internal consumption 
based on this  jlm believes the amount of acetone available for distribution should not be materially affected 
in view of capacity limitations affecting the blue island plant and the anticipated reduction in product sourced from the mt 
vernon plant  the company anticipates any growth in the manufacturing segment will come as a result of additional acquisitions or joint ventures 
tax matters jlm accounts for us income taxes and accrues for us income tax liabilities based on its consolidated us earnings 
for the tax year  the company will file a us federal income tax return reporting approximately million in tax loss which will result in a tax refund of approximately million based on carrying the loss back to prior years in which income taxes were paid 
the company s foreign subsidiaries file tax returns in the country where incorporated 
to the extent these subsidiaries are profitable  taxes are payable based on that country s prevailing tax rate 
upon repatriation of non us earnings  the us allows a foreign tax credit  subject to certain limitations  to be applied against the company s us consolidated return for the foreign taxes paid by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
if losses are incurred  countries in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are incorporated generally allow the losses to be carried forward and applied against income earned in subsequent years 
the company s venezuelan operation has incurred losses which have generated net operating loss carryforwards nols and  based on venezuelan tax regulations  these nols may be carried forward for three years 
in addition  through the acquisition of tolson  the company purchased approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in holland that can be carried forward indefinitely 
during  the holland operation generated approximately million of income on which there will be no income taxes payable either currently or in the future because of the purchased nol carryforwards 
however  the utilization of the acquired tax credits results in deferred tax expense being recognized of approximately  in general  foreign losses are not deductible for us federal income tax purposes and as a result cannot be offset against us pre tax profits 
in an effort to reduce its us federal and state income tax liability  in the company established a foreign sales corporation fsc 
under the internal revenue code  fscs are granted tax incentives for exporting us produced goods overseas  and as such  there are specific tax benefits to the company for the products it exports 
if specific conditions are met under the internal revenue code  up to of the commission income earned by the fsc from these export transactions may be exempted from us taxation 
since the formation of the fsc and prior to  the company had met these requirements  thereby reducing its taxable income 
due to losses incurred by the qualified exporting entities during the tax year  the company derived no benefit from the fsc

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s us transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the company s foreign subsidiaries operate in their local currencies 
the company does  from time to time  purchase short term forward hedge exchange contracts to hedge payments that are in other than the local currency 
the purpose of entering into these short term forward exchange contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of the company s operations 
certain increases or decreases in these payments are then offset by gains and losses on the related short term forward exchange contracts 
the company has in the past entered into fixed financial hedge contracts on certain of its raw materials for use in its manufacturing segment 
during  the company did not enter into any material fixed financial hedge contracts and there were no fixed financial contracts open at december  commodity price risk jlm enters into contracts whereby parties to the contracts agree to exchange various quantities of inventory  primarily acetone  over a specified period of time 
jlm records these exchanges of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as of december   the company had the following related to inventory exchanges total pounds receivable under the exchange contracts  total amount receivable under the exchange contracts  weighted average price per pound payable under the exchange contracts due to the fact that the company is a market maker in acetone  the company normally becomes aware of future price fluctuations in acetone prior to such prices being disclosed on the open market 
therefore  the company believes that it can reposition itself with respect to the inventory exchanges in order to minimize the market risk inherent in such positions 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material adverse effect on its income or its cash flows in fiscal however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change in
