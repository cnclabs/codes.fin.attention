inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes
