references to fiscal  and refer to the fiscal year ended january   january  and january   respectively 
the first retail store operating under the name of diedrich coffee commenced operations in at the conclusion of fiscal  diedrich coffee owned and operated retail locations and had franchised retail locations 
we sell high quality coffee beverages made with our own freshly roasted coffee 
in addition to brewed coffee  we offer a broad range of espresso based beverages such as espresso  cappuccino  cafe latte  cafe mocha and espresso machiato 
to complement beverage sales  we sell light food items and whole bean coffee through our retail locations 
in addition  we have a wholesale division that markets our products directly to independent and chain food service establishments as well as to office coffee systems through brokers and sales representatives 
we grew rapidly in fiscal and experienced difficulties associated with that growth in fiscal in march  the company announced the resignation of steven lupinacci  president and chief executive officer 
we took a restructuring charge of million for closing coffeehouses in fiscal in addition to closing of these coffeehouses  we opened new coffeehouses in houston  texas as well as irvine and santa monica  california 
we also entered into an agreement to place coffee carts at premium office locations in orange county  california  six carts were operating under this agreement at fiscal year end mr 
lawrence goelman became chairman of the board and interim chief executive officer on march  kerry coin was appointed president and chief operating officer on april  under the board s direction  management developed and executed a turnaround plan intended to return diedrich coffee to operating profitability 
underperforming stores were closed  leases assigned  terminated or sublet and new channels of distribution were developed 
experienced professional managers were recruited 
the wholesale division was given aggressive growth targets and the resources needed to meet them 
new management and training systems were developed and implemented 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we raised million of working capital through the private placement of secured debt 
on november   the board appointed mr 
john e 
martin as chairman of the board and mr 
timothy j 
ryan as president and chief executive officer 
despite the efforts of the interim management team led by messrs 
goelman and coin  diedrich coffee did not meet its stated goal of cash flow positive operating results by the end of the last quarter of fiscal the reasons for the shortfall were several the increased general and administrative costs associated with the addition of the new executive management team headed by john martin and tim ryan  inadequate and unsuccessful marketing programs  delays in the installation of coffee carts in orange county and inadequate management of certain labor costs 
messrs 
martin and ryan determined that  while the turnaround plan implemented by the interim management team had stabilized diedrich coffee operationally  it was not likely to result in profitable growth in the near future 
accordingly  they initiated a business planning process that resulted in a strategic five year plan directed toward growth through franchise area development agreements combined with focused company unit growth and centralization of production facilities 
this plan also built on the interim management strategy of developing new wholesale business channels 
new management also reviewed the existing asset base and determined that one coffeehouse designated for closure would remain open and two additional coffeehouses and the denver warehouse would be closed 
charges for these closures as well as provisions for other contingencies resulted in additional operating expenses of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal according to diedrich coffee s strategic plan  the roasting facility in denver  colorado was closed in the first quarter of fiscal and roasting was consolidated in southern california 
we also closed an under performing store in san diego  california and one in denver  colorado 
four coffee cart locations at premium office buildings owned by the irvine company were opened in the first quarter of fiscal management undertook several steps to ensure that the base business was operating well before initiating the franchising sales program 
it upgraded the quality of the store management teams and then undertook a program to retrain every diedrich coffeehouse employee 
this program was completed during fiscal the team also developed  tested and introduced several new product programs  including martin diedrich signature coffee selections featuring coffee beans that were only available in the united states at diedrich coffeehouses  a line of five new icy blended drinks to address seasonal softness in the warmer months  chai tea and new mocha products  including white chocolate mocha  were added to the menu  and a new line of holiday merchandise 
on july   we completed the acquisition of coffee people  inc under the terms of the merger agreement  coffee people stockholders received million in cash and million shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was funded from the proceeds of an offering of million shares of the company s stock 
the coffee people brands acquired as a result of the merger include coffee people  coffee plantation  and gloria jean s 
we intend to eventually convert the coffee people and coffee plantation coffeehouses to the diedrich brand 
on september   after years as our president and ceo  timothy j 
ryan announced his retirement from diedrich coffee 
effective september   mr

franchise area development agreements management s franchise development goals are to enter into franchise area development agreements covering major us markets 
as of june   diedrich coffee had a total of eight area development agreements with commitments for coffeehouses  although one agreement has been terminated since june   and we anticipate the termination of one additional franchise area development agreement in the coming year  which will reduce the number of coffeehouse commitments to to date  three coffeehouses have opened under existing franchise area development agreements and franchised diedrich coffee coffeehouses are anticipated to open in fiscal year management is currently in various stages of discussion and or negotiations with additional potential area developers 
to augment our franchising efforts  diedrich coffee added a full time vice president of franchising  joseph e 
caruso  and additional experienced franchising resources that we have devoted to improving our franchise recruitment capabilities and capture rate 
there can be no assurances of positive sales results from these activities 
wholesale in fiscal diedrich coffee took significant steps to build its wholesale sales organization and grow this business channel 
a new director of the wholesale division  with substantial experience in the coffee business  was hired and the sales staff expanded 
these efforts were successful in fiscal  when wholesale sales grew to  of total sales  an increase of from the prior year 
in fiscal  the wholesale division focused its efforts on upgrading coffee consumed at chain restaurants 
as a result  diedrich coffee added regional divisions of a number of well known restaurant groups as wholesale customers such as islands restaurants  inc  ruth s chris steakhouses california arizona locations  culinary adventures and claim jumper

the results of operations for the year ended june  differ significantly from all prior periods presented because of this acquisition 
change in fiscal year 
in an effort to align our fiscal year with that of coffee people which diedrich coffee acquired on july   we changed our year end from a fiscal year ending the wednesday nearest january to a fiscal year ending on the wednesday nearest june accordingly  the following results of operations include a discussion for the year ended june  compared to the year ended january  and a discussion of the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  in addition  the following results of operations includes a discussion of the week transition period ended june  compared to the weeks ended june   as the seasonal nature of the company s business does now allow for a meaningful comparison of annualized results for the twenty two week period ended june   to the fiscal year ended june  year ended june  compared to year ended january  total revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the year ended january  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of coffee people 
retail revenues for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of company operated retail coffeehouses in oregon and arizona from coffee people  and to a lesser degree acquired company operated gloria jean s mall stores 
wholesale and mail order revenues for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the gloria jean s franchisee operations  which purchases roasted coffee from diedrich coffee 
since diedrich coffee realizes a normal wholesale profit margin on its sale of roasted coffee beans to its gloria jean s franchisees  these revenues and related contribution are recorded in the wholesale division s operating results

cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the year ended january  as a percentage of total revenue from retail and wholesale  cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended january  this increase is primarily related to the lower margin received on coffee and products sold to gloria jean s franchisees in the later period versus sales to retail customers and unrelated wholesale accounts in the earlier period  and the impact of increased occupancy costs 
store operating expenses 
for the year ended june   store operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenue from retail and franchise  increased to from for the year ended january  this increase can be attributed to an increase in labor expense due to additional staff training at the store level  as well as the addition of the coffee people oregon stores

as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in the year ended june  from for the year ended january  due to a reduction of general and administrative expenses relative to sales as revenue flows increased and successful execution of the new business plan 
the overall level of general and administrative expense is directly related to management s commitment to grow diedrich coffee through the continued development of company owned and franchise locations plus new wholesale channels 
interest expense

cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended january  decreased to  from  for the year ended january  as a percentage of total revenues from retail and wholesale  cost of sales and related occupancy costs decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decreased percentage was the result of average unit volume efficiencies resulting from the closure of low volume locations  lower green coffee prices as well as purchasing efficiencies and the additional efficiencies gained at the coffeehouse level 
these more than offset the impact of increased occupancy costs  and an increase in the percentage of total revenues contributed by wholesale revenue

liquidity and capital resources diedrich coffee had working capital deficit  as of june   of  compared to  at june  cash used in operating activities totaled  for the year ended june  as compared to cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended january  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  totaled  which consisted primarily of the acquisition of coffee people and capital expenditures for property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  totaled  this consists of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from the term loan  net of proceeds on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
on july   diedrich coffee completed a secondary offering of  shares including an over allotment option 
all of the shares of common stock were sold on behalf of diedrich coffee  of which  shares of common stock were sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the net proceeds of the offering to diedrich coffee  after deducting approximately million in underwriters commissions and related expenses  were approximately million 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement with bankboston  na subsequently merged into fleet national bank secured by pledges of all of diedrich coffee s assets and its subsidiaries stock and which provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
diedrich coffee used the proceeds of the term loan to repay existing indebtedness and to pay expenses related to the acquisition of coffee people 
the term loan provided for principal repayment based upon a five year amortization  with quarterly principal payments of  and quarterly interest payments based upon a formula described below 
diedrich coffee established the revolving credit facility for future flexibility to remodel existing company owned coffeehouses  develop new company coffeehouses  and for general corporate purposes 
diedrich coffee has not drawn down any borrowings under the revolving credit facility since it was established  although it presently has  of outstanding letters of credit backed by the revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at fleet s base rate plus or an adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
due to problems with the gloria jean s unit acquired from coffee people  including the closure of gloria jean s locations  of which were company owned  in the year subsequent to the acquisition  we announced on june  that we expected to be in default under our credit agreement because of our inability to meet certain financial covenants 
we simultaneously announced that on june   we entered into a letter agreement with fleet national bank under which the bank agreed to extend the due date of the june  quarterly principal payment until july   and to forbear until july  from exercising any of its rights and remedies arising from financial covenant defaults 
we subsequently made the july  principal payment as required on the extended due date  and on august  we entered into an extension of the june  letter agreement which extended through september  the bank s forbearance from exercising any of its default remedies 
on september   we entered into a first amendment to credit agreement with fleet national bank to amend certain terms of the original credit agreement 
the first amendment to credit agreement provides  among other things  for a significant reduction in required minimum principal amortization payments going forward  an acceleration in the maturity date of all amounts owed under the credit agreement  an agreement between the parties as to certain assets intended to be sold as well as the allocation of future net asset sale proceeds between the company and the bank  the introduction of an additional event of default under the agreement  a reduction in the overall amount of the revolving credit facility and certain new restrictions governing use of the facility  and a modification of the financial covenants and the company s ability to obtain new third party debt going forward 
specifically  under the terms of the first amendment to credit agreement  no further principal payments on the term loan are required from august  until january  the company must then pay minimum principal payments of  per month beginning february   which increase to  per month beginning july  until all amounts owed under the credit agreement are repaid 
the first amendment to credit agreement accelerates the final maturity date of all remaining amounts owed under the credit agreement to september  in addition  the company and the bank identified certain assets that could be sold without interfering with the company s growth strategy  including two pieces of owned real property under existing company retail locations  which will be leased back from the buyer  a third parcel of owned real property  presently undeveloped  and certain company operated coffeehouses outside of its core southern california market that could be refranchised with area development agreements 
under the terms of the first amendment to credit agreement  the bank will receive of the net proceeds from any such asset sales 
we intend to commence these sales as soon as possible 
the interest rate and the timing of quarterly interest payments under the original credit agreement remain unchanged under the first amendment to credit agreement 
the amendment also introduces an additional event of default under the agreement 
the amendment specifies that a materially adverse change in the financial condition of diedrich coffee or any of our subsidiaries  as determined by the bank in its sole and exclusive discretion  is defined as an event of default 
under any event of default  the bank may declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable 
additional changes to the credit agreement under the terms of the first amendment to credit agreement include a reduction in the revolving credit facility  which the company had previously been unable to access because of the covenant defaults  from a  limit to  and a restriction that the reduced facility be used only to back up existing and future standby letters of credit 
the first amendment to credit agreement preserves the company s ability to obtain third party financing for capital projects and maintenance capital  and increases its flexibility to obtain subordinated debt as a source of additional working capital 
under the first amendment to credit agreement the bank waived the previous financial covenant defaults  and agreed to new financial covenant ratios going forward based upon updated financial information and projections prepared by the company 
in addition to resetting such ratios in the financial covenants as contained in the original credit agreement  the parties agreed to a new covenant under the first amendment to credit agreement which commits the company to achieving certain minimum levels of cumulative principal repayments in addition to amounts already paid to date in fiscal or reflected in the new go forward minimum monthly principal payment obligations discussed above  by march   by june   and  by september  such incremental principal repayments above the scheduled minimum monthly amounts described above are anticipated to be generated primarily from the of net proceeds to be paid to the bank from future asset sales  the issuance of new debt or equity  or a combination of these sources 
diedrich coffee believes that cash from operations and asset sales will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs at the anticipated operating levels  including its obligations under its credit agreement modified as described above  for the next twelve months 
effect of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after december  diedrich coffee has not determined whether the application of this accounting standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
this staff accounting bulletin summarizes certain of the staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  is effective for the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purpose of applying accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  diedrich coffee does not believe that the impact of fin will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operation 
other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as well as economic trends that affect retailers in general 
historically  our net sales have not been realized proportionately in each quarter  with net sales being the highest during the last fiscal quarter which includes the december holiday season 
hot weather tends to reduce sales 
quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  which may not occur as anticipated due to events outside our control 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
year we have addressed the potential business and operational risks associated with the year the year issue involved the use of a two digit year field instead of a four digit year field in the computer systems 
if computer systems cannot distinguish between the year and the year  system failures or other computer errors could result 
to date  diedrich coffee is not aware of the occurrence of any significant year problems being reported 
some business risks associated with the year issue may remain throughout however  it is not anticipated that future year issues  if any  will have a material adverse effect on diedrich coffee 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
diedrich coffee does not and did not invest in market risk sensitive instruments in the fiscal from time to time  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future at prices to be determined within two to twelve months of the time of actual purchase 
at june  these commitments totaled  these agreements are tied to specific market prices defined by both the origin of the coffee and the month of delivery but diedrich coffee has significant flexibility in selecting the date of the market price to be used in each contract 
diedrich coffee does not use commodity based financial instruments to hedge coffee or any other commodity diedrich coffee as believes there will continue to be a high probability of maintaining a strong correlation between increases in green coffee prices and the final selling prices of diedrich coffee s products 
market risk 
diedrich coffee s market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in the adjusted eurodollar rate 
we borrowed  at the adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in the adjusted eurodollar rate would result in additional interest expense of  on an annualized basis 
diedrich coffee does not and has not used derivative financial instruments for any purpose  including hedging or mitigating interest rate risk
