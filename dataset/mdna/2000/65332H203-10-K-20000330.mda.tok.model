the distribution agreement specified that products were sold to baxter at the current global suggested retail price srp independently established by the company less a predetermined distributor margin of 
the term of the distribution agreement was originally for eleven years with provisions to extend or terminate upon mutual agreement and allowed for annual adjustments to the pricing structure 
however  any price increases were limited to actual increases in the fully loaded product cost and the increase in the us consumer price index from the prior year 
the effect of such future increases in product cost on gross margins was minimal as the srp was also tied to the fully loaded cost increases 
the distribution agreement provided for an increased distributor margin based on the extent to which baxter was able to meet or exceed agreed upon sales projections contained in the distribution agreement for that year

the sales were comprised of two components

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company maintains excess cash in a mutual fund  the blackrock low duration bond portfolio the fund  which invests in asset backed securities  bonds and various other commercial obligations 
the fund may  from time to time  use certain derivatives in its investment strategy 
two of the main risks disclosed by the fund are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of bonds such as those held by the fund 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the bond will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
the company addresses these risks by actively monitoring the fund s performance and investment holdings 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash as well as the value of the mutual fund in which excess cash is invested 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment of excess cash in a mutual fund  which invests in asset backed securities  bonds and various other commercial obligations 
the fund may  from time to time  use certain derivatives in its investment strategy 
the fund s portfolio managers make all investment decisions and the company has no control over such investment decisions or the fund s use of derivatives 
foreign currency risk changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to date  the company has not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as its international operations grow  the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk
