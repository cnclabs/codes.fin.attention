item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview in december  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of petrini from gruppo spigadoro  nv as a result of the transaction  we changed our name from iat multimedia  inc to spigadoro  inc 
in consideration for the petrini shares  we o issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  of which  shares were issued  at gruppo spigadoro s request  to carlo petrini  our co chairman  to satisfy part of gruppo spigadoro s obligation to mr 
petrini  and o assumed approximately million of short term indebtedness of gruppo spigadoro  of which approximately million has been repaid 
all of the indebtedness will be payable or convertible into common stock during see business restructuring and recent transactions 
as a result of this transaction  we changed the focus of our business from the sale of computers and computer components and peripherals to the production and sale of food products  including animal feed and pasta and flour products 
our animal feed business produces feed for industrial breeders  family owned breeding farms and domestic pets 
our pasta and flour business produces traditional  specialty and diet pastas and flours for the use of bakery industry 
we also engage  to a lesser extent  in animal breeding  selling gardening articles and supplying accessories for pets 
our animal feed business and our pasta and flour business represented approximately and approximately  respectively  of our revenues in virtually all of our sales of animal feed are in italy  while approximately of our pasta and flour products are exported to the united states  europe and southeast asia 
we continue to distribute personal computer components  peripherals and software  as well as personal computers  in germany through our subsidiary columbus computer handel and its affiliates 
we intend to sell columbus and have commenced discussions relating to the sale of columbus  but no agreement has been reached with any party regarding the terms of a potential transaction and we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell this business on terms favorable to us or at all 
see business restructuring and recent transactions and note to the consolidated financial statements of spigadoro 
as a result of the petrini transaction  we issued a controlling amount of our common stock to the stockholders of petrini and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
in a reverse acquisition  although we were the legal acquiror  petrini is considered the acquiror for accounting purposes 
therefore  the financial statements for all periods presented prior to the december  acquisition date are the financial statements of petrini 
for all periods subsequent to december   the financial statements are the financial statements of petrini and spigadoro 
as a result of our change in business strategy prior to the petrini transaction  we discontinued  for accounting purposes  all of our operations related to the distribution of personal computers and personal computer components  peripherals and software 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements of spigadoro 
since all of our operations are currently in italy  our functional currency is the italian lire 
therefore  our financial statements are presented in lire for financial statement reporting 
all amounts stated in us dollars have been translated into us dollars for the convenience of the reader at the rate of lire  us  which approximates the noon buying rate of the federal reserve bank of new york on december  in the following discussions  most percentages and lire and us dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
result of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in sales prices to our customers resulting from a decrease in raw material costs  partially offset by a slight increase in total sales volume to  tons in from  tons in net sales for animal feed for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december   while the sales volume was unchanged at approximately  tons for the years ended december  and net sales for pasta and flour for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  despite an increase of in sale volumes resulting from new marketing campaigns

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume  which decreased by to  tons in from  tons in and decreases in the prices of raw materials which resulted in lower sales prices to our customers 
net sales for animal feed for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  during  our animal feed sales volumes decreased primarily as the result of o reduced european union milk quotas  which reduced demand for feed for dairy cows  o lower pork prices  which reduced demand for pig feed  and o continued concern relating to mad cow disease  which reduced demand for beef cattle 
net sales for pasta and flour for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  in pasta and flour  aggressive pricing strategies by the italian pasta market leader  barilla  led to a reduction in our sales volumes 
we chose to raise our own prices marginally in order to enhance our premium quality positioning and maintain margins as raw material prices increased during which resulted in a slight decrease in our sales volumes 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  gross margins for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margins was primarily due  in pasta and flour  to our polices of maintaining premium pricing in our pasta brands  and  in animal feed  to our policy of reformulating certain feed products to take advantage of lower raw material prices 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  comprising of selling costs and general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million  or of net sales  from lire billion million  or net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a reduction in labor costs as central overhead costs were marginally reduced in light of declining sales activity 
income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased gross margins as well as a decrease in operating expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates on our borrowing during this period 
income before taxes

net income for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion  from lire billion  for the year ended december  in  income taxes were lire billion million or of pretax income  due to the italian system for computing taxation  which fluctuates based on both a regional tax on production activities and a national tax based on taxable income 
ebitda 
ebitda for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  ebitda increased primarily as a result of the matters described above 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to income from operations  net income  cash flow or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents increased to lire billion million from to lire billion  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was lire billion million during the year ended december  compared to lire billion million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a reduction of trade accounts receivable in the amount of lire billion million as a result of the factoring of certain of our accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in cash used to repay trade accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to lire billion million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of lire billion million for the year ended december  in both periods cash was primarily used for the purchase of machinery and equipment for production 
this use of cash was offset in the year ending december  by lire billion million as a result of the net cash of spigadoro acquired in the reverse acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities totaled lire billion million during the year ended december  and lire billion million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to cash used to reduce short term borrowings by lire billion million  partially offset by an increase in long term debt 
at december   our total indebtedness increased to lire billion million compared to lire billion million at december  primarily due to the assumption of indebtedness in the acquisition of petrini  partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowings 
at december   we had short term debt in the aggregate amount of lire billion million comprised of borrowings under short term credit facilities and indebtedness assumed in the acquisition of petrini 
we maintain unsecured short term credit facilities with over italian banks 
these facilities are typically available for terms up to one year and accrue interest at rates that fluctuate relative to the official italian rate of discount 
at december   the aggregate amount outstanding under these facilities was lire billion million and approximately lire billion million was unused and available for borrowing 
borrowings under these facilities are used to support petrini s operations and are serviced by cash flow from operations 
at december   the aggregate amount outstanding under the promissory notes issued in the acquisition of petrini was lire billion million 
all of this debt is payable in at december   we had long term debt in the aggregate amount of lire billion million 
the debt matures over varying terms ranging from june to march and accrues interest either at fixed annual interest rates ranging from to or variable rates based upon various interest rates measures 
substantially all of the long term debt is secured by liens on petrini s property 
a portion of the long term debt is subsidized by government agencies 
in june  we entered into a factoring arrangement whereby we sell a portion of our accounts receivable without recourse 
a portion of the proceeds of this arrangement have been used to pay short term and long term indebtedness while the remaining proceeds have been used for working capital 
we intend to expand our factoring activity in the future and believe that it will result in increased cash and decreased short term debt  while increasing our flexibility to incur additional indebtedness if necessary or advisable to execute our consolidation strategy 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of spigadoro 
in february  we sold in a series of transactions  shares of capital stock of algo vision plc  for approximately million in cash 
see business restructuring and recent transactions 
in november   jnc converted  of the outstanding principal amount of our convertible debenture  plus accrued interest  into a total of  shares of our common stock and in december  jnc converted the remaining principal amount of the debenture  plus accrued interest  into  shares of our common stock 
in addition  in december jnc converted the  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock into  shares of our common stock 
see business restructuring and recent transactions 
we believe that our funds  including cash generated from operations and from the sale of our algo vision shares  together with amounts available under our credit facilities and factoring arrangements  should be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and our capital and debt service requirements for approximately the month period following december   depending on acquisitions 
we may require additional funds for acquisitions and integration and management of acquired business 
however  we have no commitments or arrangements to obtain any additional funds and we cannot predict whether additional funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we cannot obtain funds when required  the growth of our business may be adversely affected 
escrow shares in connection with our initial public offering in march  certain of our stockholders placed an aggregate of  shares of our common stock into escrow 
we expect that the  shares held in escrow will be canceled on march  year compliance we recognized the importance of the year issue and established a project team which was responsible for ensuring an uninterrupted transition to the year by assessing  testing and modifying our information technology and non it systems so that such systems and software would perform as intended and information and dates could be processed with expected results 
the scope of the year compliance effort included i it such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology  and iii the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers  and the electronic date interchange with those key third parties 
independent of the year issue  we installed new financial accounting  procurement  order management and invoicing systems 
we have developed a contingency plan to deal with certain critical year situations should they arise 
under our year contingency plan  we have and will continue to inventory and collect documentation on all of our computers  computer related equipment  and equipment with embedded processors 
in addition  we will continue to monitor and test systems as necessary 
we have also communicated with significant vendors  suppliers and critical business partners to determine the extent to which we might be vulnerable in the event those parties failed to properly remediate their own year issues 
based on those communications  we believe that our significant vendors  suppliers and critical business partners are year compliant 
we believe that we are currently year compliant 
all of our operating systems have continued to function beyond january  without any business interruption 
as the year progresses  however  we may experience problems associated with the year that have not yet been discovered 
there can be no assurances that our internal systems or those of third parties on which we rely will not suffer disruptions relating to year issues 
the failure to achieve year compliance or to have appropriate contingency plans in place to deal with any noncompliance could result in significant disruption of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on the assessments described above  we estimate that we spent approximately  to update our operating systems  only a portion of which was attributable to year compliance
