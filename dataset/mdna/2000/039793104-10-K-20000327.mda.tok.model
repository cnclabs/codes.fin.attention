item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that owns  manages  leases  develops  renovates and acquires commercial properties located in southern california 
we are a full service real estate organization managed by senior executive officers who have an average of years of experience in the real estate industry 
we perform all property management  accounting  finance and acquisition activities and a majority of our leasing transactions with our own staff of approximately employees 
we are southern california s largest publicly traded office landlord as measured by total net rentable square feet owned  as of december  since our formation in  we have acquired properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of primarily office properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet and three properties with approximately  net rentable square feet under development 
as of december   our properties were approximately leased  excluding three existing properties under renovation 
our primary business strategy is to actively manage our portfolio to achieve gains in occupancy and rental rates  maximize income from ancillary operations and services and to reduce operating expenses 
when market conditions permit  we may also develop or acquire new properties in submarkets where we can use our local market expertise and extensive real estate experience 
results of operations our financial position and operating results are primarily comprised of our portfolio of commercial properties and income derived from those properties 
therefore  financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of significant property acquisitions

revenue from rental operations for the properties we owned for all of and computed on a gaap basis increased by approximately million in compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in rental rates and a four percentage point increase in average occupancy in for this pool of properties representing approximately million net rentable square feet 
this increase in occupancy not only contributed to higher rental revenue but also resulted in higher tenant expense reimbursements  parking income and miscellaneous tenant charges 
miscellaneous tenant charges include revenue from after hour utility billings  signage  satellite income and lease termination settlements 
lease termination settlements totaled approximately million in compared to million in for these properties 
excluding only the straight line rent adjustments for these properties  revenue from rental operations  computed on a cash basis  increased by approximately million for the reasons described above

miscellaneous tenant charges include revenue from after hour utility billings  signage  satellite income and lease termination settlements 
lease termination settlements totaled approximately million in compared to  in for these properties 
these increases were partially offset by lower tenant expense reimbursements in  primarily due to resetting base years for leases that were retenanted in and the reversing effect of straight line rent adjustments on specific properties in excluding only the straight line rent adjustments for these properties  revenue from rental operations  computed on a cash basis  increased by approximately million for the reasons described above

capital commitments as of december   we had approximately million outstanding in capital commitments related to tenant improvements  development  renovation costs and property related capital expenditures 
available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources we have a million unsecured line of credit from a group of banks led by wells fargo 
this line of credit bears interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus  depending on our leverage ratio 
the agreement governing this line of credit provides for the rate to be lowered to between libor plus and libor plus  depending on our unsecured debt rating 
under specified circumstances  we have the option to convert the interest rate to the prime rate plus 
this line of credit has a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused balance 
as of december   the effective interest rate on this line of credit was  the aggregate outstanding balance on this line of credit was million  and million was available for additional borrowing 
this line of credit matures on june  proceeds from this line of credit have been used  among other things  to fund acquisitions  provide funds for tenant improvements  capital expenditures and provide for working capital 
we also have an unsecured line of credit with a total commitment of million from city national bank 
this line of credit accrues interest at the city national bank prime rate less and is scheduled to mature on august  as of december   the effective interest rate on this line of credit was  there was an outstanding balance of million  and million was available for additional borrowing 
proceeds from this line of credit have been used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and provide for working capital and other purposes 
on january   we increased our prepayable term loan with an affiliate of lehman brothers from million to million 
this loan was secured by seven of our properties  bore interest at libor plus per year and required monthly payments of interest only 
as discussed below  we refinanced this loan on may  on april   we closed a million loan with mass mutual life insurance company that is secured by twelve of our properties  has a year term  bears interest at a fixed rate of  requires monthly payments of principal and interest and is amortized over a year period 
proceeds from this loan were used to repay million of our prepayable term loan with an affiliate of lehman brothers and to repay a portion of our lines of credit 
on april  we closed a million loan with an affiliate of lehman brothers that is secured by three of our properties  has a year term  bears interest at a fixed rate of  requires monthly payments of principal and interest and is amortized over a year period 
proceeds from this loan were used to repay a portion of our lines of credit 
on may   we refinanced the remaining million outstanding under our loan with an affiliate of lehman brothers with a promissory note for million that is secured by three of our properties  bears interest at libor plus per year  requires monthly payments of interest only and matures on november  this loan had an effective interest rate of at december  the remaining proceeds from this loan were used to repay a portion of our lines of credit 
on july   we entered into a construction loan with a total commitment of million related to our development of the approximately  net rentable square foot center drive office building in the howard hughes center 
this loan is secured by specific property and construction improvements  bears interest at libor plus  requires monthly payments of interest only  and matures on december   with two one year extension options 
if we meet construction completion and leasing benchmarks  the interest rate on the construction loan may be reduced to libor plus  and then to libor plus 
as of december   the effective interest rate of this loan was  there was an outstanding principal balance of million and million was available for additional borrowing 
on july   we closed a million prepayable term loan with an affiliate of lehman brothers 
this loan is secured by six of our properties and has the same terms as the loan that was increased on may   as described above 
proceeds from this loan were used to repay a portion of our lines of credit and to fund specific capital expenditures 
on september   the operating partnership completed a million private placement of two million series b cumulative redeemable preferred units to an institutional investor 
these preferred units are callable by us after five years and are exchangeable after years by the holder into our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock on a one for one basis 
the preferred units have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption and are subordinated to all debt 
we used the net proceeds from this private placement to repay a portion of our lines of credit 
on january   we expanded one of our two prepayable term loans with an affiliate of lehman brothers totaling million by million  resulting in a combined outstanding balance of million for both loans 
the two loans are secured by nine of our properties  bear interest at libor plus per year  require monthly payments of interest only and mature on november  these loans had an effective interest rate of at december  proceeds from this loan expansion were used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements  capital expenditures and working capital

based on contractual rates effective at december  that expire through february  assuming market libor rates at december   the unsecured debt and floating rate debt weighted average interest rates would have been and  respectively  while the total debt weighted average interest rate would have been 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash  representing million in interest bearing cash deposits required by some of our mortgage loans payable 
in addition  we had million in cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by several of our mortgage loans payable 
as of december   we had million available under our lines of credit 
on march   the operating partnership issued million of senior unsecured notes in two tranches  with million at an interest rate of due in march and million at an interest rate of due in march these notes will be the operating partnership s senior unsecured obligations and pay interest semi annually on march  and september  of each year 
net proceeds from this offering were used to repay two prepayable term loans to an affiliate of lehman brothers described above totaling million  a million mortgage loan and approximately million under our unsecured lines of credit 
these senior unsecured notes were issued in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by section a under the securities act 
as part of issuing these notes  the operating partnership has agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission within days after the notes are issued  enabling the holders of the notes to exchange the privately placed notes for publicly traded notes with identical terms other than those pertaining to transfer restrictions and liquidated damages 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our net cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds from our lines of credit 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to pay any distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of capital will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs  other than scheduled debt principal repayments  for the foreseeable future  including recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet long term liquidity and capital requirements  such as scheduled debt principal repayments  renovation costs  property acquisitions and other non recurring capital expenditures  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity or equity related securities 
funds from operations the following table reflects the calculation of our funds from operations for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  funds from operations net income    depreciation and amortization    minority interest    distributions on preferred operating partnership units  funds from operations    company s share percentage company s share of funds from operations    we consider funds from operations  as defined by nareit to be a useful financial measure of our operating performance 
we believe that funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate our ability to service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our financial performance  as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 
funds from operations also is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to service our debt 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines funds from operations as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses  from extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper which may differ from the standards used by other reits and  accordingly  our funds from operations may not be comparable to other reits 
excludes  in distributions made to the former minority partners in the world savings office property 
impact of year in  we completed our remediation and testing of systems with respect to the year date change 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we incurred costs of approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
forward looking statements this form k  including the documents incorporated herein by reference  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act pertaining to  among other things  our future results of operations  cash available for distribution  acquisitions  lease renewals  property development  property renovation  capital requirements and general business  industry and economic conditions applicable to us 
also  documents we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission and incorporated herein by reference will contain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and the matters set forth or incorporated in this form k generally 
we caution the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive  particularly with respect to future filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure or loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
interest rate risk in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may use a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
some of our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates of interest  such as libor 
based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december   a increase in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured notes receivable would not have a material impact on annual future earnings  cash flows and the fair value of the secured notes receivable 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  however  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k readers should carefully consider the following factors 
real estate investment risks an inability to retain tenants or rent space upon lease expirations may adversely affect our ability to service our debt 
over the next five years   leases comprising of our leased net rentable square footage and of our annualized base rents at december   will expire 
if we are unable to promptly relet or renew leases for all or a substantial portion of this space  or if the rent upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected  our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions and to pay our debt obligations could be adversely affected 
our operating performance and property values will be affected by changes in the economic climate in southern california 
all of our properties are located in southern california 
our revenue and the value of our properties may be affected by a number of factors  including the southern california economic climate and real estate market  which could adversely affect the amounts available for distributions and to pay our debt obligations 
competition affects occupancy levels and rents which could adversely affect our revenue 
many office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of the competing properties may be newer  better located or owned by parties better capitalized than we are 
the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the rents we can charge and our ability to lease space in our existing properties or at newly acquired or developed properties 
the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow 
tenants may experience a downturn in their business which may cause them to miss rental payments when due or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of their leases or a delay in recovering possession of their premises 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies  we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
that illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended  may under specified circumstances impose a prohibited transaction tax on the profits derived from our sale of properties held for fewer than four years  which could affect our ability to sell our properties 
increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our revenue 
except for our triple net leases  tax increases are generally not passed through to tenants under our leases 
therefore  any tax increases may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
our properties are also subject to various federal  california and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act  and california and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with these regulatory requirements and that any noncompliance would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you  however  that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions and to pay our debt obligations 
we may acquire properties through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties that could result in financial dependency and management conflicts 
although we currently do not have plans to do so  we may participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships in the future 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present  including our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
we will  however  seek to maintain sufficient control of any partnerships or joint ventures with which we may become involved to permit our business objectives to be achieved 
we may not be able to integrate or finance our acquisitions and renovation activities and our acquisitions and renovations may not perform as expected 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including lease up and tenant retention 
in addition  our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with that integration or effectively manage additional properties or that newly acquired properties will perform as expected 
changing market conditions  including competition from other purchasers of suburban office properties  may diminish our opportunities for attractive additional acquisitions 
we intend to expand and renovate our properties from time to time 
expansion and renovation projects generally require expenditures of capital as well as various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
while our policies with respect to expansion and renovation activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with these activities  we will nevertheless incur risks  including expenditures of funds on  and devotion of our time to  projects that may not be completed 
we may not be able to integrate or finance our development activities 
we also intend to review  from time to time  opportunities for developing and constructing office buildings and other commercial properties in accordance with our development and underwriting policies 
risks associated with our development and construction activities may include abandonment of development opportunities due to a lack of financing or other reasons  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and development activities would also be subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
we may not be able to expand into new markets successfully 
while we have generally limited our business primarily to the southern california market  it is possible that we will in the future expand our business to new geographic markets 
we will not initially possess the same level of familiarity with new markets outside of southern california  which could adversely affect our ability to manage  lease  develop or acquire properties in new localities 
financing risks our significant amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million in secured debt and approximately million of unsecured debt 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our substantial indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisition and development activity and other business purposes  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  limit our ability to refinance our debt and obtain additional debt financing  and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and real estate industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the real estate industry 
we may be able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
despite current indebtedness levels  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future 
we may borrow up to a maximum of million under our existing lines of credit 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks could intensify and could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness 
scheduled debt payments and rising interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing 
cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness  which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity  and  if we can  the terms of the refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
in addition  at december   approximately of our debt was variable rate debt 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available to pay distributions and service our debt 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase our risks as to the other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements could be unenforceable 
many of our properties are subject to mortgage financing which could result in foreclosure if we are unable to pay or refinance the mortgages when due 
we currently have outstanding five mortgage financings totaling million that are secured by of our properties 
the properties in each of these financings are fully cross collateralized and cross defaulted 
to the extent mortgages are cross collateralized  lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties that are not the primary collateral for their loans  which may  in turn  result in acceleration of other debt secured by the properties 
six additional properties are subject to single property mortgages 
if we are unable to meet our obligations under these mortgages  the properties subject to the mortgages could be foreclosed upon  which would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay distributions and service our debt obligations 
tax risks our desire to qualify as a reit restricts our ability to accumulate cash that might be used in future periods to make debt payments or to fund future growth 
in order to qualify as a reit and avoid federal income tax liability  we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gain  and to avoid income taxation  our distributions must not be less than of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
to avoid excise tax liability  our distributions to our shareholders for the year must exceed the sum of of its ordinary income  of its capital gain net income  and any undistributed taxable income from prior years 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
accordingly  these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on our debt obligations and to fund future growth 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  if the operating partnership were a publicly traded partnership  it would be treated as a corporation instead of a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the internal revenue code 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as specified types of real property rents  dividends and interest 
we believe that the operating partnership would meet this test  but we cannot guarantee that it would 
if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation  it would incur substantial tax liabilities and we would fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
although we believe that we have been and will continue to be organized and have operated and will continue to operate so as to qualify for taxation as a reit  we cannot assure you that we have been or will continue to be organized or operated in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
for us to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and tests regarding various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within arden realty s control 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit  like us  that hold our assets through an investment in a partnership 
no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of qualification 
we are  however  not aware of any pending legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a reit 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code  the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by our tax counsel 
if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
if we were disqualified as a reit  our ability to raise additional capital could be significantly impaired 
this could reduce the funds we would have available to pay distributions to our stockholders and to service our debt 
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  if we have net income from a prohibited transaction  specifically sales or other taxable dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  that income will be subject to a tax 
other risks we are subject to agreements and policies that may deter change in control offers that might be attractive to our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws as well as our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  may delay  defer or prevent a third party from making offers to acquire us or control over us 
for example  such provisions may deter tender offers for our common stock  which offers may be attractive to the stockholders 
deter purchases of large blocks of common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 
our charter contains a provision designed to prevent a concentration of ownership among our stockholders that would cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of common stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals  including specific kinds of entities  at any time during the last half of our taxable year 
in addition  if we  or an owner of or more of our stock  actually or constructively owns or more of a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  the rent received by us from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
in order to protect us against the risk of losing reit status  the ownership limit included in our charter limits actual or constructive ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock by any single stockholder to  by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the then outstanding shares of common stock 
actual or constructive ownership of shares of common stock in excess of the ownership limit will cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void with respect to the transferee or owner as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit and such shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations 
that transferee or owner will have no right to vote such shares or be entitled to dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares 
although our board of directors presently has no intention of doing so  except as described below  our board of directors could waive this restriction with respect to a particular stockholder if it were satisfied  based upon the advice of counsel or a ruling from the internal revenue service  that ownership by such stockholder in excess of the ownership limit would not jeopardize our status as a reit and our board of directors otherwise decided such action would be in our best interests 
our board of directors has waived our ownership limit with respect to mr 
ziman and certain family members and affiliates and has permitted these parties to actually and constructively own up to of the outstanding shares of common stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to cause us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or classify any unissued and reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of preferred stock and  with respect to the preferred stock  to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time  it could establish a series of preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in august  we declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock 
subject to limited exceptions  these rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  each right will entitle stockholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of our newly created class a junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of our board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 
per right at any time before a person has acquired or more of the outstanding common stock 
the rights plan will expire in august each right entitles its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of our common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the person or group seeking to acquire or more of our common stock will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction which has not been approved by our board of directors  each right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
we may change policies without stockholder approval 
our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies and our policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  debt  capitalization and operations  will be determined by our management 
although we have no present intention to do so  these policies could be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our management and board of directors without a vote of our stockholders 
in addition  we may change policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that the changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and market price of our common stock 
losses in excess of our insurance coverage or uninsured losses could adversely affect our cash flow 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance policies which currently cover all of our properties with specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances 
some losses  however  are generally not insured against because it is not economically feasible to do so 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and  in the case of debt which is recourse to us  we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss would adversely affect our cash flow with respect to the property subject to the loss 
moreover  we would generally be liable for any unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations with respect to the property subject to the loss 
we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
an earthquake could adversely affect our business 
southern california is in a high risk geographical area for earthquakes 
depending upon its magnitude  an earthquake could severely damage our properties which would adversely affect our business 
we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties and the resulting business interruption 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient if there is a major earthquake 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
these costs may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to remediate the contamination on the property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow against the property 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by that person 
some laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
finally  third parties may have claims against the owner of the site based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
specific federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose liability for release of asbestos containing material and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials 
in connection with the ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for those costs 
except for two properties  one of which is currently undergoing abatement activities  we are not aware of any friable asbestos containing materials at any of our properties 
in the past few years  independent environmental consultants have conducted or updated phase i environmental assessments and other environmental investigations as appropriate at our properties 
these environmental site assessments have included  among other things  a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding area and a review of relevant federal  state and historical documents 
soil and groundwater samplings were performed where warranted and remediation  if necessary  has or is being conducted 
the environmental site assessments of our properties identified several properties that may be impacted by known or suspected regional contamination 
the environmental site assessments have not  however  revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that our environmental site assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  we cannot assure you that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products  except as noted above 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties  other than as noted above
