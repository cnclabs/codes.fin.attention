item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company s primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the pricing applicable to its oil production  which is normally priced with reference to a defined benchmark  such as light  sweet crude oil traded on the new york mercantile exchange wti 
actual prices received vary from the benchmark depending on quality and location differentials 
the markets for crude oil historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
during the three year period ended december   wti oil prices fluctuated between a low price of per barrel and a high price of per barrel 
from time to time  it is the company s policy to use financial market transactions  including swaps  collars and options  with creditworthy counterparties  primarily to reduce the risk associated with the pricing of a portion of the oil and natural gas that it sells 
the policy is structured to underpin the company s planned revenues and results of operations 
the company does not enter into financial market transactions for trading purposes 
during the years ended december  and  markets provided the company the opportunity to realize wti benchmark oil prices on average per barrel and per barrel  respectively  above the wti benchmark oil price the company set as part of its annual plan for the period 
during the year ended december   the company did not have any outstanding financial market transactions to hedge against oil price fluctuations 
as a result of financial and commodity market transactions settled during the years ended december  and  the company s risk management program resulted in an average net realization of approximately per barrel and 
per barrel  respectively  lower than if the company had not entered into such transactions 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas sales at the time of settlement of the underlying hedged transaction 
with respect to the sale of oil to be produced by the company  the company has entered into oil price collars with creditworthy counterparties to establish a weighted average minimum wti benchmark price of per barrel and a maximum of per barrel on an aggregate of million barrels of production during the period from january through june as a result  to the extent the average monthly wti price exceeds  the company will pay the counterparties the difference between the average monthly wti price and  and to the extent that the average monthly wti price is below  the counterparties will pay the company the difference between the average monthly wti price and 
in addition  the company has entered into option contracts for an aggregate of  barrels of production during the period from july through september as a result  to the extent the monthly average wti exceeds per barrel  the company will pay the counterparty the difference between the average wti and  and to the extent wti is at or below  the counterparty will pay the company per barrel 
the company used a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in wti oil prices may have on the fair value of these contracts 
at december   the potential decrease in future earnings  assuming a ten percent movement in wti oil prices  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in anticipation of entering into the forward oil sale  in the company purchased wti benchmark call options to retain the ability to benefit from wti price increases above a weighted average price of per barrel 
the volumes and expiration dates on the call options coincide with the volumes and delivery dates of the forward oil sale  which will be completed in march during the years ended december   and  the company recorded a gain loss of million  
million  and million  respectively  in other income expense  net  related to the change in the fair market value of the call options 
in november  the company sold wti benchmark call options with the same notional quantities  strike price and contract period as the remaining call option contracts outstanding for a premium of million for the purpose of realizing the fair value of the purchased call options 
as a result  the company has eliminated its exposure to future changes in value of the call options caused by fluctuating oil prices 
interest rate risk equity swap in conjunction with the sale of tpc  the company entered into an equity swap with a creditworthy financial institution the counterparty 
the equity swap has a notional amount of million and requires the company to make quarterly floating libor based payments on the notional amount to the counterparty 
in exchange  the counterparty is required to make payments to the company equivalent to of the dividends tpc receives in respect of its equity interest in ocensa 
the company s libor based payments commenced in march  and ocensa commenced paying dividends in september ocensa s first dividend was attributable to the four month period ending june during the years ended december  and  the company made payments to the counterparty totaling million and million  respectively  and received payments from the counterparty totaling million and million  respectively 
the equity swap is carried in the company s financial statements at fair value during its term  which  as amended  will expire april  the value of the equity swap in the company s financial statements is equal to of the estimated fair value of the shares of ocensa owned by tpc 
because there is no public market for the shares of ocensa  the company estimates their value using a discounted cash flow model applied to the distributions expected to be paid in respect of the ocensa shares 
the discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows from the ocensa shares is based on a combination of current market rates of interest  a credit spread for ocensa s debt  and a spread to reflect the preferred stock nature of the ocensa shares 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded an expense of million and million in other income expense  net  related to the net payments made under and the change in the fair market value of the equity swap 
the company also evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates could have on the fair value of the equity swap 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual discount rate in effect as of december   and assuming a ten percent adverse movement in the discount rate  the potential decrease in the fair value of the equity swap at december   would be approximately million 
net payments made or received under the equity swap  and any fluctuations in the fair value of the equity swap  in future periods  will affect other income expense  net in such periods 
there can be no assurance that changes in interest rates  or in other factors that affect the value of the ocensa shares and or the equity swap  will not have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the equity swap 
upon the expiration of the equity swap in april  the company expects that the purchaser will sell the tpc shares 
under the terms of the equity swap with the counterparty  upon any sale by the purchaser of the tpc shares  the company will receive from the counterparty  or pay to the counterparty  an amount equal to the excess or deficiency  as applicable  of the difference between of the net proceeds from the purchaser s sale of the tpc shares and the notional amount of million 
for example if the purchaser sold the tpc shares for an amount equal to the value the company has estimated for purposes of preparing its balance sheet as of december   the company would have to make a payment to the counterparty under the equity swap of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the value the purchaser may realize in any sale of the tpc shares will equal the value of the shares estimated by the company for purposes of valuing the equity swap 
the company has no right or obligation to repurchase the tpc shares at any time  but the company is not prohibited from offering to purchase the shares if the purchaser offers to sell them 
the company expects to make a bid for the acquisition of the tpc shares because the company s pipeline tariffs can be lowered by electing to cancel the dividend to the holder of the ocensa shares

indebtedness of the company the company believes its interest rate exposure on debt is not significant since only million out of total debt of million at december   has floating interest rate obligations 
foreign currency risk the company derives substantially all of its consolidated revenues from international operations 
a risk inherent in international operations is the possibility of realizing economic currency exchange losses when transactions are completed in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s risk of realizing currency exchange losses currently is largely mitigated because the company receives us dollars for sales of its petroleum products in colombia 
with respect to expenditures denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the company generally converts us dollars to the local currency near the applicable payment dates to minimize exposure to losses caused by holding foreign currency deposits 
during the three year period ended december   the company did not realize any material foreign exchange losses from its international operations 
the company evaluated the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in foreign exchange rates may have on the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets 
based on analysis utilizing the actual foreign currency exchange rates at december   and assuming a ten percent adverse movement in exchange rates  the potential decrease in fair value of foreign currency denominated assets does not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
