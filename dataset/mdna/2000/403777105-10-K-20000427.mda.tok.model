liquidity and capital resources during and gymboree satisfied its cash requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and from permanent financing as compared to when cash requirements were met exclusively from cash flow from operations and available cash balances 
primary uses of cash during and have been to finance the construction of new domestic and international stores 
comparatively  in fiscal gymboree used cash to purchase outstanding common stock and to increase the average store inventory levels 
we also purchased land and constructed a  square foot distribution center in dixon  california in  which was refinanced with debt in the combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments were million and million at january  and january   respectively 
working capital as of january  was million compared to million at january  the decrease in working capital was due to a decrease in inventory 
during  gymboree generated million of cash from operations primarily reflecting a reduction of inventory of million coupled with depreciation expense of million that more than offset a net loss of million

during  we generated million of cash from operations  million from the sales of investments  million of proceeds on borrowings  and million from the exercise of stock options 
uses of cash consisted primarily of million for capital expenditures  related largely to the opening of new stores and the expansion of existing stores 
as of january   gymboree had an overall credit line of million that may be used for issuance of commercial letters of credit and up to million of standby letters of credit and up to million for cash advances 
as of january   approximately million was available pursuant to such lines 
this facility is scheduled to expire may  gymboree uses these lines primarily to support letters of credit which fund its foreign sourcing of merchandise inventories 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which require gymboree to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and meet certain ratios 
additionally  the facility contains restrictions on capital expenditures 
as of january   gymboree was not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant 
the bank waived non compliance with such covenant 
on march   gymboree accepted its current bank s proposal to enter into a secured credit facility  subject to the bank s audit  approval of the transaction  and the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement with the bank 
this facility will expire three years after the signing of the credit agreement 
the terms of the proposal provide for an overall credit line of million that may be used for issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit and cash advances up to million  limited to eligible receivables and inventory 
the interest rate will be based on the bank s reference rate or libor london interbank offered rate plus a pre determined spread

the second note of approximately million bears interest at 
gymboree estimates that capital expenditures during will be between and million  which will primarily be used to open approximately new domestic and international stores  to expand approximately existing stores and update the store fronts of approximately stores 
we anticipate that cash generated from operations  together with our existing cash resources and funds available from current and future credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through at least fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations gymboree has historically experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our retail sales and net income 
historically  a disproportionate amount of our retail sales and a significant portion of our net income have been realized during the months of november and december 
in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months  gymboree hires a significant number of temporary employees to bolster the store staff 
in addition  we have experienced periods of increased sales activity in early spring and early fall 
if  for any reason  our sales were below seasonal norms during november and december  or during the early spring or early fall  our annual operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
historically  retail sales and net income have been weakest during the second fiscal quarter  and we expect this trend to continue 
gymboree s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the costs and increased overhead associated with the opening and future operation of new stores 
in addition  the sales contributed by new stores  advertising and marketing expenditures  merchandise mix and timing  and level of markdowns may contribute to fluctuations in operating performance 
factors that may affect future performance the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements  including statements regarding future net sales and net income  future inventory levels  future comparable store net sales  future s  g a expenses  future interest income  planned capital expenditures  planned store expansions and closings  international expansion and future cash needs 
such forward looking statements  in particular  and gymboree s business and operating results  in general  involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
future operating results will depend upon many factors  including general economic conditions  levels of competition  growth in the children s apparel market  our ability to meet our financing and working capital needs  the availability of suitable new store locations  the ability to develop and successfully source new merchandise  our success in updating our brand  our ability to rebuild our historic customer base  consumer acceptance of our products  our ability to capture satisfactory margins on our product sales  our success in planning and allocating store inventory levels  the ability to hire and train qualified sales associates  our success in creating merchandise displays that attract customers and encourage them to make purchases  the level of our investment in new concepts  the integration of our management team  and the ability to successfully identify and respond to emerging children s fashion trends and effectively monitor and control costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively realize our plans for future growth 
gymboree s sales and profitability depend upon our ability to rebuild demand by our customers for our products and services 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and fashion trends and upon the appeal of our products 
there can be no assurance that the demand for gymboree s apparel or accessories will be rebuilt or that we will be able to anticipate  gauge and respond to changes in fashion trends 
if demand for our apparel and accessories does not increase or if we were to misjudge fashion trends  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
gymboree s future profitability is critically dependent on our ability to achieve and manage potential future growth effectively 
there can be no assurance that gymboree will be successful in increasing net sales or gross profit in the future or that the rate of period to period net sales or gross profit growth  if any  will not continue to decline 
if our operations were to continue to grow  of which there can be no assurance  there could be increasing strain on other resources  and gymboree may experience serious operating difficulties  including difficulties in hiring  training  managing an increasing number of employees  difficulties in obtaining sufficient fabric and sourcing capacity to produce its products  problems in upgrading its management information systems and delays in product distribution shipments 
there can be no assurance that gymboree will be able to manage future growth effectively 
any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
gymboree has operations in europe and canada  which expanded in as a result  our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as foreign governmental regulations  foreign consumer preferences  currency fluctuations  political unrest  disruptions or delays in shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we operate our stores 
these factors  among others  could influence our ability to sell our products in these international markets 
if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  there could be a material and adverse effect on gymboree s results of operations and financial position 
during  gymboree opened stores under our new zutopia product line 
zutopia involves risk and uncertainties  including no prior operating history  no prior history of market acceptance  potentially higher expenses without corresponding revenue increases  impact to earnings  ability to obtain new store sites  ability to obtain adequate sources of merchandise  competition from other retailers and uncertainties generally associated with apparel retailing 
in addition  gymboree needs to support the production  merchandising and promotion of zutopia 
our limited experience with marketing apparel to this demographic segment could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop this product line 
gymboree is developing a strategy to handle the planned conversion in of the irish punt to the euro 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gymboree enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain inter company loans and inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies principally british pounds sterling  canadian dollars  and japanese yen 
the term of the forward exchange contracts is generally less than days 
the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflow resulting from the repayment of certain inter company loans from our foreign subsidiaries and the dollar net cash outflow resulting from inventory purchases will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts and fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts in us dollars as of january notional amount fair value in thousands british pounds sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen total  in the event gymboree has borrowings under the line of credit  a higher interest rate would have an adverse impact on gymboree because the interest rate is variable
