the credit lines required the company to comply with certain financial ratios and precluded the company from paying dividends and making acquisitions beyond certain limits without the bank s consent 
at december   the company was not in compliance with its minimum ebitda and minimum tangible net worth covenants  however  the bank has provided a written waiver for these covenants 
as noted above  the ex im guarantee was scheduled to expire on march  ex im bank s working capital guarantee program is designed to facilitate the expansion of us exports by helping small and medium sized businesses that have exporting potential but need funds to buy or produce goods or provide services for export 
the program is intended to help businesses for a limited time  until the businesses have grown their export trade enough to finance them without the ex im guarantees 
the company has benefited from this program since the company s inception in however  when the ex im guarantee was renewed in  gse was informed by ex im that the company was expected to graduate from the program when the current guarantee expired in an agreement could not be worked out with the company s bank to allow gse to continue its credit facility without the ex im guarantee  so the company negotiated a new loan and security agreement with another financial institution  which was entered into on march  borrowings from this facility were used to pay off the existing debt under the company s previous credit facility 
the new agreement established a million line of bank credit for the company and its subsidiaries  gse process solutions  inc and gse power systems  inc  jointly and severally as co borrowers

gp strategies provided a limited guarantee totaling million  mantech has provided a limited guarantee totaling  the loan and security agreement requires the company to comply with certain financial ratios and precludes the company from paying dividends and making acquisitions beyond certain limits without the bank s consent 
management believes that these covenants are attainable for the foreseeable future  based on existing budgets and forecasts 
in  in connection with the company s then existing credit facility  the company had arranged for certain guarantees to be provided on its behalf by gp strategies and mantech 
in consideration for these guarantees  the company granted each of mantech and gp strategies warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock  each of such warrants provides the right to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
in  the company recorded  as the estimated fair value of such warrants in the consolidated financial statements and amortized such value over the life of the initial guarantee  which expired in june during  the company recognized  of expense related to these warrants  in the company recognized  of expense 
the fair value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
assumptions used in the calculation were as follows dividend yield of  expected volatility of  risk free interest rates of and expected terms of years 
as of december   the company was contingently liable for three letters of credit totaling  two of the letters of credit represent payment bonds on contracts  while the remaining one was issued to the landlord of the company s previous facility whose lease was terminated in

these letters of credit could not be reissued by the company s new financial institution  and in june  the company was required to deposit funds with the issuing institution as collateral against the letters of credit 
on january   the company issued  shares of its common stock  at fair market value less discount  to mantech for  the proceeds of the stock issuance were used for working capital 
management believes that the company has sufficient liquidity and working capital resources necessary in for planned business operations  debt service requirements  planned investments and capital expenditures 
year as previously reported  beginning in  gse developed and implemented a plan to address the anticipated impacts of the year problem on the company s products and installed base and on its financial and administrative information technology systems 
the company also surveyed selected third parties to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
in addition  contingency plans were developed specifying what the company would do if it or important third parties experienced disruptions to critical business activities as a result of the year problem 
gse s year plan was completed in all material respects prior to the anticipated year failure dates 
as of march   the company has not experienced any materially important business disruptions or system failures as a result of year issues 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems that are not year compliant 
the company estimates that the aggregate costs to address the year issue totaled approximately million in the company believes that most of the customer related costs associated with the year issue would have occurred as part of its normal operations 
the company did not track these costs separately 
in  the company spent approximately  incremental to normal operating costs  on upgrades to its internal systems and outside consultant fees 
the company s policy is to expense as incurred information system maintenance costs and to capitalize the cost of new software and hardware and amortize or depreciate it over the assets useful lives 
foreign exchange 
a portion of the company s international sales revenue has been and may be received in a currency other than the currency in which the expenses relating to such revenue are paid 
when necessary  the company manages its foreign currency exposure primarily by entering into foreign currency exchange agreements and purchasing foreign currency options 
other matters 
to date  management believes inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse effects of differing tax structures 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in one entity are charged to other entities in different foreign jurisdictions 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of all foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the company is also subject to market risk related to the interest rates on its existing line of credit 
as of march   such interest rates are based on the prime rate
