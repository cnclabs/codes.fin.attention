item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are primarily engaged in the commercialization  research and development of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
in november  we received approval from the fda to market our first product  rituxan  in the united states  and in june  roche  our european marketing partner was granted marketing authorization for rituximab in all european union countries 
in september  zenyaku filed a bla for rituxan with the tokyo government and the ministry of health and welfare 
rituxan is the trade name in the united states and japan for the compound rituximab 
outside the united states and japan  rituximab is marketed as mabthera rituximab  rituxan and mabthera are collectively referred to as rituxan  except where otherwise indicated 
rituxan is being copromoted in the united states under a joint business arrangement with genentech  where we received a share of the pretax copromotion profits 
under the joint business arrangement we share responsibility with genentech for selling and continued development of rituxan in the united states 
continued development of rituxan includes conducting supportive research on rituxan and post approval clinical studies and obtaining potential approval of rituxan for additional indications 
genentech provides support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the united states including marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing and  as of september  genentech is responsible for all manufacturing responsibilities for rituxan 
under the terms of separate agreements with genentech  commercialization of rituxan outside the united states is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where zenyaku will be responsible for product development  marketing and sales 
we receive royalties on rituxan sales outside the united states 
our revenues include revenues from unconsolidated joint business  contract revenues and license fees 
until the commercialization of rituxan  a substantial portion of our revenues had been derived from contract revenues and license fees 
however  since the commercialization of rituxan in november  our revenues have depended primarily upon the sale of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our joint business arrangement with genentech  revenue from bulk rituxan sales to genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our sales force and development expenses and royalty income from roche on sales of rituximab outside the united states 
revenue from bulk rituxan sales is recognized when bulk rituxan is accepted by genentech 
we record our royalty income from roche with a one quarter lag 
under the joint business arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech  and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our collaborative agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the joint business arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profit at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets to the lower tier on an annual basis  at the beginning of each year 
we began recording our profit share at the upper tier during the second quarter of as compared to the third quarter in contract revenues include nonrefundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with our strategic partners and other funding under contractual arrangements with other parties 
contract research and development funding generally compensates us for discovery  preclinical and clinical expenses related to our collaborative development programs for certain of our products and is recognized at the time research and development activities are performed under the terms of the collaborative agreements 
license fees include nonrefundable fees from product development milestone payments  the sale of license rights to our proprietary gene expression technology and nonrefundable fees from the sale of product rights under collaborative development and license agreements with our strategic partners 
included in license fees are nonrefundable product development milestone payments which are recognized upon the achievement of product development milestone objectives as stipulated in agreements with our strategic partners 
product development milestone objectives vary in each of our agreements 
the achievement of product development milestone objectives that may lead to the recognition of license fees may include  but are not limited to the achievement of preclinical research and development objectives  the initiation of various phases of clinical trials  the filing of an ind  bla or nda  the filing of drug license applications in foreign territories  and obtaining united states and or foreign regulatory product approvals 
contract revenues and license fees may vary from period to period and are in part dependent upon achievement of certain research and development objectives or the consummation of new corporate alliances 
the magnitude and timing of contract revenues and license fees may influence our achievement and level of profitability 
the cost of bulk rituxan sold to genentech is recorded as manufacturing costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
under our agreement with genentech  the sales price of bulk rituxan sold to genentech is capped at a price that is less than our cost to manufacture bulk rituxan 
in september we transferred all manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech 
since the transfer of bulk rituxan manufacturing to genentech in september  we have begun using our remaining manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and potential commercial inventory of the zevalin antibody  and anticipate using our available manufacturing capacity for production of clinical material and potentially some third party contract manufacturing 
we have incurred increasing annual operating expenses and  with the commercialization of rituxan and preparation for potential commercialization of zevalin  we expect such trends to continue 
since our inception in  through  we incurred annual operating losses 
our ongoing profitability will be dependent upon the continued commercial success of rituxan  product development  revenues from the achievement of product development objectives and licensing transactions 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
results of operations revenues from unconsolidated joint business revenues from unconsolidated joint business in totaled million compared to million in and million in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in and reflect full year financial results from the commercialization of rituxan through our collaboration with genentech 
included in these revenues is our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our joint business arrangement with genentech  revenue from bulk rituxan sales to genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our sales force and development expenses and royalty income from roche on sales of rituximab outside the united states 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands copromotion profit loss    bulk rituxan sales    reimbursement of selling and development expenses    royalty income on sales of rituximab outside the us   we expect decreased revenues from bulk rituxan sales to genentech in subsequent periods due to the transfer of all manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech  as discussed above  and as the final lots of bulk rituxan manufactured by us during the third quarter of are accepted by genentech 
the sale of bulk rituxan for the year ended december  resulted in million of revenues  which offset a majority of manufacturing costs in going forward  our decision to transfer all manufacturing responsibilities to genentech will result in the loss of revenues to offset our manufacturing costs 
the loss of bulk rituxan revenues may be offset by the potential financial and development timeline benefits of manufacturing zevalin and other clinical antibodies in our manufacturing facility 
under our agreement with genentech  our pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we will earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets to the lower tier on an annual basis  at the beginning of each year 
we began recording our annual copromotion profits using the upper tier in the second quarter of as compared to the third quarter in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in consist of bulk rituxan sales to genentech and reimbursement from genentech for our rituxan sales force and development expenses  offset by our share of the joint business operating loss 
during  the joint business recorded an operating loss due to significant shared expenses related to the product launch of rituxan in the united sates in december rituxan net sales to third party customers in the united states by genentech in amounted to million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma and a six percent increase in the wholesale price of rituxan which was effected on october  in addition to us sales of rituxan  genentech recorded in and million and million  respectively  of ex us sales of rituximab that were shipped to its partner roche 
our royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us is based on roche s end user sales and is recorded with a one quarter lag 
in we recognized million in royalties from roche s end users sales compared to million in contract revenues contract revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in contract revenues in resulted primarily from decreased funding under collaborative agreements with eisai  seikagaku and smithkline beecham  offset by increased funding under a collaboration and license agreement with schering ag 
the increase in contract revenues in resulted primarily from increased funding under collaborative agreements with eisai that was offset in part by decreased research and development funding from genentech and seikagaku 
license fees license fees totaled million in compared to million in and million in license fees in consist primarily of a million up front licensing fee from shering ag for the development and commercialization of zevalin outside the united states 
license fees in consisted of a million product development milestone payment from genentech for european approval of rituxan  a million license fee from kirin for the license of our proprietary gene expression technology and a product development milestone payment for the ind allowance of idec  an investigational primatized anti b monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis  under our collaboration with mitsubishi 
license fees in are primarily due to a million product development milestone payment received from genentech upon fda approval of rituxan and a million license fee from boehringer for the license of our proprietary gene expression technology 
we continue to pursue other collaborative and license arrangements  however  no assurance can be given that any such arrangements will be realized 
manufacturing costs manufacturing costs totaled million in compared to million in and million in manufacturing costs for  and relate to production of bulk rituxan sold to genentech 
manufacturing costs are recognized when genentech accepts bulk rituxan inventory 
the decrease in manufacturing costs for is due to the completion in september of our obligation to manufacture bulk rituxan under our agreement with genentech 
in september we transferred all manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech which will result in decreased manufacturing costs in subsequent periods as the final lots of bulk rituxan manufactured by us during the third quarter of are accepted by genentech 
since the transfer of bulk rituxan to genentech  certain of our manufacturing efforts have been associated with clinical development and such manufacturing expenses will now be recorded as research and development expenses 
manufacturing costs in includes costs of approximately million incurred for the start up of our manufacturing facility 
research and development research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to increased personnel expenses and zevalin related clinical trials  process development and manufacturing scale up expenses  offset in part by decreased contract manufacturing by third parties and other outside service expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses in is due to a million up front licensing fee to pharmacia upjohn for exclusive rights to ac in partially offset by higher personnel and clinical trial expenses incurred during we expect to continue incurring substantial additional research and development expenses in the future  due to completion of our primary development program for zevalin and preparation of our zevelin bla package  the expansion or addition of research and development programs  technology in licensing  regulatory related expenses  preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development  and production scale up and manufacturing of products used in clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and due to increased sales and marketing expenses resulting from the commercialization of rituxan 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support sales and administration  our preparation for the potential commercialization of zevalin  expanded manufacturing capacity  expanded clinical trials  research and development and the potential expansion of our sales and marketing organization 
interest income expense interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in is primarily due to higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulting from the completion of a notes offering in february  see liquidity and capital resources  cash provided by operations and cash provided from the issuance of common stock issued under employee stock option and purchase plans 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to noncash interest charges relating to the notes offering in february the decrease in interest expense in is due to the repayment of notes payable 
interest expense is expected to increase in the future due to interest charges from the notes 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately five percent compared to two percent in our effective tax rate for resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and our effective tax rate for was the result of an alternative minimum tax system that only allows the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset of taxable income 
at december   we had a valuation allowance equal to our deferred tax assets of million since we have not established a pattern of profitable operations for income tax reporting purposes 
our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income at december  were approximately million for federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership in us of more than fifty percent in prior years 
however  we anticipate this annual limitation to only result in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  consisted of state franchise tax 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital expenditures since inception principally through the sale of equity securities  commercialization of rituxan  license fees  contract revenues  lease financing transactions  debt and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  funds from our joint business arrangement with genentech and with funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts which we believe will be sufficient to meet our near term operating requirements 
existing collaborative research agreements and contracts  however  could be canceled by the contracting parties 
in addition  we may  from time to time seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be obtained through these sources on acceptable terms  if at all 
should we not enter into any such arrangements  we anticipate our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  together with the existing agreements and contracts and cash generated from our joint business arrangement with genentech  will be sufficient to finance our currently anticipated needs for operating and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if adequate funds are not available from the joint business arrangement  operations or additional sources of financing  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of rituxan  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals  levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  technological advances  status of competitors  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
until required for operations we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale compared to million at december  sources of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december   included from the notes offering discussed below  million from operations and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
uses of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december   included million used to purchase capital equipment and million used to pay notes payable 
in february  we raised through the sale of notes approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses of million 
the notes were priced with a yield to maturity of percent annually 
upon maturity  the notes will have an aggregate principal face value of million 
each  aggregate principal face value note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
we are required under the terms of the notes  as of business days after a change in control occurring on or before february   to purchase any note at the option of its holder at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase 
additionally  the holders of the notes may require us to purchase the notes on february   or at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
we have the right to redeem the notes on or after february  in september  we entered into a development and license agreement with cytokine pharmasciences  inc  formally known as cytokine networks  inc  cpi 
under the terms of the development and license agreement with cpi  we may make payments to cpi totaling up to million  subject to attainment of certain product development milestone objectives  of which million has been paid through december  in july  we announced that we terminated our development of ac  following a phase ii clinical trial 
we concluded that ac would not yield the desired benefits to solid tumor cancer patients 
we originally acquired ac from pharmacia upjohn who developed it under collaboration with the nci 
we have returned all product rights for ac to the nci 
in october  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with smithkline beecham related to the development and commercialization of compounds based on our primatized anti cd antibodies 
in february  we amended and restated our agreement with smithkline beecham which resulted in all anti cd program rights  including idec  being returned to us 
we will receive no further funding from smithkline beecham under the restated agreement 
as part of the restated agreement  smithkline beecham has the option to negotiate commercialization and copromotion rights with us for the first compound based on our primatized anti cd antibodies to complete a phase ii study 
if we do not commercialize and copromote the compound with smithkline beecham  we will pay smithkline beecham royalties on sales by us  our affiliates and licensees on products emerging from the rights returned to us under the restated agreement 
additionally  we had future minimum lease payment obligations under our operating leases of million as of december  new accounting standard and accounting bulletin in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

sab no 
summarizes certain of the sec s staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides that specific facts and circumstances may result in nonrefundable fees received under our collaborative agreements not being recognized as revenue upon payment but instead recognized as revenue over future periods  which could extend beyond the initial contractual period 
there are many unanswered questions related to the application of sab no 
to biotechnology companies  including ours 
some of these questions have been forwarded to the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force for consideration 
we are presently evaluating the impact  if any  that sab no 
will have on our reported results 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 

statement no 
 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities with the instruments measured at fair value and is effective on january  the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
we do not believe the adoption of statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
year compliance our computer systems and equipment successfully transitioned to the year with no significant issues 
we continue to keep our year project management in place to monitor latent problems that could surface at key dates or events in the future 
it is not anticipated that there will be any significant problems related to these events 
all costs associated with the year remediation efforts were expensed or capitalized in accordance with appropriate accounting policies 
we continue to rely upon genentech to provide for all future year related remediation activities relating to the manufacture and sale of rituxan 
genentech reported in its annual report on form k for its year ended december  that they have not experienced any significant year related issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and the cost of our debt 
at december   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained a short term investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and to a lesser extent foreign and us government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december   would have resulted in approximately a million change in pretax income 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our long term debt totaled million at december  and was comprised principally of the notes 
our long term debt obligations bear interest at a weighed average interest rate of 
due to the fixed rate nature of the notes  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make conversion of the notes to common stock beneficial to the notes holder 
conversion of the notes would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and book value per common share
