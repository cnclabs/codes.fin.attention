overview the company develops  manufactures and markets immunoassay based test kits for rapid and inexpensive detection of a wide variety of substances in the agricultural  water quality and environmental market segments 
through its strategic biosolutions division  the company also provides antibody and immunoreagent research and development production services 
since its inception  the company and its predecessors have in addition to conducting internal research and development of new products  entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the water quality  environmental testing  agricultural and other markets 
these agreements generally provide that sales and marketing costs associated with a new product are borne by the corporate partner 
in addition  the company currently sells directly or through distributors other products that it has independently developed or acquired 
the company believes that its competitiveness has been enhanced through the combinations of talents  technology and resources resulting from the relationships and the acquisitions it concluded during the past four years 
these relationships and acquisitions have enabled the company to achieve meaningful economies of scale for the unique products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilites in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits  antibodies and biochemicals  its facility located outside of san diego  california for the manufacture of antibodies and biochemicals and its facility located in windham  maine for the manufacture of custom  high volume bulk polyclonal antibodies 
these economies of scale  in turn  enable the company to offer its customers the most appropriate test for each specific customer application 
another key strategy that the company used to develop its business was the formation in of tsd bioservices  a joint venture between the company and a subsidiary of taconic farms of germantown  ny 
taconic farms is a privately held company whose business is the production and sale of mice and rats  primarily to the research community 
in  the joint venture was dissolved and the company s interests were distributed into a wholly owned subsidiary  tsd bioservices  inc tsd 
with tsd and the acquisitions of hti and the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies  the company formed a new operating division  strategic biosolutions  which has now become one of the largest producers of antibodies in the united states 
the mission of strategic biosolutions is to supply monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as research institutions 
the company believes that its products in the agricultural  water quality and environmental testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success

results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in versus this increase is the result of a million or increase in product related revenues offset by a thousand or decrease in contract and other revenues 
the growth in product revenues is primarily attributable to increases in sales of products in the agricultural category  tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants as sales in this category of products grew from the levels achieved in  resulting from the expansion of the agricultural product line to include kits designed for the quality assurance of foundation seed and the launch of a product line designed for the food processing and grain industry 
included sales to distributors in the us  japan and parts of europe and south america 
increases in revenues of antibody products grew from the levels  due primarily to the inclusion of revenues from the hti acquisition in february of  and the acquisition of the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies in may of  for which there were no comparable revenues

these increases were partially offset by decreases in the industrial chemical category thousand  and water quality category million  when compared to the revenues recorded in these categories 
the decline in contract and other revenues is the result of the company s focusing its efforts on the food testing market during the second half of during the second half of  the company strategically refocused its efforts and devoted significant resources to enter the european market for food testing to detect the presence of genetically modified organisms gmos in agricultural commodities and food fractions that are used to manufacture finished food products 
this focus resulted in a reduction in contract and other revenues and an increase in research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million in  from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to an increase in the general business activity that occurred during the year and is described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the costs of products sold  increased thousand in to million

during  the company began to market certain products in the agricultural products category through independent distributors 
future sales through these additional distribution channels could be substantial but difficult to predict from quarter to quarter  and the terms for payment of these types of sales are somewhat extended from the company s typical payment terms for direct sales and will continue to evolve as business needs dictate 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash available and on hand  and from a financing agreement with a commercial bank for million in acquisition financing for the purchase of hti and the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies 
at december   the company had million in long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
the company believes it has  or has access to sufficient assets to meet its operating requirements for the forseeable future
