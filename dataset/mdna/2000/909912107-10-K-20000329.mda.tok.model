liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was approximately million 
management continues to believe that the real estate market is overvalued and accordingly recent acquisitions have been limited to those select properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that the available working capital along with the million of availability on the revolving credit facility discussed below  puts it in an opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio as attractive long term opportunities become available 
the current liabilities of the company have historically exceeded its current assets principally due to the financing of the purchase of long term assets utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgage obligations without the corresponding current asset for such properties 
future financial statements may reflect current liabilities in excess of current assets 
management is confident that through cash flow generated from operations  together with borrowings available under the revolving credit facility discussed below and the sale of select assets  all obligations will be satisfied as they come due 
the company s portfolio of available for sale securities had a fair market value of approximately million at december   reflecting pretax unrealized holding gains of approximately million 
effective december   the company entered into a credit agreement with three banks which provides for both a million revolving credit facility revolver and a million term loan term loan 
each of the three banks participates in the revolver while only one of the banks is a participant in the term loan 
under the terms of the revolver  the company will be provided with eligibility based upon the sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of unencumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at  ii the lesser of million or of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of unencumbered eligible hotel properties  as defined  capitalized at  iii the lesser of million or of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of encumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at and iv the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
at december   eligibility under the revolver was million  based upon the above terms 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  including minimum consolidated equity  interest coverage  debt service coverage and capital expenditures other than for real estate 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the credit agreement also contains provisions which allow the banks to perfect a security interest in certain operating and real estate assets in the event of a default  as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolver  at the company s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate prime or at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the revolver expires on december  at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
the term loan bears interest at day libor plus at december  and is payable in quarterly principal installments of  with the final payment due on september  at december   there was million outstanding on the term loan 
prior to obtaining the revolver and term loan  the company maintained a credit agreement with two banks which provided for both a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
this credit agreement was terminated effective december  in conjunction with the execution of the new revolver and term loan 
the termination included the retirement of million under the term loan to a bank that is not participating in the current facility 
the remaining term loan balance of million was converted to the term loan under arrangements similar to the original facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term loan 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement the swap to effectively convert its floating rate term loan to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future expense 
under the swap  the company agreed to exchange with the counterparty a commercial bank the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
the differential to be paid or received on the swap is recognized over the term of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap is not recognized in the financial statements 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has filed an action against certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred in these matters 
at december   settlements have been reached with all but one carrier in this matter

in august  the company s board of directors authorized a dutch auction self tender offer for up to  shares of the company s common stock  or approximately of its outstanding shares 
under the terms of this offer  which expired on september   the company invited shareholders to tender shares at prices between and per share 
in october  the company purchased and retired approximately  shares validly tendered at a price of per share 
the million of shares repurchased in connection with this self tender offer represented approximately of the company s outstanding shares at that time 
as a result of the repurchase  the company s additional paid in capital was reduced to zero and the company s retained earnings was reduced by approximately million 
future repurchases of the company s common stock will also reduce retained earnings by amounts in excess of the par value 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that future operational cash needs and the cash required to repurchase the company s common stock will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  ongoing operations and additional borrowings under the revolver 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans will come from existing funds  additional borrowings under the revolver  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
funds of the company in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
market risk the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general levels of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company s available for sale securities consist of us investments in both common and preferred equity issues as well as corporate debt securities and are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and self amortizing from the net cash flow on the underlying properties 
the company s term loan has a variable rate but is effectively hedged by an interest rate swap agreement  whose notional amount matches the principal balance of the variable rate debt it hedges 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as the european  south american and asian markets 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and the company s operating results are not materially exposed to changes in exchange rates 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commodities principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
global competition has stabilized or reduced prices in the key metals used in the company s manufacturing processes 
while key metals purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact materials pricing 
the company is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  it does enter into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally do not exceed twelve months and tend to minimize short term currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results  however  could be significantly affected by fluctuations in metals pricing 
certain raw materials used by the company have been the subject of international trade disputes regarding price dumping in the united states 
although management does not expect such matters to adversely effect the company s financial position  an unfavorable outcome could result in higher raw material costs and adversely effect the company s results of operations

this increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues from the accounting treatment of certain property leases resulting in the recognition of non recurring revenues in the fourth quarter and also from revenues associated with properties acquired in offset by lower sales in the engineered products segment 
income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in this increase is principally due to the results of the company s real estate operations  partially offset by reduced operating profit in the engineered products segment resulting from the reduction in revenues and amounts invested to expand the company s product offerings and improve competitiveness 
the results of the company s real estate operations reflect an increase in operating income of million on a revenue increase of million 
the increase in operating profits is primarily due to the revenue increase discussed above and lower depreciation expense associated with properties sold in and offset by increases in other real estate operating expenses 
continuing lease renewals and mortgage amortization will continue to have a positive effect upon the revenues and operating profit of this segment 
where appropriate  management may use permanent long term financing rather than its short term revolving credit facility to finance its real estate acquisitions 
the company s engineered products segment posted a decrease in revenues during the twelve months ended december   from the comparable period 
the modest decrease in net sales reflects the continued price competition within the worldwide automotive industry 
management is aggressively pursuing new sales opportunities including new geographical markets for its existing products and new applications for its core technologies 
year conversion the company has taken reasonable steps in preparing for the year issue 
the costs directly associated with year compliance were not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
although the company believes that it successfully avoided any significant disruption from the year issue  it will continue to monitor all critical systems for the appearance of latent year disruptions and problems encountered through third parties with whom the company deals to ensure that such matters get addressed promptly 
any resulting disruption could have a material adverse impact on its business
