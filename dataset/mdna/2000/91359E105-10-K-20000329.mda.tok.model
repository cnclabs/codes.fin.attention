the trust has entered into interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement which are designed to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate revolving credit notes 
at december   the trust had five outstanding swap agreements for notional principal amounts of  which mature from may  through november  these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on  of variable rate debt at including the revolver spread of

the trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements 
these counterparties are major financial institutions and the trust does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties which are rated a or better by moody s investors service

results of operations total revenues increased or  to million in as compared to and or  to million in as compared to million in the  increase during over was due primarily to a  increase in base rentals from non related parties and a  increase in interest income 
the  increase in base rentals from non related parties resulted primarily from i revenues generated from the sheffield medical building and the orthopaedic specialists of nevada building  both of which were acquired during the fourth quarter of  and  ii a  increase in the base rentals of tri state rehabilitation hospital resulting from the june  lease amendment which increased the minimum rent and eliminated the additional rent provision 
the  increase in interest income is primarily due to the interest earned on short term loans advanced to three separate llcs in which the trust has ownership interests  all of which were repaid to the trust by june  the  increase during over was due primarily to a  increase in base rentals from non related parties due primarily to the completion of the cypresswood professional center during the third quarter of  and a  increase in bonus rental income from uhs facilities 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a  decrease in interest income due to a mortgage loan receivable which was fully repaid in june  and a construction loan receivable which was repaid in december  the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors 
a continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon the future operating performance of the trust s hospital facilities 
the trust s hospital facilities have experienced growth in outpatient utilization over the past several years 
the increase in outpatient services is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  managed care companies and other insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states as well as the trust s hospital facilities continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects the increased competition  admission constraints and payor pressures to continue 
the ability of the trust s hospital facilities to maintain or grow their net revenues and operating margins is dependent upon their ability to successfully respond to these trends as well as reductions in spending on governmental healthcare programs 
the medicare program reimburses the operators of the trust s hospitals primarily based on established rates by a diagnosis related group drg for acute care hospitals and by cost based formula for behavioral health facilities 
historically  rates paid under medicare s prospective payment system pps for inpatient services have increased  however  these increases have been less than cost increases 
pursuant to the terms of the balanced budget act of bba  there were no increases in the rates paid to hospitals for inpatient care through september  and reimbursement for bad debt expense and capital costs as well as other items have been reduced 
inpatient operating payment rates increased for the period of october  through september   however  the modest rate increase was less than inflation and was more than offset by the negative impact of converting reimbursement on skilled nursing facility patients from a cost based reimbursement to a prospective payment system and from lower drg payments on certain patient transfers mandated by bba inpatient operating payment rates were increased for the period of october  through september   however  the modest increase was less than inflation and is expected to be more than offset by the negative impact of increasing the qualification threshold for additional payments for treating costly inpatient cases outliers 
payments for medicare outpatient services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain adjustments and limits 
bba requires that payment for those services be converted to prospective payment systems pps 
the health care financing administration s current plan is to implement pps for outpatients by july   however  there is a possibility that outpatient pps may be delayed until january  since final provisions of the outpatient medicare pps are not yet available  the operators of the trust s facilities can not completely estimate the resulting impact on their future results of operations 
the trust expects continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit healthcare spending could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the trust s facilities and the healthcare industry 
in addition to the medicare and medicaid programs  other payors continue to actively negotiate the amounts they will pay for services performed 
in general  the operators of the trust s facilities expect to continue to experience an increase in business from managed care programs  including hmos and ppos 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
interest expense increased  or in as compared to and  or in as compared to due primarily to the additional borrowings used to finance the  and investments described in note of the financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased slightly in as compared to and increased  or in as compared to the increase in as compared to was due primarily to the depreciation expense related to the acquisitions described in note other operating expenses decreased  or in as compared to primarily due to a favorable expense reserve adjustment recorded in the third quarter of  relating to lakeshore hospital  which was sold during the third quarter of for net cash proceeds of  other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due to the operating expenses on the cypresswood professional center on which construction was completed during the third quarter of and an increase in various other operating expenses 
included in the trusts other operating expenses were the expenses related to the medical office buildings  in which the trust has a controlling ownership interest which totaled million in  million in and  in the majority of these expenses are passed on directly to the tenants and are included as revenues in the trust s statements of income 
during  the operating performance declined significantly at one of the trust s behavioral health services facilities operated by  and leased to  a wholly owned subsidiary of uhs 
changes in champus utilization and the increasing influence of managed care have led to shorter lengths of stay for patients at this facility which is operated as an adolescent residential treatment center 
during the twelve months ended december  patient days and average length of stay at this facility decreased and  respectively  as compared to the comparable prior year period 
in the twelve month period ended december   this facility had earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and base rental expense ebitdar of times the annual rent payable to the trust 
the lease on this facility expires in december  and represented of the trust s rental revenue for the twelve month period ended december  although management of the trust is actively negotiating the sale lease of the property with uhs as well as non related parties  management of the trust has concluded that  based on an analysis of future cash flows  there has been a permanent impairment in the carrying value of this facility 
as a result  the trust recorded a million provision for investment loss during also during  the trust sold the real estate assets of lakeshore hospital for net proceeds of  since the book value of this facility had previously been reduced to zero  this amount was recorded as a gain and netted against the provision for investment loss during included in the trust s financial results was million in  million in and  in  of income generated from the trust s ownership in limited liability companies which own medical office buildings in arizona  california  kentucky  new mexico and nevada note of the financial statements 
net income for was million or per basic and diluted share compared to million or per basic and diluted share in and million or per basic and diluted share in funds from operations ffo  which is the sum of net income plus depreciation expense for consolidated investments and unconsolidated investments and amortization of interest rate cap expense  totaled million in  million in and million in ffo may not be calculated in the same manner for all companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
general during  the lease on tri state rehabilitation hospital was amended and renewed for a five year term commencing on june  and ending on may  pursuant to the terms of the lease as amended  the minimum rent has been increased and the additional rent provision has been eliminated 
during the third quarter of  wholly owned subsidiaries of uhs exercised five year renewal options on four hospitals owned by the trust which were scheduled to expire in through virtue street pavilion  the bridgeway  inland valley regional medical center and wellington regional medical center 
the leases on these facilities were renewed at the same lease rates and terms as the initial leases 
as part of the renewal agreement  the trust also agreed to grant additional fixed rate renewal options to a wholly owned subsidiary of uhs commencing in on the real property of mcallen medical center 
management of the trust can not predict whether the leases with subsidiaries of uhs  which have renewal options at existing lease rates  or any of the trust s other leases  will be renewed at the end of their initial term or first five year renewal term 
the trust did not experience any significant year computer related issues as a result of the turn of the century 
market risks associated with financial instruments the trust s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of the trust s debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require the trust to pay a fixed and receive a floating interest rate over the life of the agreements 
the floating rates are based on libor and the fixed rates are determined upon consummation of the swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
the trust does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the trust is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to its financial instruments 
the counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions  rated a or better by moody s investor services and the trust anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts
