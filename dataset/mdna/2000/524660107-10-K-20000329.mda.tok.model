item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
capital resources and liquidity the company s financial position reflects management s capital policy guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to ensure that corporate liquidity is adequate to support the company s projected growth rate 
also  liquidity is necessary to finance the company s ongoing operations in periods of economic downturn 
in a normal operating environment  management intends to direct capital to ongoing operations  strategic acquisitions and other investments that provide opportunities for expansion and enhanced profitability 
the expansion of capital resources debt and equity is planned to allow the company to take advantage of favorable capital market conditions  rather than respond to short term needs 
such financial flexibility is considered more important than short term maximization of earnings per share through excessive leverage 
therefore  management continuously provides for available credit in excess of near term projected cash needs and has maintained a guideline for long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization in a range of to 
total capitalization the following table shows the company s total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years 
also  the table shows the amount of unused committed credit available through the company s revolving bank credit agreements and the amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities shareholders equity    total capitalization    unused committed credit cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively  or a three year total of  million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities principally reflects earnings improvements  offset somewhat by higher working capital requirements 
long term debt outstanding was of total capitalization at the end of and at the end of both and as shown in the table above  obligations having scheduled maturities are the base layer of the company s debt capital 
at the end of  these obligations consisted primarily of the company s privately placed medium term notes and tax exempt industrial development bonds 
in the second and third quarters of  the company issued a total of million in medium term notes 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay maturing notes and for acquisitions 
in november  the company completed a million shelf registration of debt  the proceeds of which will be used for working capital additions  capital expenditures  stock redemption  debt repayment or financing for acquisitions 
in february  million of five year notes were issued under the shelf registration 
these notes were converted to variable rate notes under an interest rate swap agreement 
in the first and second quarters of  the company issued a total of million in medium term notes 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay commercial paper outstanding and to provide financing for acquisitions 
a portion of the proceeds were temporarily held in cash and cash equivalents at december  in the second quarter of  the company issued million of medium term notes to repay commercial paper outstanding 
the second layer of the company s debt capital consists of revolving bank credit agreements and commercial paper issuances 
management has negotiated bank credit agreements and established a commercial paper program to continuously support the company s projected growth and to maintain highly flexible sources of debt capital 
the majority of the credit under these arrangements is a long term obligation 
if needed  however  the credit is available for short term borrowings and repayments 
the long term portion of the company s revolving credit agreements was million at december   and was increased to million in january at the end of  the company had million of commercial paper outstanding 
additional details of long term debt  including scheduled maturities  revolving credit and commercial paper are discussed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of capital resources the company s internal investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled million in the last three years 
in  management anticipates internal investments will approximate million 
during the last three years  the company employed million in cash net of cash acquired and issued million shares of common stock in acquisitions 
during  twenty nine businesses were acquired for million in cash net of cash acquired and million shares of common stock 
in addition  the company assumed of acquisition companies debt 
about one half of the acquisition investments cash and stock were made in commercial furnishings and about were made in residential furnishings 
additional details of acquisitions are discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additions  by segment  to property  plant and equipment and purchases of long lived assets are shown in note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
company purchases of its common stock totaled million in  million in  and million in these purchases were made primarily for employee stock plans  to replace shares issued in purchase acquisitions and to satisfy contractual obligations 
in mid  the company s board of directors authorized management  at its discretion  to buy up to  shares of leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans 
the authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued for these benefit plans 
in addition  management is authorized  again at its discretion  to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
in february  the board of directors increased this authorization to  shares 
cash dividends on the company s common stock in the last three years totaled million 
over this three year period  cash dividends per share have increased at a compounded annual rate 
as a percent of earnings per share diluted  cash dividends per share were in  in and in future commitments under lease obligations are described in note f and contingencies are discussed in note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
short term liquidity working capital  including working capital from acquired companies  increased million in the last three years 
to gain additional flexibility in capital management and to improve the return on shareholders equity  the company continuously seeks efficient use of working capital 
the following table shows the annual turnover on average year end working capital  trade receivables and inventories 
inventory levels at the end of reflect an unusual amount of purchases made in anticipation of higher prices for certain key raw materials 
also  the ratios may be affected by the timing of the company s acquisitions 
working capital turnover excluding cash and cash equivalents x x x trade receivables turnover inventory turnover no segment s working capital requirements vary significantly from the consolidated ratios  except aluminum products 
aluminum products receivables turnover is lower than the other segments due principally to the seasonal nature of its gas barbecue grill business 
also  aluminum commitments to certain customers result in carrying higher levels of inventory than the company s other segments 
results of operations discussion of consolidated results the results of operations during the last three years reflect various elements of the company s long term growth strategy  along with general economic trends and the specific market conditions 
the company s growth strategy continues to include internal initiatives and acquisitions which provide for increased market penetration and operating efficiencies and broaden product lines 
with a continuing emphasis on the development of new and improved products and advancements in production technologies  the company is able to consistently offer high quality products  competitively priced 
trends in the general economy were very favorable during the last three years 
in each year  acquisitions accounted for more of the company s sales growth than other factors 
the balance of the company s sales growth during this period primarily reflected increases in unit volumes  although was also impacted by lower selling prices for certain products 
aluminum and certain product lines in residential furnishings and industrial materials experienced selling price declines in residential furnishings accounted for of the increase in consolidated sales  and commercial furnishings accounted for of the increase 
in  residential furnishings accounted for of the consolidated sales increase over and commercial furnishings accounted for of the increase 
the following table shows various measures of earnings as a percentage of sales for the last three years 
it also shows the effective income tax rate and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
gross profit margin ebit earnings before interest and taxes margin net profit margin effective income tax rate ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x the company s gross profit margins improved in each of the last two years 
the increase in reflected several favorable factors 
these included continued increases in production efficiencies  increased sales of products with above average margins  lower material costs and better manufacturing overhead absorption 
the ebit margin also increased due to these factors  offset somewhat by higher operating costs as a percentage of sales 
the higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales  which include some amount of fixed administrative and other costs  was impacted by the effect on sales of lower selling prices in certain product lines and higher operating costs in acquired companies as a percentage of sales 
the increase in the gross profit and ebit margins versus also reflected the company s continuing sales growth in products with above average margins  increased production efficiencies  lower material costs and better manufacturing overhead absorption 
seasonality the percent of consolidated net sales by quarter  excluding the impact of acquisitions  is as follows for the last three years first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the company does not experience significant seasonality  however  as indicated in the above table  quarter to quarter sales can vary in proportion to the total year by 
management estimates that this sales impact can have  at current average net margins and considering overhead absorption  an approximately plus or minus impact on quarter to quarter net earnings 
the timing of acquisitions in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of the company s businesses 
for the company s businesses in total  the second and third quarters have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are lower 
over the last three years  this small seasonality has become somewhat more pronounced  with the fourth quarter showing proportionately lower sales due to the growth of the store fixtures business of commercial furnishings 
residential furnishings and commercial furnishings typically have their strongest sales in the second and third calendar quarters 
commercial furnishings particularly has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products  with the first and fourth quarters significantly lower 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to gas barbecue grill castings 
industrial materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from wire products used for baling cotton 
specialized products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the first two quarters of the year  and somewhat lower in the third quarter  due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
discussion of segment results a description of the products included in each segment  segment sales  segment earnings before interest and taxes ebit and other segment data appear in note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
following is a comparison of ebit margins segment ebit divided by total segment sales residential furnishings commercial furnishings aluminum products industrial materials specialized products residential furnishings sales increased in  principally from acquisitions  although volume growth was also a significant factor 
the growth in sales was negatively impacted by declining selling prices in certain product lines 
ebit increased in versus  and ebit margin increased slightly as higher volume improved operating efficiencies and raw material costs were lower 
for  residential furnishings sales were up due primarily to acquisitions 
ebit improved in by  and ebit margin improved slightly 
operating efficiencies and lower raw material costs improved ebit margins 
commercial furnishings sales in increased over the prior year due primarily to acquisition activity 
ebit improved in  but ebit margin declined due to product mix  lower volume in certain product lines and the fact that the company has not yet fully realized the integration benefits of the substantial acquisition activity in this segment 
in  commercial furnishings sales improved  principally from significant acquisition activity 
ebit in was higher than  but ebit margin declined somewhat 
product mix and integration issues related to new acquisitions impacted ebit margin 
in  aluminum product sales increased  principally from improved operations 
this improvement was moderated by declining aluminum prices 
ebit increased and ebit margin improved from gains in operating efficiency and a shift to higher margin products at certain die cast facilities 
aluminum products sales in improved over  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
ebit declined and ebit margin was reduced as the impact of acquisitions was more than offset by a major die cast customer s restructuring and inventory reduction activities  reduced smelting production as a result of low scrap prices  and production inefficiencies in certain die cast facilities 
in  industrial materials sales were higher than  principally reflecting acquisition related sales 
the sales improvement was lower than unit volume gains as selling prices declined for drawn wire 
ebit improved in and ebit margin was better reflecting lower raw material prices and improved operating efficiencies 
industrial materials sales in increased over  primarily from acquisitions 
ebit improved in  and ebit margins were higher due to production efficiencies  better overhead absorption and lower raw material prices 
specialized products sales increased in due primarily to acquisitions 
ebit improved  reflecting acquisition growth and higher automotive sales 
ebit margin was up somewhat from improved efficiencies and acquisitions 
in  specialized products sales increased reflecting acquisitions

new financial accounting standards board statements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb no 

this new accounting standard will become effective for financial reporting 
fasb no 
is not expected to have a major effect on the company s financial statements since the company has not engaged in significant hedging or other activities involving derivative instruments in the past 
year disclosure the year issue refers to older computer programs that used only two digits to represent the year  rather than four digits 
as a result  these older computer programs may not process information or otherwise function properly when using the year  since that year will be indistinguishable from the year 
these computer programs are found in information processing applications and in timing devices for certain machinery and equipment 
to monitor year issues  the company implemented a corporate level year steering committee the steering committee 
the steering committee met regularly to review the company s progress  and to consider other actions that may be necessary for year issues 
the company recognized the year issue several years ago  and had been working since to correct this problem in its computer systems and manufacturing equipment 
as a result of these multi year efforts  the company experienced no disruption of its operations following the year rollover 
none of the company s major customers or suppliers reported experiencing any significant problems with year issues 
since the company has been working on year issues for several years  the costs of mitigating these issues  which costs have not been material in the past  were expensed in ongoing operations 
no material costs are expected from any remaining efforts 
costs of all the company s system conversion and implementation efforts  which include those efforts related to the year issue  were less than million in these system conversion and implementation costs are considered by management to be primarily recurring costs to remain technologically competitive  and no significant reduction is expected in these costs in the future as the company pursues e commerce and other initiatives 
it is not practical to segregate past or anticipated capital expenditures between year compliance and expenditures which occur normally to keep operations technologically competitive 
however  management believes that capital requirements related to year compliance issues were not significant to its operations
