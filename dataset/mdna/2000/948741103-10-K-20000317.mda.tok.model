wri currently has several other facilities under development  including seven retail centers  an industrial office service center and three additional retail centers in joint ventures with our denver based development partner 
the projects under construction or completed in represent an estimated investment by wri of approximately million and will add

additionally  wri has an ongoing program for maintaining and renovating its existing portfolio of properties 
capitalized expenditures for acquisitions  new development and additions to the existing portfolio were  in millions   and during  and  respectively 
all of the acquisitions and new development during were either initially financed under wri s revolving credit facility  funded with excess cash balances or funded with excess cash flow from our existing portfolio of properties 
in january  we issued million of series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares with a liquidation preference of per share and no stated maturity 
we can elect to redeem these shares anytime after march  the series c preferred shares are redeemable by the holder only upon their death and are also redeemable in either cash or common shares at wri s option 
there are limitations on the number of shares per shareholder and in the aggregate that may be redeemed per year 
the proceeds of this offering were used to pay down all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and retire million of variable rate  unsecured medium term notes  resulting in an extraordinary loss of 
million 
any redemption of preferred shares initiated by wri must be funded with proceeds from an offering of additional common or preferred shares 
in july  wri issued million of ten year fixed rate  unsecured medium term notes 
including the effect of a loss of million on the sale of treasury locks  which were designated as a hedge against future issuance of fixed rate notes  the effective interest rate is 
in january  wri issued million of ten year fixed rate  unsecured medium term notes 
in connection with this debt issuance  we entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to swap fixed rate interest for floating rate interest 
wri has a million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in november of wri has an annual option to request a one year extension of the commitment 
upon expiration  we have an option to convert amounts outstanding under the facility to a term loan payable over a two year period 
additionally  wri has an unsecured and uncommitted overnight credit facility totaling million to be used for cash management purposes 
wri will maintain adequate funds available under the million revolving credit facility at all times to cover the outstanding balance under the million facility 
wri has three interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million which fix interest rates on variable rate debt at and expire through subsequent to year end  wri finalized an additional million revolving credit agreement with a major bank 
this one year facility became effective on march  and is renewable at our option for an additional two year period 
we also filed a new million shelf registration statement in august of this year  all of which was available at year end 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily to fund acquisitions and new development 
wri will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider its available alternatives  including both public and private placements 
funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of wri s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in these increases relate primarily to the impact of wri s acquisitions  new developments and activity at its existing properties 
for further information on changes between years  see results of operations below 
results of operations rental revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in and by  or million  from million in of these increases  property acquisitions and new development contributed million in and million in the remaining portion of these increases is due to activity at our existing properties 
occupancy of our shopping centers  industrial properties and total portfolio decreased to at december  from at the end of this is primarily the result of the loss of certain large tenants in the latter half of the year 
among the larger losses were builders square  which occupied a  square foot space in corpus christi  texas  a  square foot kmart in houston  texas  a  square foot service merchandise in lake charles  louisiana and a  square foot pay save in lubbock  texas 
in  we completed renewals or new leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of the amortized portion of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged 
occupancy of our total portfolio increased to at december  from at the end of in  we completed renewals or new leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of the amortized portion of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged 
interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in income in is due to the funding of loans to our joint venture partners 
the decrease from to was due to the sale of million of marketable debt securities during the first quarter of equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled 
million in  
million in and million in the decrease in and is due to the purchase at december  of our joint venture partner s interest in four shopping centers and the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in a shopping center in july direct costs and expenses of operating our properties ie  operating and ad valorem tax expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during these periods 
overall  direct operating costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues were in  in and in depreciation and amortization have increased to million in from million in and million in  also as a result of the properties acquired and developed during these periods 
general and administrative expense has increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in results primarily from the adoption of a new emerging issues task force consensus decision which required that internal costs of identifying and acquiring operating property incurred subsequent to march  be expensed 
wri realized an increase in expense of million in due to the adoption of this standard 
the remainder of the increase in and the majority of the increase in are due to normal compensation increases as well as slight increases in staffing 
gross interest costs  before capitalization of interest to development projects  increased from million in to million in this increase in interest cost was due mainly to an increase in the average debt outstanding from million for to million for the weighted average interest rate increased from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  decreased 
million from the amount of interest capitalized increased to million in from million in due to an increase in the amount of development activity during the year 
comparing to  gross interest costs increased from million in to million in this was due to an increase in the average debt outstanding from million in to million in the weighted average interest rate decreased between the two periods from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million from the amount of interest capitalized increased by 
million in due to an increase in the amount of development activity during the year 
included in interest expense during was 
million related to repurchase agreements collateralized by our investment in marketable debt securities which were sold during the first quarter of the gain on sale of million in was due primarily to the sale of acres of undeveloped land and an interest in certain industrial properties to american national insurance company 
effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure the instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends upon its intended use 
wri will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal year wri is still evaluating the effects of adopting this statement  however  we do not expect the impact to be material to our operating results or our financial position 
in december  the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements was issued 
this bulletin requires that revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales be recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
implementation of this bulletin is expected to reduce revenue by 
million in year based on a review of our mission critical and non mission critical software and hardware  we concluded that our company s systems were year compliant 
no significant problems related to the year were experienced or are expected in the future 
our major tenants  financial institutions and utility companies represented to us that they also were year compliant 
while we have not been affected by any year issues experienced by these third parties  we have no guarantee that these third party systems will continue to operate as represented 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting wri s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk wri uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose wri to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
during  we entered into and settled three forward treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of million as a hedge against potential changes in interest rates of prospective issuances of fixed rate debt 
amounts paid or received upon settlement of these contracts are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the fixed rate debt 
at december   wri had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
we also had variable rate notes receivable totaling million at year end 
in the event that interest rates were to increase basis points  the fair value of fixed rate debt would decrease by million and net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease 
million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december
