the company derives net revenues by providing services pursuant to long term service agreements or consulting agreements collectively  management agreements with allied practices 
the company provides management or consulting services to each allied practice and assumes substantially all operating expenses except for compensation to the allied orthodontists and other employees that the company cannot employ according to applicable state laws 
in exchange for assuming these expenses and providing services  the company records revenues in amounts equal to the assumed expenses plus a service fee or consulting fee  as described below 
in general  the management agreements provide for the recognition of fees to the company based on a negotiated percentage of the adjusted patient revenue of allied practices 
the timing of the payment of such service fees is based upon cash collected 
adjusted patient revenue is net patient revenue  as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  including certain accrual adjustments  including those related to patient prepayments  and adjustments for contractual allowances and other discounts  plus an adjustment for uncollectible accounts 
patient revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for orthodontic services  approximately of the orthodontic contract revenues are recognized at the time of initial treatment 
the balance of the contract revenue is realized evenly over the remaining treatment period 
the estimated revenue at the initial treatment date is based on the estimated costs incurred by the practice at that time as compared to the total costs of providing the contracted services and is consistent with industry standards 
the percentage includes the estimated costs of diagnosis and treatment plan development  initial treatment by orthodontic personnel  orthodontic supplies  and associated administrative services 
net revenues also include the amortization of patient prepayments that were originally recorded at the affiliation date of the respective allied practice

ii a designated percentage of adjusted patient revenue  ranging from to  subject to an annual adjustment based upon improvements in the allied practice s operating margin in the most recent calendar year as compared with the immediately preceding calendar year 
no annual adjustment will be made which would result in reducing the designated percentage below the percentage applicable during the first year of the management agreement 
operating margin is defined as the percentage determined by dividing operating profit by adjusted patient revenue 
operating profit is equal to adjusted patient revenue less operating expenses  excluding the management fee and such expenses associated with the allied practices which the company is prohibited from incurring  primarily consisting of orthodontist compensation 
the average designated percentage is for the allied practices subject to this fee structure 
iii a fixed dollar fee with annual fixed dollar increases for each year of the term of the management agreement 
the company has entered into agreements with certain allied practices to make the payment of service fees after the first two years contingent on various factors  including practice profitability compared to acquisition consideration  timely reporting of information  participation in practice improvement programs and orthodontist hours worked 
expenses reported by the company include certain of the expenses to operate the orthodontic or pediatric dental offices and all of the expenses of any corporate offices  facilities or functions 
therefore  salaries and benefits include the wages  benefits  taxes or other employment costs for all employees of the company  including practice office staff  business office staff and management personnel 
rent includes facility expenses for both practice offices and corporate offices 
general and administrative expenses include professional services  such as legal and accounting  utilities  advertising  marketing  insurance  telephone  license fees  office supplies and shipping expenses 
advertising and marketing costs  which are included in general and administration costs  includes practice activities to attract new patients and corporate activities to attract new orthodontists or pediatric dentists to join the company 
practice supplies include only those expenses required by the allied orthodontists to provide treatment to patients
