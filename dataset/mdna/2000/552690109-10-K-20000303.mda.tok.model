system supply and system demand through an interconnected electric system  montana dakota serves markets in portions of the following states and major communities western north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson and williston  eastern montana  including glendive and miles city  and northern south dakota  including mobridge 
the interconnected system consists of seven on line electric generating stations which have an aggregate turbine nameplate rating attributable to montana dakota s interest of  kilowatts kw and a total summer net capability of  kw 
montana dakota s four principal generating stations are steam turbine generating units using coal for fuel 
the nameplate rating for montana dakota s ownership interest in these four stations including interests in the big stone station and the coyote station aggregating percent and percent  respectively is  kw 
the balance of montana dakota s interconnected system electric generating capability is supplied by three combustion turbine peaking stations 
additionally  montana dakota has contracted to purchase through october    kw of participation power from basin electric power cooperative for its interconnected system

virtually all of the current fuel requirements of the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations are met with coal supplied by knife river under various long term contracts 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the resolution of a suit and arbitration filed by the co owners of the coyote station against knife river and the company 
the majority of the big stone station s fuel requirements are currently being met with coal supplied by kennecott energy company under a contract which expires on december  during the years ended december   through december   the average cost of coal consumed  including freight  per million british thermal units btu at montana dakota s electric generating stations including the big stone and coyote stations in the interconnected system and the average cost per ton  including freight  of the coal so consumed was as follows years ended december  average cost of coal per million btu 




average cost of coal per ton the maximum electric peak demand experienced to date attributable to sales to retail customers on the interconnected system was  kw in july montana dakota s latest forecast for its interconnected system indicates that its annual peak will continue to occur during the summer and the peak demand growth rate through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota s latest forecast indicates that its kilowatt hour kwh sales growth rate  on a normalized basis  through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota currently estimates that  with modifications already made and those expected to be made  it has adequate capacity available through existing generating stations and long term firm purchase contracts until the year if additional capacity is needed in or after  it will be met through the addition of combustion turbine peaking stations and purchases from the mid continent area power pool mapp on an intermediate term basis 
montana dakota has major interconnections with its neighboring utilities  all of which are mapp members 
montana dakota considers these interconnections adequate for coordinated planning  emergency assistance  exchange of capacity and energy and power supply reliability 
through a separate electric system sheridan system  montana dakota serves sheridan  wyoming and neighboring communities 
the maximum peak demand experienced to date and attributable to montana dakota sales to retail consumers on that system was approximately  kw and occurred in december the sheridan system is supplied through an interconnection with black hills power and light company under a power supply contract through december  which allows for the purchase of up to  kw of capacity 
regulation and competition the electric utility industry can be expected to continue to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
the ferc  in its order no 
 has required that utilities provide open access and comparable transmission service to third parties 
in addition  as a result of competition in electric generation  wholesale power markets have become increasingly competitive and evaluations are ongoing concerning retail competition 
in march  the mapp  of which montana dakota is a member  filed a restated operating agreement with the ferc 
the ferc approved mapp s restated agreement  excluding mapp s market based rate proposal  effective november in  the ferc approved mapp s request to use each member s individual market based tariffs which were already on file and approved by the ferc 
the montana legislature passed an electric industry restructuring bill  effective may  the bill provides for full customer choice of electric supplier by july   stranded cost recovery and other provisions 
based on the provisions of such restructuring bill  because the company s utility division operates in more than one state  the company has the option of deferring its transition to full customer choice until in its legislative session  the north dakota legislature established an electric industry competition committee to study over a six year period the impact of competition on the generation  transmission and distribution of electric energy in the state 
in  the wypsc selected a consultant to perform a study on the impact of electric restructuring in wyoming 
the study found no material economic benefits 
no further action is pending at this time 
the sdpuc has not initiated any proceedings to date concerning retail competition or electric industry restructuring 
federal legislation addressing this issue continues to be discussed 
although montana dakota is unable to predict the outcome of such regulatory proceedings or legislation  or the extent to which retail competition may occur  montana dakota is continuing to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
fuel adjustment clauses contained in north dakota and south dakota jurisdictional electric rate schedules allow montana dakota to reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs excluding demand charges on a timely basis 
expedited rate filing procedures in wyoming allow montana dakota to timely reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs 
in montana percent of electric revenues  such cost changes are includible in general rate filings 
environmental matters montana dakota s electric operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations providing for air  water and solid waste pollution control  state facility siting regulations  zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities  federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards 
montana dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures which will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
montana dakota did not incur any significant environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any significant capital expenditures related to environmental compliance through natural gas distribution general montana dakota sells natural gas and propane at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system 
these services are provided through a distribution system aggregating over  miles 
montana dakota has obtained and holds valid and existing franchises authorizing it to conduct natural gas and propane distribution operations in all of the municipalities it serves where such franchises are required 
as of december   montana dakota s net natural gas and propane distribution plant investment approximated million 
all of montana dakota s natural gas distribution properties  with certain exceptions  are subject to the lien of the indenture of mortgage dated may   as supplemented  amended and restated  from the company to the bank of new york and douglas j 
macinnes  successor trustees 
the natural gas and propane distribution operations of montana dakota are subject to regulation by the ndpsc  mtpsc  sdpuc and wypsc regarding retail rates  service  accounting and  in certain instances  security issuances 
the percentage of montana dakota s natural gas and propane utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows north dakota percent  montana percent  south dakota percent and wyoming percent 
system supply  system demand and competition montana dakota serves retail natural gas markets  consisting principally of residential and firm commercial space and water heating users  in portions of the following states and major communities north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson  williston  minot and jamestown  eastern montana  including billings  glendive and miles city  western and north central south dakota  including rapid city  pierre and mobridge  and northern wyoming  including sheridan 
these markets are highly seasonal and sales volumes depend on the weather 
the following table reflects montana dakota s natural gas and propane sales  natural gas transportation volumes and degree days as a percentage of normal during the last five years years ended december  mdk thousands of decatherms sales residential      commercial      industrial total      transportation commercial      industrial      total      total throughput      degree days of normal the restructuring of the natural gas industry  as described under pipeline and energy services operations and property  has resulted in additional competition in retail natural gas markets 
in response to these changed market conditions montana dakota has established various natural gas transportation service rates for its distribution business to retain interruptible commercial and industrial load 
certain of these services include transportation under flexible rate schedules whereby montana dakota s interruptible customers can avail themselves of the advantages of open access transportation on the system of williston basin interstate pipeline company williston basin  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wbi holdings 
these services have enhanced montana dakota s competitive posture with alternate fuels  although certain of montana dakota s customers have the potential of bypassing montana dakota s distribution system by directly accessing williston basin s facilities 
montana dakota acquires its system requirements directly from producers  processors and marketers 
such natural gas is supplied under contracts specifying market based pricing  and is transported under firm transportation agreements by williston basin  northern gas company  south dakota intrastate pipeline company and northern border pipeline company 
montana dakota has also contracted with williston basin to provide firm storage services which enable montana dakota to meet winter peak requirements as well as allow it to better manage its natural gas costs by purchasing natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year 
montana dakota estimates that  based on regional supplies of natural gas currently available through its suppliers and expected to be available  it will have adequate supplies of natural gas to meet its system requirements for the next five years 
regulatory matters montana dakota s retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting monthly adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity  transportation and storage costs 
current regulatory practices allow montana dakota to recover increases or refund decreases in such costs within months from the time such changes occur 
environmental matters montana dakota s natural gas and propane distribution operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations 
montana dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
utility services utility services offers contract services in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution construction and maintenance  fiber optic cable construction  engineering and material sales 
these services are provided to electric  natural gas and telecommunication companies throughout the western united states 
during  the company acquired utility services companies based in montana and oregon 
none of these acquisitions were individually material 
utility services operates in a highly competitive business 
most of utility services work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost plus or fixed price contracts 
the workforce and equipment are all mobile and can be moved to wherever the markets are 
as a result  the market area can be large 
competition is primarily based on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability 
the size and area location of the services provided will be a factor in the number of competitors that utility services will encounter on any particular project 
utility services believes that the diversification of the services it provides will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment 
in the aggregate  electric utilities represent the largest customer base 
accordingly  electric utilities account for a significant portion of the work performed by the utility services segment 
utility services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long term relationships with these customers 
construction and maintenance crews are active year round 
however  activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
pipeline and energy services general williston basin  the principal regulated business of wbi holdings  owns and operates over  miles of transmission  gathering and storage lines and compressor stations located in the states of montana  north dakota  south dakota and wyoming 
through three underground storage fields located in montana and wyoming  storage services are provided to local distribution companies  producers  natural gas marketers and others  and serve to enhance system deliverability 
williston basin s system is strategically located near five natural gas producing basins making natural gas supplies available to williston basin s transportation and storage customers 
at december   williston basin s net plant investment was approximately million 
wbi holdings also owns a gathering entity with operations in wyoming which include various field gathering lines and leased compression facilities which interconnect with williston basin s system 
an underground natural gas storage facility in kentucky and a one sixth interest in the assets of various offshore gathering and transmission pipelines and associated onshore pipeline and related processing facilities are also owned by wbi holdings 
in addition  wbi holdings  through its energy services businesses  seeks new energy markets while continuing to expand present markets for natural gas 
its activities include buying and selling natural gas and arranging transportation services to end users  pipelines  municipals and local distribution companies and operating two retail propane operations in north central and southeastern north dakota 
the energy services segment transacts a significant portion of its business on the williston basin and texas gas transmission corp 
pipeline systems  serving customers in the rocky mountain  upper midwest  southern and central regions of the united states 
under the natural gas act  as amended  williston basin and certain other operations of wbi holdings are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc regarding certificate  rate and accounting matters 
system demand and competition the natural gas pipeline industry  although regulated  is very competitive 
beginning in the mid s  customers began switching their natural gas service from a bundled merchant service to transportation  and with the implementation of order which unbundled pipelines services  this transition was accelerated 
this change reflects most customers willingness to purchase their natural gas supply from producers  processors or marketers rather than pipelines 
williston basin competes with several pipelines for its customers transportation business and at times will have to discount rates in an effort to retain market share 
however  the strategic location of williston basin s system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services provided by williston basin along with interconnections with other pipelines serve to enhance williston basin s competitive position 
although a significant portion of williston basin s firm customers  including montana dakota  have relatively secure residential and commercial end users  virtually all have some price sensitive end users that could switch to alternate fuels 
williston basin transports substantially all of montana dakota s natural gas utilizing firm transportation agreements  which at december   represented percent of williston basin s currently subscribed firm transportation capacity 
in november  montana dakota executed a new firm transportation agreement with williston basin for a term of five years which began in july in addition  in july  montana dakota entered a twenty year contract with williston basin to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting montana dakota s winter peak requirements 
system supply williston basin s underground storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately  million cubic feet mmcf  including  mmcf and  mmcf of recoverable and nonrecoverable native gas  respectively 
williston basin s storage facilities enable its customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and  thus  facilitate meeting winter peak requirements 
natural gas supplies from traditional regional sources have declined during the past several years and such declines are anticipated to continue 
as a result  williston basin anticipates that a potentially significant amount of the future supply needed to meet its customers demands will come from non traditional  off system sources 
williston basin expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services 
opportunities may exist to increase transportation and storage services through system expansion or other pipeline interconnections or enhancements which could provide substantial future benefits to williston basin 
regulatory matters and revenues subject to refund williston basin had pending with the ferc a general natural gas rate change application implemented in in october  williston basin appealed to the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit dc circuit court certain issues decided by the ferc in orders concerning the proceeding 
on january   the dc circuit court issued its opinion remanding the issues of return on equity  ad valorem taxes and throughput to the ferc for further explanation and justification 
the mandate was issued by the dc circuit court to the ferc on march  by order dated june   the ferc remanded the return on equity issue to an administrative law judge for further proceedings 
on october   the ferc approved a settlement proposed by the parties to the proceeding which resolves the remanded return on equity issue and concludes the proceeding 
based on the ferc s approval of this settlement  williston basin sought reimbursement from its customers in the fourth quarter of of a portion of the refunds made in relating to the return on equity issue 
in june  williston basin filed a general rate increase application with the ferc 
as a result of ferc orders issued after williston basin s application was filed  williston basin filed revised base rates in december with the ferc 
williston basin began collecting such increase effective january   subject to refund 
in july  the ferc issued an order which addressed various issues including storage cost allocations  return on equity and throughput 
in august  williston basin requested rehearing of such order 
on june   the ferc issued an order approving and denying various issues addressed in williston basin s rehearing request  and also remanding the return on equity issue to an administrative law judge for further proceedings 
on july   williston basin requested rehearing of certain issues which were contained in the june  ferc order 
on september   the ferc granted williston basin s request for rehearing with respect to the return on equity issue but also ordered williston basin to issue interim refunds prior to the final determination in this proceeding 
as a result  on october   williston basin issued refunds to its customers totaling million  all from amounts which had previously been reserved 
in mid december  a hearing was held before the ferc regarding the return on equity issue 
in addition  on july   williston basin appealed to the dc circuit court certain issues concerning storage cost allocations as decided by the ferc in its june  order 
on october   the dc circuit court issued an order which dismissed williston basin s appeal but permitted williston basin to again appeal such previously contested issues upon final determination of all issues by the ferc in this proceeding 
on december   williston basin filed a general natural gas rate change application with the ferc 
williston basin will begin collecting such rates effective june   subject to refund 
reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund with respect to pending regulatory proceedings and to reflect future resolution of certain issues with the ferc 
based on the june  ferc orders referenced above  williston basin in the second quarter of determined that reserves it had previously established exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves in the amount of million after tax 
williston basin believes that its remaining reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings 
environmental matters wbi holdings is generally subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations 
wbi holdings believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
other during the third quarter of  the company and williston basin reached resolution with respect to certain production tax and other state tax matters that had been outstanding  some dating back to deficiency claims of approximately million  plus interest  had been received with respect to these issues 
as a result in september  williston basin reversed reserves which were no longer needed in an amount of million after tax 
oil and natural gas production general fidelity exploration production company fidelity  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of wbi holdings  is involved in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas resources 
fidelity s operations include the acquisition of producing properties with potential development opportunities  exploratory drilling and the operation of natural gas production properties 
fidelity shares revenues and expenses from the development of specified properties located throughout the united states and in the gulf of mexico in proportion to its interests 
fidelity also owns in fee or holds natural gas leases for the properties it operates in montana  north dakota and colorado 
these rights are in the cedar creek anticline in southeastern montana  in the bowdoin area located in north central montana and the bonny field located in eastern colorado 
the oil and natural gas activities have continued to expand since the mid s 
fidelity continues to seek additional reserve and production opportunities through the direct acquisition of producing properties and through exploratory drilling opportunities  as well as routine development of its existing properties 
future growth is dependent upon continuing success in these endeavors

construction materials and mining construction materials general knife river operates construction materials and mining businesses in alaska  california  hawaii  montana  oregon and wyoming 
these operations mine  process and sell construction aggregates crushed rock  sand and gravel and supply ready mixed concrete for use in most types of construction  including homes  schools  shopping centers  office buildings and industrial parks as well as roads  freeways and bridges 
in addition  certain operations produce and sell asphalt for various commercial and roadway applications 
although not common to all locations  other products include the sale of cement  various finished concrete products and other building materials and related construction services 
during  the company acquired several construction materials and mining companies with operations in california  montana  oregon and wyoming 
none of these acquisitions were individually material 
knife river s construction materials business has continued to grow since its first acquisition in and now comprises the majority of knife river s business 
knife river continues to investigate the acquisition of other construction materials properties  particularly those relating to sand and gravel aggregates and related products such as ready mixed concrete  asphalt and various finished aggregate products 
knife river s construction materials business should continue to benefit from the transportation equity act for the st century tea  which was signed into law in june tea represents an average increase in federal highway construction funding of approximately percent for the six fiscal years to the construction materials business had approximately million in backlog in mid february  compared to approximately million in mid february the company anticipates that a significant amount of the current backlog will be completed during the year ending december  competition knife river s construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions 
since there are generally no measurable product differences in the market areas in which knife river conducts its construction materials businesses  price is the principal competitive force to which these products are subject  with service  delivery time and proximity to the customer also being significant factors 
the number and size of competitors varies in each of knife river s principal market areas and product lines 
the demand for construction materials products is significantly influenced by the cyclical nature of the construction industry in general 
in addition  construction materials activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
the key economic factors affecting product demand are changes in the level of local  state and federal governmental spending  general economic conditions within the market area which influence both the commercial and private sectors  and prevailing interest rates 
knife river is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers for sales of its construction materials products  the loss of which would have a materially adverse affect on its construction materials businesses 
during  and  no single customer accounted for more than percent of annual construction materials revenues 
coal general knife river is engaged in lignite coal mining operations 
knife river s surface mining operations are located at beulah  north dakota and savage  montana 
the average annual production from the beulah and savage mines approximates million and  tons  respectively 
reserve estimates related to these mine locations are discussed herein 
during the last five years  knife river mined and sold the following amounts of lignite coal years ended december  in thousands tons sold montana dakota generating stations jointly owned generating stations montana dakota s share others      industrial and other sales total      revenues      knife river s lignite coal operations are subjected to competition from coal and other alternate fuel sources 
currently  virtually all of the coal requirements of the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations are met with coal supplied by knife river under various long term contracts 
these contracts with the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations expire in may  december  and december  respectively 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the resolution of a suit and arbitration filed by the co owners of the coyote station against knife river and the company 
in  knife river supplied approximately million tons of coal to these three stations 
consolidated construction materials and mining environmental matters knife river s construction materials and mining operations are subject to regulation customary for surface mining operations  including federal  state and local environmental and reclamation regulations 
knife river believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
reserve information as of december   the combined construction materials operations had under ownership or lease approximately million tons of recoverable aggregate reserves 
as of december   knife river had under ownership or lease  reserves of approximately million tons of recoverable lignite coal  million tons of which are at present mining locations 
knife river estimates that approximately million tons of its reserves will be needed to supply montana dakota s coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations for the expected lives of those stations and to fulfill the existing commitments of knife river for sales to third parties

additionally  the us court of appeals remanded the case to the federal district court for further determination of the prices and volumes to be used for determination of damages 
the us court of appeals also remanded to the lower court for further consideration the issue of whether pre judgment interest on damages is recoverable by moncrief 
as a result of the decision by the us court of appeals  the prior judgment of million by the federal district court was vacated 
on december   a settlement was entered into between williston basin and moncrief whereby williston basin paid moncrief million in settlement of all claims 
on december   the united states district court  district of wyoming dismissed the case 
on february   the ferc issued an order which entitles williston basin to recover from customers virtually all of the costs which were incurred as a result of the settlement of this litigation as supply realignment transition costs pursuant to the provisions of the ferc s order williston basin began collecting such amounts from customers effective february  in december  apache corporation apache and snyder oil corporation snyder filed suit in north dakota northwest judicial district court north dakota district court against williston basin and the company 
apache and snyder are oil and natural gas producers which had processing agreements with koch hydrocarbon company koch 
williston basin and the company had a natural gas purchase contract with koch 
apache and snyder alleged they were entitled to damages for the breach of williston basin s and the company s contract with koch 
apache and snyder submitted damage estimates under differing theories aggregating up to million without interest 
in november  the north dakota district court entered an order directing the entry of judgment in favor of williston basin and the company

in a related matter  in march  a suit was filed by other producers  several of which had unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the apache and snyder litigation  against koch  williston basin and the company 
the parties to this suit are making claims similar to those in the apache and snyder litigation  although no specific damages have been stated 
in williston basin s opinion  the claims of the other producers are without merit 
if any amounts are ultimately found to be due  williston basin plans to file with the ferc for recovery from customers 
however  the amount of costs that can ultimately be recovered is subject to approval by the ferc and market conditions 
in november  a suit was filed in district court  county of burleigh  state of north dakota state district court by minnkota power cooperative  inc  otter tail power company  northwestern public service company and northern municipal power agency co owners  the owners of an aggregate percent interest in the coyote electric generating station coyote station  against the company an owner of a percent interest in the coyote station and knife river

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk from time to time  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including price swap and collar agreements and natural gas futures  to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas 
the company s policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and the company has procedures in place to monitor compliance with its policies 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in relation to financial instruments in the event of nonperformance by counterparties  but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their existing credit ratings 
the swap and collar agreements call for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to counterparties based upon the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified by the agreements 
the variable price is either an oil price quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or a quoted natural gas price on the nymex  colorado interstate gas index or williams gas index 
the company believes that there is a high degree of correlation because the timing of purchases and production and the swap and collar agreements are closely matched  and hedge prices are established in the areas of operations 
gains or losses on futures contracts are deferred until the commodity transaction occurs 
the following table summarizes hedge agreements entered into by fidelity oil co 
and wbi production  inc  indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  as of december  these agreements call for fidelity oil co 
and wbi production  inc to receive fixed prices and pay variable prices

the company s net favorable position on the natural gas collar agreements outstanding at december   was  these agreements call for fidelity oil co 
to receive fixed prices and pay variable prices 
the fair value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account the current favorable or unfavorable position on open contracts 
favorable and unfavorable positions related to commodity hedge agreements are expected to be generally offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the value of the underlying commodity transactions 
interest rate risk the company uses fixed and variable rate long term debt to partially finance capital expenditures and mandatory debt retirements 
these debt agreements expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by taking advantage of market conditions when timing the placement of long term or permanent financing 
the company also has outstanding  shares of series preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption as of december  the company is obligated to make annual sinking fund contributions to retire the preferred stock and pay cumulative preferred dividends at a fixed rate of
