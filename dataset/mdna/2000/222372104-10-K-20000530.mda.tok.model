item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business strategy is primarily focused on five areas loan production  loan servicing  capital markets  insurance and other businesses ancillary to mortgage lending 
loan production and loan servicing comprise the company s mortgage banking business 
see business mortgage banking operations  business capital markets  business insurance segment and business other operations 
the company intends to continue its efforts to expand its operations in each of these areas 
a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio are the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates because the effect of interest rate changes on loan production income is counter cyclical to their effect on servicing income 
the operations of the capital markets segment include trading mortgage backed securities mbs and other mortgage related assets as well as brokering service contracts and bulk purchases and sales of whole loans 
the operations of the insurance segment includes acting as an agent and carrier in the sale of insurance  including homeowners  fire  flood  earthquake  life and disability and creditor placed auto and homeowner insurance 
other complementary services offered include title insurance agent and escrow services  appraisal and credit reporting services 
the company s results of operations historically have been influenced primarily by the level of demand for mortgage loans  which is affected by such external factors as the level and direction of interest rates  and the strength of the overall economy and the economy in each of the company s lending markets 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a then record year for the company in terms of revenues and net earnings from its ongoing operations 
loan production increased to billion  up from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i lower interest rates  ii the generally strong economy and home purchase market  iii the continued implementation of a national advertising campaign aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iv increased expansion of the consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
for calendar  the company s market share increased to approximately of the estimated billion single family mortgage origination market  up from approximately of the estimated billion single family mortgage origination market for during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion  up from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion 
the increase in the loan servicing portfolio was partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to the lower mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal during fiscal  the company sold the assets  operations and employees of countrywide asset management corporation camc  then a wholly owned subsidiary of the company to indymac mortgage holdings  inc formerly inmc mortgage holdings  inc inmc 
camc was formally the manager of inmc 
the company received  newly issued common shares of inmc as consideration 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was another record year for the company in terms of revenues and net earnings 
loan production increased to billion  an all time company record  up from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i an increase in the overall mortgage market driven largely by refinances  ii the generally strong economy and home purchase market  and iii an increase in the company s market share  driven largely by the expansion of its consumer markets home finance network and consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
during calendar  the company s market share increased to approximately  up from approximately in calendar during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion  up from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion 
this growth in the loan servicing protfolio was partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion and the transfer out of billion of subservicing 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to increased refinance activity driven by the lower mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was again a record year for the company in terms of revenues and net earnings 
loan production decreased to billion  down from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the decrease in production primarily to a decrease in the overall mortgage market driven largely by a decrease in refinance activity  combined with a slight decrease in the company s market share 
for calendar the company ranked third in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
during calendar the company s market share decreased to approximately down from approximately in calendar during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion  up from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s strong loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion 
this growth in the loan servicing protfolio was partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  down from the prior year due to the higher mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal increased to  million  up from  million for fiscal net earnings increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal the slight increase in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to the loan servicing  capital markets and insurance segments  together with increased production of non traditional loan products home equity and sub prime loans 
this was largely offset by a decline in traditional prime loan originations  attributable to the market wide decline in loan refinancings 
included in net earnings in fiscal was a nonrecurring tax benefit of million that related primarily to a corporate reorganization 
the total volume of loans produced by the company in fiscal decreased to billion  down from billion for fiscal the decrease in loan production was primarily due to a decrease in the mortgage origination market  driven largely by a reduction in refinance activity  combined with a slight decrease in the company s market share 
total loan production by purpose and by interest rate type is summarized below 
dollar amounts in millions loan production fiscal fiscal purchase   refinance   total   fixed rate   adjustable rate   total   total loan production by division is summarized below 
dollar amounts in millions loan production fiscal fiscal consumer markets division   wholesale lending division   correspondent lending division   full spectrum lending  inc  total   the factors which affect the relative volume of production among the company s divisions include the price competitiveness of each division s various product offerings  the level of mortgage lending activity in each division s market and the success of each division s sales and marketing efforts 
non traditional loan production which is included in the company s total volume of loans produced is summarized below 
dollar amounts in millions non traditional loan production fiscal fiscal sub prime   home equity loans   total   during fiscal and fiscal  the company received  and  new loan applications  respectively  at an average daily rate of million and million  respectively 
the factors that affect the percentage of applications received and funded during a given time period include the movement and direction of interest rates  the average length of loan commitments issued  the creditworthiness of applicants  the production divisions loan processing efficiency and loan pricing decisions 
loan origination fees decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower production and a change in the divisional mix 
the consumer markets and wholesale lending divisions which  due to their higher cost structure  charge higher origination fees per dollar loaned comprised a lower percentage of total production in fiscal than in fiscal gain on sale of loans also decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower production volume and reduced margins on prime credit quality mortgages 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales during fiscal of higher margin home equity and sub prime loans which  due in part to their higher cost structure charge a higher price per dollar loaned 
the sale of home equity loans contributed million and million to gain on sale of loans in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sub prime loans contributed million to the gain on sale of loans in fiscal and million in fiscal in general  loan origination fees and gain loss on sale of loans are affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans produced and sold  loan pricing decisions  interest rate volatility and the general direction of interest rates 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal net interest income is principally a function of i net interest income earned from the company s mortgage loan warehouse million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ii interest expense related to the company s investment in servicing rights million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively and iii interest income earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company earns interest on  and incurs interest expense to carry  mortgage loans held in its warehouse 
the increase in net interest income from the mortgage loan warehouse was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels as a result of a longer warehouse period combined with a higher net earnings rate during fiscal the decrease in interest expense on the investment in servicing rights resulted primarily from a decrease in the payments of interest to certain investors pursuant to customary servicing arrangements with regard to paid off loans in excess of the interest earned on these loans through their respective payoff dates interest costs incurred on payoffs as a result of lower prepayments 
the decline in interest cost incurred on payoffs was partially offset by additional interest expense from a larger servicing portfolio 
the decrease in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was primarily related to a decrease in the average custodial balances caused by decrease in the amount of prepayments 
during fiscal  loan servicing income before amortization increased primarily due to growth of the loan servicing portfolio 
as of february   the company serviced billion of loans including billion of loans subserviced for others  compared to billion including billion of loans subserviced for others as of february   a increase 
the growth in the company s servicing portfolio during fiscal was the result of loan production volume and the acquisition of bulk servicing rights  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of mortgage loans 
during fiscal  the annual prepayment rate of the company s servicing portfolio was  compared to for fiscal the prepayment rate is primarily affected by the level of refinance activity  which in turn is driven by the relative level of mortgage interest rates  as well as activity in the resale home market 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio as of february  and was 
the company recorded msr amortization and net impairment recovery for fiscal totaling million consisting of amortization amounting to million and recovery of previous impairment of million  compared to  million of amortization and impairment consisting of amortization amounting to million and impairment of million for fiscal the primary factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment of the msrs recorded in an accounting period are the level of prepayments during the period and the change  if any  in estimated future prepayments 
to mitigate the effect on earnings of msr impairment that may result from increased current and projected future prepayment activity  the company acquires financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net expense of million from its servicing hedge 
the net expense included unrealized net losses of million and realized net losses of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge net of premium amortization 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net gain of million from its servicing hedge 
the net gain included unrealized net gains of million and realized net gains of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge net of premium amortization 
the historical correlation of the servicing hedge and the msrs has been very high 
however  given the complexity and uncertainty inherent in hedging msrs  there can be no assurance that future results will match the historical performance of the servicing hedge 
the financial instruments that comprised the servicing hedge include interest rate floors  principal only securities p o securities  options on interest rate swaps swaptions  options on mbs  options on interest rate futures  interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate swaps with the company s maximum payment capped capped swaps and interest rate caps 
with the capped swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed 
the rate paid is adjustable  is indexed to the london interbank offered rates for us dollar deposits libor and has a specified maximum or cap 
with swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the company has entered into swaps in which the rate received is fixed and the rate paid is adjustable and is indexed to libor receiver swap as well as swaps in which the rate paid is fixed and the rate received is adjustable and is indexed to libor payor swap the swaptions consist of options to enter into a receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap receiver swaption and options to enter into a pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swap payor swaption at a future date or to settle the transaction for cash 
an option on mbs gives the holder the right to call a mortgage backed security at a predetermined price 
the p o securities consist of certain tranches of collateralized mortgage securities cmos  mortgage trust principal only securities and treasury principal only strips 
these securities have been purchased at deep discounts to their par values 
as interest rates decrease  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos and mortgage trust principal only securities should increase 
this results in a decline in the average lives of the p o securities and a corresponding increase in the present values of their cash flows 
conversely  as interest rates increase  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos and mortgage trust principal only securities should decrease 
this would result in an increase in the average lives of the p o securities and a decrease in the present values of their cashflows 
the prices of the treasury principal only strips are determined by the discount rate used to determine their present value  as interest rates decline the discount rate applied to the maturity principal payment declines  resulting in an increase in the price 
the servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of the msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates increase  the value of the msrs increases while the value of the hedge instruments declines 
with respect to the floors  options on interest rate futures and mbs  caps  swaptions and p o securities  the company is not exposed to loss beyond its initial outlay to acquire the hedge instruments plus any unrealized gains recognized to date 
the company s exposure to loss on futures is related to changes in the libor rate over the life of the contract 
the company was not a party to any futures contract at february  with respect to the interest rate swaps contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual terms is million 
with respect to the capped swaps contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual terms is million

the operations of other activities  excluding landsafe inc  incurred pre tax income of million during fiscal compared to pre tax income of million during fiscal this decrease in pre tax income primarily resulted from i a decrease in cci net interest income related to a receivable from chl that was eliminated by a capital contribution during fiscal and ii the discontinuance of management fees received prior to the sale of countrywide asset management corporation camc 
during fiscal  camc  a subsidiary of the company  was sold to inmc mortgage holdings  inc  inmc a publicly traded real estate investment trust for  newly issued common shares of inmc stock 
these shares are subject to resale restrictions which apply to the shares from the date of issuance through july the sale resulted in a million pre tax gain 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  the company manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination and loan servicing business segments  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company utilizes various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  mortgage backed securities retained in securitizations  trading securities and debt securities 
the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the company performs various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate scenarios including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments 
for mortgages  mbs and mbs forward contracts and cmos  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
msrs and residual interests are valued using discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
utilizing the sensitivity analyses described above  as of february   the company estimates that a permanent reduction in interest rates  all else being constant  would result in a million after tax loss related to its trading securities and there would be no loss related to its other financial instruments 
as of february   the company estimates that this combined after tax loss of million is the largest such loss that would occur within the range of reasonably possible interest rate changes 
these sensitivity analyses are limited by the fact that they are performed at a particular point in time  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used including prepayment forecasts  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such a scenario 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast 
an additional  albeit less significant  market risk facing the company is foreign currency risk 
the company has issued foreign currency denominated medium term notes see note f 
the company manages the foreign currency risk associated with such medium term notes by entering into currency swaps 
the terms of the currency swaps effectively translate the foreign currency denominated medium term notes into us dollars  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk subject to the performance of the various counterparties to the currency swaps 
as a result  hypothetical changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the areas of loan production and servicing 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancings 
although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stimulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan production  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting from overcapacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  servicing related earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and reducing amortization and impairment of the msrs  as well as interest costs incurred on payoffs  and because the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having a note rate higher than the then current interest rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting its servicing related earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the msrs  a decreased rate of interest earned from the custodial balances and increased interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the servicing hedge is designed to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on servicing related earnings 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in interest rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise in the winter months  which results in higher servicing costs 
however  late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset such incremental expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal financing needs are the financing of its mortgage loan inventory  investment in msrs and the trading securities of its broker dealer subsidiary 
to meet these needs  the company currently utilizes commercial paper supported by the revolving credit facility  medium term notes  senior debt  mbs repurchase agreements  subordinated notes  pre sale funding facilities  redeemable capital trust pass through securities  securitization of servicing fee income and cash flow from operations 
in addition  in the past the company has utilized whole loan repurchase agreements  servicing secured bank facilities  private placements of unsecured notes and other financings  direct borrowings from the revolving credit facility and public offerings of common and preferred stock 
the company strives to maintain sufficient liquidity in the form of unused  committed lines of credit  to meet anticipated short term cash requirements as well as to provide for potential sudden increases in business activity driven by changes in the market environment 
certain of the debt obligations of the company and countrywide home loans  inc chl contain various provisions that may affect the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends and remain in compliance with such obligations 
these provisions include requirements concerning net worth and other financial covenants 
these provisions have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends 
the principal financing needs of ccm consist of the financing of its inventory of securities and mortgage loans 
its securities inventory is financed primarily through mbs repurchase agreements 
ccm also has access to a million secured bank loan facility and a lending facility with chl the securities industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
ccm competes with large global investment banks and broker dealers  as well as smaller regional broker dealers 
ccm competes by specializing in mortgage related fixed income securities and through its affiliation with chl  which allow it to offer information  products and services tailored to the unique needs of participants in the mortgage related debt securities markets 
the primary cash needs for cig are to meet short term and long term obligations to policyholders payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions and the purchases of new investments 
to meet these needs  cig currently utilizes cash flow provided from operations as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
the lender placed collateral protection insurance market is dominated by a few providers competing on overall financial strength of the insurer  premium rates  policy terms and conditions  services offered  reputation and broker compensation 
the voluntary property and casualty and life and disability marketplace is dominated by large  brand name providers and is driven mostly by price and name recognition 
gic competes by providing high quality service and pricing its products at competitive rates 
the company continues to investigate and pursue alternative and supplementary methods to finance its growing operations through the public and private capital markets 
these may include such methods as mortgage loan sale transactions designed to expand the company s financial capacity and reduce its cost of capital and the securitization of servicing income cash flows 
in connection with its derivative contracts  the company may be required to deposit cash or certain government securities or obtain letters of credit to meet margin requirements 
the company considers such potential margin requirements in its overall liquidity management 
in the course of the company s mortgage banking operations  the company sells the mortgage loans it originates and purchases to investors but generally retains the right to service the loans  thereby increasing the company s investment in msrs 
the company views the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis in part as an investment vehicle 
significant unanticipated prepayments in the company s servicing portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and liquidity 
cash flows operating activities in fiscal  the company s operating activities provided cash of approximately billion on a short term basis primarily as a result of a decrease in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
in fiscal  operating activities used approximately billion on a short term basis primarily to support the increase in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion 
investing activities the primary investing activities for which cash was used by the company was the investment in msrs and the acquisition of balboa 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal financing activities net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal the increase or decrease in cash flow from financing activities was primarily the result of the change in the company s mortgage loan inventory and investment in msrs 
prospective trends applications and pipeline of loans in process for the month ended march   the company received new loan applications at an average daily rate of million 
as of march   the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion 
this compares to a daily application rate for the month ended in march  of million and a pipeline of loans in process as of march  of billion 
the size of the pipeline is generally an indication of the level of future fundings  as historically to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  the company s lock n shop r pipeline as of march  was billion and as of march  was billion 
future application levels and loan fundings are dependent on numerous factors  including the level of demand for mortgage loans  the level of competition in the market  the direction of interest rates  seasonal factors and general economic conditions 
market factors loan production decreased from fiscal to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a smaller mortgage origination market  driven by reduced refinances  combined with a slight decrease in the company s market share 
home purchase related loan production increased during the same period 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this was due primarily to a smaller mortgage origination refinance market 
the company s california mortgage loan production as measured by principal balance constituted of its total production during fiscal and during fiscal the company is continuing its efforts to expand its production capacity outside of california 
some regions in which the company operates have experienced slower economic growth  and real estate financing activity in these regions has been impacted negatively 
the company has striven to diversify its mortgage banking activities geographically to mitigate such effects 
the delinquency rate in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding sub servicing  increased to at february  from as of february  the company believes that this increase was primarily the result of changes in portfolio mix and aging 
sub prime loans which tend to experience higher delinquency rates than prime loans represented approximately of the total portfolio as of february   up from as of february  in addition  the weighted average age of the prime credit quality loans in the portfolio increased to months at february  from months in february  delinquency rates tend to increase as loans age  reaching a peak at three to five years of age 
however  because the loans in the portfolio are generally serviced on a non recourse basis  the company s exposure to credit loss resulting from increased delinquency rates is substantially limited 
furthermore  related late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset incremental servicing expenses resulting from an increased delinquency rate 
the percentage of loans in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding sub servicing  that are in foreclosure increased to as of february  from as of february  because the company services substantially all conventional loans on a non recourse basis  foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the investor or insurer and not the company 
while the company does not generally retain credit risk with respect to the conventional prime credit quality first mortgage loans it sells  it does have potential liability under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  the company may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by the company 
similarly  government loans serviced by the company of the company s servicing portfolio as of february  are insured by the federal housing administration or partially guaranteed against loss by the department of veterans administration 
the company is exposed to credit losses to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the department of veterans administration is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
the company retains credit risk on the home equity and sub prime loans it securitizes  through retention of a subordinated interest 
as of february   the company had investments in such subordinated interests amounting to million 
the company incurred bad debt expenses totaling million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to the credit risk described above 
servicing hedge as previously discussed  the company s servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of its investment in msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  the value of the servicing hedge generally declines and the value of msrs generally increases 
the historical correlation of the servicing hedge and the msrs has been very high 
however  given the complexity and uncertainty inherent in hedging msrs  there can be no assurance that future results will match the historical performance of the servicing hedge 
implementation of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize the fair value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
this statement will become effective in the fiscal year ended february  the company has not yet determined the impact upon adoption of this standard on the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise sfas no 

sfas no 
is an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
it requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities and other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those instruments 
the company adopted this statement in october and  accordingly  reclassified mortgage backed securities retained in securitization as available for sale securities 
year update reflecting the work completed on the company s year program  the company s computer systems and business processes successfully handled the date change from december  to january  the company is not aware of any significant year problems encountered internally or with third parties with which it does business  including customers  counterparties and others  the global financial market infrastructure  and the utility infrastructure on which all corporations rely 
based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing operations as a result of the year issue 
however  although remote  it is possible that the full impact of year issues has not been fully recognized and no assurances can be given that year problems will not emerge 
to the extent any year issues arise  that could expose the company to certain risks  such as the nonperformance by third parties of obligations to the company 
the pre tax cost associated with the required systems modifications and conversions totaled approximately million of which all had been incurred through february  the company had previously estimated the cost at approximately million 
management believes a significant amount of the work incurred in connection with the year issue will have ongoing utility by way of improved software coding and systems documentation
