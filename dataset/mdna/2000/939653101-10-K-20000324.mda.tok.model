tenant improvements tenant improvements are costs associated with commercial lease transactions such as painting and carpeting 
during  writ s average tenant improvement costs per square foot of space leased were as follows office retail industrial the retail and industrial tenant improvement costs are substantially lower than office improvement costs because the tenant improvements required in these property types are substantially less extensive than in offices 
writ s office tenant improvement costs are among the lowest in the industry for a number of reasons 
approximately of our office tenants renew their leases with writ  and renewing tenants generally require minimal tenant improvements 
in addition  lower tenant improvement costs is one of the many benefits of writ s focus on leasing to smaller office tenants 
smaller office suites have limited configuration alternatives 
therefore  writ is often able to lease an existing suite with tenant improvements being limited to new paint and carpet 
other capital improvements other capital improvements are those not included in the above categories 
these are also referred to as recurring capital improvements 
over time these costs will be reincurred to maintain a property s income and value 
in our residential properties  these include new appliances  flooring  cabinets  bathroom fixtures  and the like
