item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations consolidated cash flows and liquidity and capital resources management s discussion and analysis tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts  all per share amounts assume dilution all per share information is computed using weighted average shares outstanding  assuming dilution 
introduction management s discussion and analysis is presented in four sections 
the introductory section discusses bottling transactions  acquisitions  market risk including the euro conversion  year  asset impairment and restructuring charges and a new accounting standard pages 
the second section analyzes the results of operations  first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our business segments pages 
the final two sections address our consolidated cash flows and liquidity and capital resources pages 
cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports including the chairman s letter accompanying this annual report and in oral statements  we discuss expectations regarding our future performance  the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of current global macro economic issues 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from expectations 
bottling transactions during  we completed four transactions creating four anchor bottlers 
in april  certain wholly owned bottling businesses  referred to as the pepsi bottling group pbg  completed an initial public offering with pepsico retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 
in may  we combined certain bottling operations with whitman corporation to create new whitman  retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 
in july  we formed a business venture with pepcom industries  inc  a pepsi cola franchisee  retaining a noncontrolling interest in the venture of 
in october  we formed a business venture with pohlad companies  a pepsi cola franchisee  retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately in the venture s principal operating subsidiary 
details of these transactions are found in note acquisitions during  we made acquisitions  primarily investments in various bottlers including investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which aggregated million in cash 
during  acquisitions aggregated billion in cash including tropicana products  inc for billion and the smith s snackfoods company tssc in australia for million  the remaining ownership interest in various bottlers and purchases of various other international salty snack food businesses 
the results of operations of acquisitions are generally included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are o commodity prices  affecting the cost of our raw materials  o foreign exchange risks  and o interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios 
commodity prices we are subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated commodity purchases  primarily oil  corn  fuel and juice concentrates 
we had commodity futures positions of million at december  and million at december  unrealized losses on net commodity futures positions were million at december  and million at december  we estimate that a decline in commodity prices would have increased the unrealized losses by million and the unrealized losses by million 
foreign exchange risks operating in international markets involves exposure to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements on us is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  can cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constitute about of our and of our consolidated operating profit  excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in foreign exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for include the mexican peso  british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact operating profit by approximately million in and million in this represents of our non us operating profit after adjusting for asset impairment and restructuring charges 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one country may or may not be offset by losses from another country 
foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses and also translation gains and losses arising from the remeasurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
there were net foreign exchange losses of million in  million in and million in the decrease in net foreign exchange losses in resulted primarily from the impact in of unfavorable macro economic conditions  primarily in russia and asia pacific 
in  the economic turmoil in russia which accompanied the devaluation of the ruble had an adverse impact on our operations 
consequently  we experienced a significant drop in demand  resulting in lower net sales and increased operating losses 
also  since net bottling sales in russia were denominated in rubles  whereas a substantial portion of our related costs and expenses were denominated in us dollars  bottling operating margins were further eroded 
in response to these conditions  we reduced our cost structure primarily by closing facilities  renegotiating manufacturing contracts and reducing the number of employees 
we also wrote down our long lived bottling assets to give effect to the resulting impairment 
see asset impairment and restructuring charges on page on january   of member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and financial systems  business processes and equipment  such as vending machines  to accommodate euro denominated transactions and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
since financial systems and processes currently accommodate multiple currencies  the plans contemplate conversion by the middle of if not already addressed in conjunction with other system or process initiatives 
we do not expect the system and equipment conversion costs to be material 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on financial condition or results of operations 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
we use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances  with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt 
accordingly  any market risk or opportunity associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our investment portfolios primarily consist of cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is our practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end and variable rate debt and investment levels  a one point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by million in and million in the change in this impact from resulted from decreased variable rate debt levels and increased variable rate investment levels at year end this sensitivity analysis does not take into account existing interest rate swaps 
year to date  neither we nor our franchise bottlers have experienced major disruptions related to the year date change 
in addition  we are not aware of significant year disruptions impacting our customers or suppliers 
we will continue to monitor our critical systems over the next several months but do not anticipate a significant impact as a result of the year date change 
incremental costs directly related to year issues for new pepsico totaled million from to approximately of the total estimated spending represents costs to repair systems while approximately represents costs to replace and rewrite software 
excluded from the estimated incremental costs for new pepsico for the three year period are approximately million of internal recurring costs related to our year efforts 
asset impairment and restructuring charges asset impairment charges held and used in the business property  plant and equipment intangible assets other assets held for disposal abandonment property  plant and equipment investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
net assets of business units total asset impairment restructuring charges employee related costs other charges total restructuring total after tax per share impairment by segment frito lay north america frito lay international pepsi cola north america pepsi cola international combined segments bottling operations the asset impairment and restructuring charge of million recognized in the first quarter relates to the closure of three plants and impairment of equipment at frito lay north america 
this charge was the second phase of a productivity improvement plan developed in the fourth quarter of the plan included the consolidation of us production to newer and more efficient plants and streamlining logistics and transportation systems 
the restructuring is expected to generate approximately million in annual savings beginning in which we expect to reinvest back into the business 
the asset impairment charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land and buildings to their estimated fair market value based on current selling prices for comparable real estate  less costs to sell  and the write off of the net book value of equipment which cannot be redeployed 
the plant closures were completed during the majority of these assets were either disposed of or abandoned in the restructuring charges of million primarily included severance costs for approximately employees and plant closing costs 
substantially all of the terminations occurred during the asset impairment and restructuring charges of million were comprised of the following o a charge of million for asset impairment of million and restructuring charges of million related to our russian bottling operations 
the economic turmoil in russia which accompanied the august devaluation of the ruble adversely impacted our operations 
consequently  we experienced a significant drop in demand  resulting in lower net sales and increased operating losses 
also  since net bottling sales in russia were denominated in rubles  whereas a substantial portion of our related costs and expenses were denominated in us dollars  bottling operating margins were further eroded 
in response to these conditions  we reduced our cost structure primarily through closing facilities  renegotiating manufacturing contracts and reducing the number of employees 
we also evaluated our long lived bottling assets for impairment  triggered by the reduction in utilization of assets caused by the lower demand  the adverse change in the business climate and the expected continuation of operating losses and cash deficits in that market 
the impairment charge reduced the net book value of the assets to their estimated fair market value  based primarily on amounts recently paid for similar assets in that marketplace 
of the total charge of million  million related to bottling operations that became part of pbg in see bottling transactions on page 
o an impairment charge of million related to manufacturing equipment at frito lay north america 
as part of our annual assessment of marketing plans and related capacity requirements at frito lay north america and the development of a program to improve manufacturing productivity  we determined that certain product specific equipment would not be utilized and certain capital projects would be terminated to avoid production redundancies 
the charge primarily reflected the write off of the net book value of the equipment and related projects 
disposal or abandonment of these assets was completed in o a charge of million for employee related costs resulting from the separation of pepsi cola north america s concentrate and bottling organizations to more effectively serve retail customers in light of the conversion of pbg to public ownership see bottling transactions on page 
of this amount  million related to bottling operations that became part of pbg in the employee related costs for of million primarily included severance and relocation costs for approximately  employees located in the russian bottling plants and at pepsi cola north america field locations 
during  approximately  of the terminations occurred most of which were terminations of part time employees with little associated cost 
the remaining terminations either occurred in or related to the bottling operations that became part of pbg in the asset impairment and restructuring charges of million were comprised of the following o net charges of million in several of our business segments for net asset impairment of million related to the planned disposal of assets and for restructuring charges of million 
the impairment charges were taken as a result of decisions to dispose of certain company owned bottling operations and non core international businesses  to dispose of certain assets to improve the utilization of facilities and to reduce occupancy costs and to exit certain bottling joint ventures 
the impairment charges reduced the net book value of these assets to their estimated fair market value  generally based on estimates developed internally or  if available  amounts paid for similar assets  less costs to sell 
the disposals occurred in and and in connection with the separation of certain company owned bottling operations see bottling transactions on page 
the restructuring charges primarily related to the reorganization of an international company owned bottling operation 
o charges of million for asset impairment of million and restructuring charges of million related to productivity initiatives in worldwide snacks 
these initiatives included closing plants  eliminating production lines and consolidating distribution facilities 
the resulting impairment charges were recognized primarily for assets held for disposal or abandonment and reduced the net book value of impaired assets to their estimated fair market value  generally based on estimates developed internally or  if available  amounts paid for similar assets  less costs to sell 
disposal or abandonment of these assets was substantially completed in  with a significant portion of the remainder completed in as planned 
o net charges of million for net asset impairment of million and net restructuring charges of million related to actions to strengthen our international bottling structure 
restructuring charges of million consisted of third party termination payments related to refranchising bottling operations and our investments in bottling joint ventures 
these charges were substantially offset by an arbitration settlement of million which we were awarded as a result of the termination of the bottling appointment with our previous venezuelan bottler 
the employee related costs for of million primarily included severance and relocation costs for approximately  employees primarily located in international plants and distribution centers 
during  terminations of approximately  employees occurred and  in  approximately terminations occurred 
as a result of the successful redeployment of employees to other locations  approximately terminations did not occur as planned which resulted in a change of estimate in the restructuring reserves are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
at year end  the remaining liability for restructuring charges associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates was million related to indemnifications of litigation liabilities 
the remaining carrying amounts of assets held for disposal at year end were million in  million in and million in the net sales from international bottling business units held for disposal were million in and million in such businesses generated operating profits of million in and million in our investments in unconsolidated affiliates held for disposal provided break even results in and losses of million in and million in new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for our fiscal year beginning sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are currently assessing the effects of adopting sfas and have not yet made a determination of the impact adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements

reported net sales decreased billion in reflecting the deconsolidation of pbg  pbo and pepcom operations as of the transaction closing dates  partially offset by the inclusion of tropicana for the first three quarters of new pepsico net sales  before the intercompany elimination  increased billion 
this increase primarily reflects the inclusion of tropicana for the first three quarters of  volume gains at worldwide frito lay and higher effective net pricing at worldwide frito lay and pepsi cola north america 
volume gains contributed percentage points of growth and higher effective pricing contributed percentage points 
these advances were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact 
the unfavorable foreign currency impact  primarily in brazil and mexico  reduced new pepsico net sales growth by nearly percentage points
