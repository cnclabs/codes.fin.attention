other information labor agreements 
approximately of the company s employees are members of collective bargaining units 
in and  the company signed seven new agreements with its domestic collective bargaining groups

income taxes 
sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and treasury regulations limit the amounts of net operating losses nols  alternative minimum tax net operating losses amtnols and credits that can be used to offset taxable income or used as a credit in any single tax year if the corporation experiences more than a ownership change  as defined in the code  over a three year testing period ending on the testing date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding income taxes and nols  amtnols and credits 
management believes that an offering of outstanding common stock by existing stockholders in november triggered an ownership change  but that no ownership change occurred before that time 
if an ownership change did occur as a result of that offering  management believes that  even as limited by the code  the company would use the nols  amtnols and credits significantly earlier than their expiration and the annual limitations would not adversely impact the company 
however  if the internal revenue service were to successfully assert that an ownership change had occurred on any date prior to november including august  when the company entered into labor agreements that provided stock for labor cost savings  the company s ability to use its nols  amtnols and credits would be significantly impaired because the value of nwa corp 
s stock on certain prior testing dates was relatively low and a low value would adversely affect the annual limitation 
detroit midfield terminal 
the company is managing and supervising the design and construction of a billion terminal at detroit metropolitan wayne county airport 
the new terminal is scheduled to be completed in and will add gates and a regional jet aircraft facility as well as over shops and restaurants  four worldclubs  larger ticketing areas  a  space parking facility and significant luggage handling system upgrades 
the new terminal has been funded by the county s issuance of general airport revenue bonds payable primarily from future passenger facility charges and federal and state of michigan grants 
the company and the county have entered into agreements pursuant to which the company will lease space in the new terminal for a term of years from the date the terminal opens 
regulation 
in april  the dot issued proposed competition guidelines  which would severely limit major carriers ability to compete with new entrant carriers 
in addition  the department of justice is investigating competition at major hub airports 
the outcomes of the dot guidelines and the investigations cannot be predicted 
however  to the extent that restrictions are imposed upon northwest s ability to respond to competition  northwest s business may be adversely impacted 
year the company has successfully completed its year project and transitioned into the new year with no year related service interruptions

actual results may differ 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
in order to provide a measure of control over price and supply  the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations 
the company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges and fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel based on projected fuel usage which would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  net of gains realized from fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december   compared to an estimated million at december  as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its fuel requirements  compared to at december  foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
from time to time  the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company s revenues and expenses are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending december   net of gains realizable from yen hedge instruments outstanding at december   compared to an estimated million decrease at december  this is due to the company s foreign currency denominated revenues exceeding its foreign currency denominated expenses 
the company also has a foreign currency non cash exposure 
an increase to other income caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated liabilities and the increase to common stockholders equity deficit due to the translation of net yen denominated liabilities resulting from a strengthening in the value of the us dollar is not material for and this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as of december  and in  the company s yen denominated revenues exceeded its yen denominated expenses by approximately billion yen approximately million and its yen denominated liabilities exceeded its yen denominated assets by an average of eight billion yen approximately million compared with billion yen approximately million and billion yen approximately million  respectively  in in general  each time the yen strengthens weakens  the company s operating income is favorably unfavorably impacted due to net yen denominated revenues exceeding expenses and a non operating foreign currency loss gain is recognized due to the remeasurement of net yen denominated liabilities 
the company s operating income in was favorably impacted by approximately million due to the average yen being stronger in compared to and negatively impacted in by approximately million due to the average yen being weaker in compared to the yen to us dollar exchange rate at december   and was yen to  yen to and yen to  respectively 
there was no material impact on and earnings associated with the japanese yen financial instruments utilized to hedge its and net yen denominated cash flows 
as of december   the company had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately of its yen denominated sales  compared to at december   which also represents approximately of the company s excess of yen denominated revenues over expenses in and interest 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments and its interest expense from floating rate debt instruments 
the company has mitigated this risk by limiting its floating rate indebtedness to approximately and of long term debt and capital leases at december  and  respectively 
if long term interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s net interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  if short term interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments would increase by approximately million compared to an estimated million for measured at december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s floating rate indebtedness  cash equivalent and short term investment balances at december  and market risk for fixed rate indebtedness is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million during  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  the fair values of the company s indebtedness were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements
