asp hosting revenues increased due to the company s focus on expanding this business and adding several new significant customers during fiscal maintenance revenues increased due to an expanding customer base 
as a result of yk concerns  many customers and prospects delayed licensing and implementation of software until the passage of january  this led to a decrease in license revenues and a decrease in professional services revenues 
the company believes  based on activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal  that yk will not have a material impact on future financial results 
backlog for the company s products and services of approximately million as of july   of which approximately million is scheduled to be satisfied within one year  is primarily composed of recurring software license and maintenance revenues for ongoing maintenance and support  software implementation and consulting services  and asp hosting services 
software agreements for recurring license fees generally have non cancelable terms of up to five years

product development and support expense product development and support expense consists primarily of research and development efforts  amortization of capitalized software development costs  customer support  and other product support costs 
for the fiscal year ended july   product development and support expense increased

acquired in process research and development and related costs based on the results of an independent third party appraisal  the company recorded charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to expense in process research and development in process r d costs related to the acquisition of formmaker 
the aggregate purchase price related to the merger  including direct acquisition costs  was approximately million which was allocated to the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired  including in process r d 
acquired in process r d represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by formmaker in process r d 
the allocation of million to in process r d represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the in process r d projects 
in the opinion of management and independent third party appraisers  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and therefore  the in process r d had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were charged to operations on the closing date of the merger 
the value assigned to purchased in process r d was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process r d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process r d was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by formmaker and its competitors 
the estimated revenues for the in process r d assumed a compound annual growth rate of approximately in the four years following introduction  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
for each of the acquired in process r d efforts  the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three to four years of acquisition and then decline as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability associated with formmaker s in process r d  a discount rate of was used to value in process r d  and a discount rate of was used for the existing products and technology 
this discount rate was commensurate with the acquired in process r d projects stages of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
as of the date of the merger  formmaker had spent approximately million on in process r d projects 
subsequent to the date of the merger  the company expended approximately million for the completion of the in process r d projects which approximated the expected costs to complete such projects 
milestones for the in process r d projects were also examined as of the date of the merger 
for each in process r d project  company engineers evaluated the critical milestones 
this included comprehensive analysis of each of the acquired product lines in process r d to clarify the technological hurdles that the development team had overcome at the date of the merger as well as the hurdles that the engineers faced going forward to complete the remaining development efforts 
from this analysis  the overall significance of tasks completed versus tasks remaining were assessed 
for all categories  a greater level of significance was associated with completed tasks 
this implied that a greater degree of overall value was attributable to the completed tasks relative to those indicated by the cost metrics 
based on estimates made by formmaker s r d professionals regarding technical achievements completed as of the date of the merger  the milestone percentage was determined to be approximately 
utilizing this milestone analysis for the in process r d valuation resulted in values for incomplete r d projects which approximated the million appraisal value 
at the time of the merger  formmaker offered a basic portfolio of document automation processing and imaging software products 
formmaker s product lines and related services stemmed from its dap and multi user archival retrieval system mars technologies 
the acquired in process r d value was comprised of several ongoing projects intended to address the issues of technological advances in the marketplace such as new client server architecture  new delivery mechanisms  the internet  emergence of the windows nt operating system  object integration on the desktop  and new standards such as microsoft s active x  microsoft s odbc  and sun microsystems java  which were making the development and implementation of new products increasingly complex 
these advances in technology required creating highly advanced products that could handle substantial increases in demand  as well as end user requirements for more complex graphics intensive material 
this led to development efforts which centered around new dap and mars technologies and incorporated innovative new features and a wide array of advanced functions 
formmaker was addressing industry and technological trends by developing new delivery mechanisms via the internet  object integration on the desktop  new dap architecture  platform independence  improved workflow functionality  product compatibility  dap and mars integration  and the development of migration and upgrade paths 
at the merger date  there were still significant efforts needed to bring the acquired in process technologies and projects to fruition 
these efforts principally related to the completion of planning  designing  architecturing  coding  prototyping  scalability  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies would meet their design specifications 
these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility at the time of the merger 
management expected to continue to support these efforts and believed formmaker had a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there was risk associated with the completion of the projects and there was no assurance that any would reach either technological or commercial success 
if these projects were not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company could have been adversely affected in future periods 
subsequent to the merger  the majority of the original r d projects were completed in accordance with formmaker s plans 
the fruition of these projects resulted in advanced new product technologies represented by the launch of the internet document server ids versions and  bill print version and  which fueled the release of two new dap products 
the emergence of the ids products represented the completion of a key revolutionary technology 
this new rules based transaction processing server  released in october  allows for the dynamic generation of documents in industry standard adobe pdf format for web delivery and the ability to archive documents in a pure thin client fashion 
the second phase of ongoing projects aimed at addressing new internet functionalities pushed forward the release of ids version in december  which further addressed new delivery mechanisms and standards such as microsoft s active x  microsoft s odbc  and sun microsystem s java and represents the completion of the in process r d acquired in the merger 
the company began recognizing revenue related to ids products during fiscal year formmaker s pre acquisition efforts in developing new printing technologies have resulted in the release of bill print versions and in october and march  respectively  which address the high volume complex bill and statement printing needs of the utilities industry 
formmaker s investments in developing innovative features  new workflow capabilities  object oriented desktop integration  multiple language system communications  improved graphics capabilities and platform and hardware adaptability proved fruitful in yielding new dap releases in september that could adequately address international markets and open new industries  such as utilities and financial services 
the release of bill print versions and and the new dap releases have contributed to a significant increase in revenues derived from the utilities market 
revenues in this market increased in excess of in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the previous fiscal year  and greater than and in each of the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
in addition  these releases of in process r d have resulted in recent licenses to the financial services industry 
most of the in process r d projects acquired in the merger were completed on schedule  but minor delays occurred due to changes in technological and market requirements for document automation processing and imaging systems 
although all in process r d projects have been completed  no assurance can be made that the company s recent releases will be met with market acceptance 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has responded to inquiries by the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the value ascribed to the technology acquired as in process r d in connection with the merger 
to date  the company has not received further inquiries from the sec 
however  depending upon the outcome of any future discussions with the sec  the company s historical reported results could potentially be subject to restatement to reflect a reduction of the in process r d charge 
a reduction of the in process r d charge would result in a corresponding increase in the amount of goodwill  which is being amortized over a ten year period 
liquidity and capital resources at july   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents for the year ended july  decreased approximately million due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets and purchase of treasury stock under the company s stock repurchase program  offset by approximately million of cash generated from operations 
cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million were related to the purchase of short term investments  development of capitalized software  and purchase of fixed assets 
specifically  the company invested approximately million in fixed assets primarily related to the company s opening of the dallas asp center  expanding the atlanta facilities  and purchase of asp hosting equipment 
cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million primarily relates to the purchase of treasury stock under the company s stock repurchase program offset by proceeds from exercise of stock options 
as of july   the company had approximately  shares of treasury stock outstanding at an average per share cost of 
since inception of the company s stock repurchase program in fiscal  the company has repurchased approximately  million shares of stock at an average purchase price of 
the company s board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of stock working capital was approximately million at july   compared with approximately million at july  the company s million revolving credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate less  or as of july   and has been renewed and extended to november under the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of july  there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
the company s liquidity needs are expected to arise primarily from funding the continued development  enhancement  and support of its software offerings  selling and marketing costs associated principally with expansion in new vertical and international markets  and purchase of treasury stock under the company s stock repurchase program 
although the company has no current commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses or technologies  a portion of the company s cash could be used to acquire complementary businesses or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
the company currently anticipates that existing cash  short term investments  its existing credit facility  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future
