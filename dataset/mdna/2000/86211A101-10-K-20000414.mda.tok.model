loss on investment in august   the company acquired  in conjunction with another investor  ownership of a new product technology developed by a former customer the developer 
the transfer of ownership was effected through a series of transactions 
during the third quarter the company reclassified a delinquent account receivable to a long term asset in its financial statement and entered negotiations to secure the debt 
in march  the parties agreed to convert the account receivable to convertible preferred stock 
when the developer failed to file a timely registration statement the company surrendered that stock and entered into new negotiations 
in return for additional cash advances made by the company and the other investor  the ownership of the technology was transferred 
the developer was granted an exclusive license to manufacture the new product and the purchase and sale agreement provided for royalty payments to the purchasers 
subsequently  the developer ceased doing business which caused the company to terminate the license agreement 
at the end of  the company wrote down its investment on this asset to  additional significant resources would have been required to continue research and development on the new product technology  and to bring it to market 
the company did not have the additional resources to enter such business at that time 
citing the costs  the previous write down of such asset s value to a nominal amount and the potential for a long delay in recovering the value of the investment and the associated risks of such delay  the company sold the technology for  in other income expense other income expense aggregated   and  in the years  and  respectively 
the major component of other income expense is interest expense  which increased from to  as the result of increased short term borrowing under the company s line of credit

foreign currency transactions management does not currently utilize any derivative products to hedge its foreign currency risk 
the company s foreign subsidiaries obligations to their parent are denominated in united states dollars 
there is a potential for a foreign currency gain or loss based upon fluctuations between the united states dollar and its subsidiaries functional currencies  currently the german mark and the british pound 
this exposure is limited to the period between the time of accrual of such liability to the parent in the subsidiaries functional currency and the time of its payment 
other than the intercompany balances noted above  the company does not believe it has material unhedged monetary assets  liabilities or commitments which are denominated in a currency other than the operations functional currency 
management expects such exposure to continue until its foreign subsidiaries reach a more mature level of operation 
management currently has no plans to utilize any derivative products to hedge its foreign currency risk 
the euro conversion during  the company investigated the impact of the euro conversion on its subsidiaries in the united kingdom and in germany 
because germany is a participating country  the company purchased accounting software in order to accommodate the dual currency requirements for the transition period 
the purchase of that software was accounted for in accordance with the company s accounting policy for asset capitalization 
the company does not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on its business or its financial condition 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operations 
factors that may affect future results the company s stock price is volatile the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors quarterly variations in its operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community failure to meet earning expectations in addition  the company s stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the company s performance 
further  until recently  the company s stock was thinly traded 
because of these factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
the company s business may suffer if it cannot protect its intellectual property the company generally relies upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain the company s proprietary rights in its technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of the company s proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect its proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct its business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
intellectual property rights the company is aggressively pursuing the enforcement of its intellectual property rights after an extensive patent review conducted in subsequently  the company retained a major law firm to enforce these rights against infringing parties  which management believes to be extensive 
despite the company s and its legal representatives efforts  there can be no assurance or predictability as to any amount of recovery or the length of time it will take the company to recover any royalties or license fees which may be recoverable 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  unauthorized use may still occur  particularly in foreign countries 
development of new products and solutions the company must make continuous investment in research and development to maintain its ongoing effort to continually improve its products and provide innovative solutions to its customers 
the development of software products is a difficult and costly process and subject to many other products requirements 
the company s inability to timely deliver new products in the past has had an adverse effect on the company s operating and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively develop new products in the future 
competition the company competes with many established companies in the computer storage and server industries and certain of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by its competitors  including hardware  software and services  price reductions of its competitors equipment or services and the implementation of effective marketing strategies by its competitors 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer storage and server markets and have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which the company cannot foresee 
the company currently believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on the company s earnings 
rapid technological changes the computer industry is changing both dramatically and rapidly 
the development of open systems computing  the introduction of the internet  new fibre technologies san and the increasing storage density in disk drive technologies  have caused an increase in new product development and shorter time to bring the new products to market 
while the company believes that its virtual storage architecture and storagesuite products are advanced when compared to competitive products  and compliment many other products utilized in total customer solutions  there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future 
the failure to remain consistently ahead of competitive technologies would have a negative impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
business alliances many companies are forming business alliances with their competitors  to be able to provide totally integrated storage solutions to their customers 
one result of these alliances is to effectively preclude competitive products from being offered to the customers 
many of the relationships are exclusive and the company s failure to develop similar relationships will effectively reduce the number of qualified sales opportunities the company will have for its products in the future 
the company believes that it addresses this issue by its return to the reseller channel sales model and having the integrator solution providers value added resellers perform the solution selling required 
the company s failure to open these sales channels will have a negative effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
operations the company s products operate near the limits of electronic and physical performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing were to occur by the company or its suppliers  the company could experience a rate of failure in its products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to the company s reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities and control of material and manufacturing quality and costs are critical factors in the future growth of the company 
the company frequently revises and updates manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes to its products and evaluates the reallocation of manufacturing resources among its facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for its products will be sufficient to permit the company to avoid a rate of failure in its products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to the company s reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  most companies in the high technology arena are under pressure to be able to acquire and retain the services of talented individuals 
at present  there is a shortage in the number of qualified employees who are available  creating a lucrative job market for qualified and talented high tech employees 
the company has had a decline in revenue in each of the two previous years and comparable reduction in its work force 
while the company believes that it has the required core personnel to effectively manage and grow the company  there can no assurance that key employees may leave the company in the future 
the failure to maintain key employees could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results in the future 
liquidity and working capital the company s continued success depends on maintaining adequate liquidity and working capital to meet its operational requirements 
given the recent volatility in the securities markets and  in particular  the securities of technology companies  there can be no assurances that anticipated investors investments in the company will close and that the company will receive additional equity financing 
the failure of the company to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital could have a material adverse impact on the company 
failure of suppliers to provide quality products the company purchases several sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components and power supplies 
the company has experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet its quality and delivery requirements 
if any of its suppliers were to fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for its products  the company could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  the company periodically transitions its product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning its customers smoothly to new technologies  along with its historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet its delivery or quality requirements will have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and earnings 
changes in laws  regulations or other conditions that could adversely impair the company s condition the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if any laws  regulations or standards  both foreign and domestic  relating to the company or its products were newly implemented or changed 
litigation that the company may become involved in may adversely affect the company in the ordinary course of business  the company may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause the company to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a
