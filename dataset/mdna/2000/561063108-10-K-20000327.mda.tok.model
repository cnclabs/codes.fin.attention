impact of recently adopted accounting standards in december  the sec issued sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements which addresses the proper recognition of certain revenue items including contingent percentage rents 
certain of the company s leases contain provisions whereby additional rent is due from a tenant once the tenant has achieved a certain sales level ie contingent rental 
under sab no 
 a lessor should not recognize contingent rental income until the changes in the factor s on which the contingent lease payments is are based actually occur 
the company had previously recorded accrued percentage rental income as lessee s specified sales targets were met or achievement of the sales target was probable 
the company has elected to adopt the provisions of sab no 
in the fourth quarter  effective january  the cumulative effect of such adoption is a reduction in percentage rental revenue of approximately  as of january  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective for fiscal year beginning after june  this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company is evaluating the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
year date conversion certain computer systems that have time sensitive programs may not properly recognize the year which could result in major system failures or miscalculations 
in  the company developed a high level plan to address the risks posed by the year issues which included the testing of internal systems and inquiry of third parties with which the company conducts business including major tenants  vendors  contractors and creditors 
while the company had a year contingency plan in place as part of its final year plan  it did not experience any year related business interruptions that are known at this time 
management feels that there is a reasonably low level of risk that the company will experience any significant collateral year related problems that have not materialized to date 
the company would generally expect to manage business interruption relating to year issues that may still occur in a manner similar to other potential interruption issues encountered in the regular course of business 
the company intends to execute contingency plans as necessary as the year progresses 
however  the contingency plans are expected to provide relief only for short periods after which there could be an interruption in or failure of  the company s normal business activities that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity and financial condition 
funds from operations management considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity real estate investment trust 
the company calculates ffo as prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  as further clarified in a opinion paper  which utilizes net income or loss excluding gains and losses from sales of property and debt restructuring  further adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and other nonrecurring items 
it is the opinion of management that reduction for  or inclusion of these items  is not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate which  in general  has historically not depreciated 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  including distributions 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or the ability to pay distributions but rather  as a supplemental tool to be used in conjunction with these factors in analyzing the company s overall performance 
the company reports ffo on both a basic and diluted basis 
the diluted basis assumes the conversion of the company s convertible debentures and convertible notes into shares of common stock as well as other common stock equivalents including those which are antidilutive to earnings per share 
the following table shows the components that comprise the company s ffo for each of the three years ended december  the computation of ffo for has been restated to conform with the and presentation 
year ended december  in thousands net income   depreciation and amortization depreciation of buildings and improvements    amortization of tenant allowances and improvements amortization of leasing costs gain on sale of real estate  impairment of real estate loss on extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of change in accounting principle funds from operations  basic    interest expense on convertible securities    amortization of deferred financing costs on convertible securities funds from operations  diluted    weighted average shares outstanding basic    diluted    diluted  assuming conversion of convertible securities    liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations is the principal source of capital to fund the company s ongoing operations
