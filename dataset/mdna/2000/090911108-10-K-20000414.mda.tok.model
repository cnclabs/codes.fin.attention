this represents a dramatic increase over sales for october and november  bringing total fourth quarter sales to  increased sales during december are attributable to initial domestic market acceptance of the millennium  more aggressive marketing through the company s expanded domestic sales force and the addition of new international distributors

gross profit margins attributable to the millennium were still below desired levels in and remain below desired levels into the company expects to realize improved margins on its millennium sales during through improved production layouts  other production efficiencies and lower cost of materials 
gross profit in was adversely affected by a  increase in the inventory reserve related to the termination of the active marketing of the company s prior generation of laser based systems 
operating expenses  net of write off of purchased research and development costs  increased  or  to  in  compared to  in sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in  compared to  reported in the increase was due mainly to greater participation by the company at various dermatological and dental trade shows  payroll and other costs associated with the company s establishment of a domestic sales force  its continued pursuit of qualified international distributors  and the initial sales efforts associated with the introduction of lazersmile

the assets acquired relate primarily to the proprietary laser based technology being developed by lsti for non invasive laser treatment in the field of aesthetic skin rejuvenation  including all intellectual property rights consisting of patents  patent applications  a trademark application and certain know how 
at the time of the acquisition  the intellectual property embodying this developmental effort represented substantially all of lsti s assets  and the developmental efforts did not appear applicable to any alternative use 
as consideration for the assets acquired  the company issued to lsti an aggregate  shares of the company s common stock the shares  including  shares of common stock retained by the company pending the achievement by the business of specified performance objectives the performance shares 
pursuant to a separate agreement  the company also issued  shares of its common stock to o donnell eye centers  inc oeci  a missouri corporation  in consideration for the license of technology that is the subject of a pending patent application

interest income decreased  to  in  compared to  in this decrease reflects lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and interest bearing marketable securities 
interest expense increased  to  in  compared to  in  due to the existence of borrowings under a line of credit during the entire period as compared to only one month during financial condition the company s working capital requirements have been financed over the past several years through the private placement of the company s equity securities

subsequent to the company s year end  proceeds in excess of  were received from the exercise of certain stock purchase warrants and stock options

the reduction in inventory was partially offset by an  provision for obsolete inventory charged in to transition from the company s previous millennium laser system version to its recently introduced millennium ii version 
the company believes that through its operations involved primarily research and development while awaiting key regulatory clearances and that accordingly its operations did not reflect normal business cycles  so that information about inventory turns would not have been meaningful 
the company believes that such information should become meaningful once a pattern of deliveries of millennium systems has been established 
prepaid assets decreased  in compared to due principally to the amortization of prepaid directors and officers liability insurance related to a year premium paid in liability under a line of credit established in december to finance inventory decreased  from to this decrease is a net result of draw downs against the line aggregating  offset by payments made to the line of  the balance available for future inventory purchases  should the need arise  is  the line of credit is due to expire december  the aggregate of accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  in compared to this increase is attributable principally to i higher payroll related accruals associated with the company s increased staffing  ii greater warranty level reserves required given the sales growth experienced during  and iii an accrual for  in estimated costs associated with the reacquisition of distribution rights in germany

the company also recognized a  charge to operating expenses representing the carrying value of certain engineering molds that are no longer of use 
patents  trademarks and licenses in decreased  from reflecting principally the amortization of the intangible assets for other assets increased  in compared to due principally to a deposit placed with an injection mold manufacturer for the creation of molds for the millennium ii laser system 
stockholders equity at december  was in a deficit position of  compared to an equity position of  at december  the deficit position in was created by the net loss of  partially offset by i equity fundings related to a private placement of the company s common stock and the exercise of stock purchase warrants and options of  and  respectively  and ii a  increase to stockholders equity representing the extension of stock option terms related to a severance agreement with a former executive officer 
subsequent to december   the company completed a private placement of  shares of restricted common stock and  stock purchase warrants for net proceeds of  the company executed an agreement with the former shareholders of lsti whereby  of the  shares of the company s common stock issued as consideration for the assets of lsti are to be returned to the company for subsequent cancellation 
the agreement also calls for the cancellation of the  shares of the company s common stock held in escrow for issuance to lsti based on future performance of the technology purchased from lsti 
see item i  description of business acquisition of laser skin toner  inc liquidity and capital resources the company remains dependent upon its ability to obtain outside financing either through the issuance of additional shares of its common or preferred stock or through borrowings until it achieves sustained profitability through increased sales and cost containment 
the company s business continues to focus on the manufacturing and marketing of its laser based hydrokinetic tissue cutting system  the millennium ii and its new diode laser product  the twilite 
financing the development of laser based medical and dental devices and instruments and the operations of the company has been achieved principally through the private placements of preferred and common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants  though the company has experienced significant increased sales of its millennium system during during the three years ended december   the company raised approximately  of net equity funds in this manner 
prior to certain equity funding  management believed that the company required significant resources in  principally to fund the company s working capital needs to support the production and marketing of the company s laser based products for various dental and medical applications  efforts directed towards further extensions and refinements of existing products  and continuing research and development activities 
based upon the company s private placement subsequent to december   as more fully discussed below  the company believes that it should have sufficient capital resources to sustain it for the next months in relation to its fiscal year business plan 
should the company require further capital resources in fiscal year  the company would most likely address such requirement through a combination of the sales of its products  sale of equity securities in private placements  and or debt financings 
no assurances can be given  however  that the company would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
if the company is required to raise additional capital in fiscal year and is unable to do so  the company might attempt to preserve its available resources by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scaling back its operations 
if the company were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  it would have an adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  cash flows and prospects of the company and ultimately on its ability to continue as a going concern 
subsequent to december   the company completed a private placement in which it issued  shares of its restricted common stock to institutional investors and  redeemable stock purchase warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire march  and allow for the company to call the warrants  with not less than days written notice  at a redemption price of 
each  provided that the average between the high and low prices at which the shares of common stock trade in the principal market in which they then trade exceeds of the exercise price for twenty consecutive trading days preceding the date of such call 
gross proceeds received from the private placement were approximately  net proceeds  after placement agent cash commissions and expenses of approximately  and estimated expenses incurred by the company of  were approximately  subsequent to december   the company also received proceeds of approximately  representing the aggregate exercise price of certain outstanding stock purchase warrants and stock options 
at december   the company had  outstanding under a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  for the financing of inventory and is collateralized by substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and inventories 
the interest rate is fixed throughout the term of the credit agreement and is computed based upon libor plus at the time of any borrowings 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance was 
the company is required to reduce the outstanding loan balance by an amount equal to the cost of goods sold associated with sales of inventory upon collection of sales proceeds 
the current revolving credit agreement expires on december  at which point the company will be required to either pay any remaining balance of the credit facility or refinance the credit facility 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to refinance the line of credit or that the terms on which it may be able to refinance the line of credit will be as favorable as the terms of the existing line 
if the company is unable to refinance and is therefore required to repay the line of credit  the diversion of resources to that purpose may adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
impact of changing prices on sales and income the company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation on production and operating costs through cost control programs and productivity improvements 
over the past three years  the inflation rate has been relatively low 
nonetheless  the company has continued to experience increases in the cost of labor and some materials  in the face of requests for price reductions from customers 
due to competitive forces and market imposed selling price ceilings during  the company was not able to raise prices to its customers to pass along the cost increases experienced 
the company  however  shall continue to pursue price reductions from its materials vendors in an attempt to improve or maintain margins
