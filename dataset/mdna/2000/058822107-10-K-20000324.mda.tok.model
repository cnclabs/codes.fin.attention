item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity historically have been and are expected to continue to be cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under short term lines of credit 
the company increased its borrowing capacity under its domestic line of credit to million in the company also continues to have lines of credit in ecuador and europe totaling approximately million 
working capital and borrowing requirements increased in and are expected to continue to increase as a result of the company s expanded operations as a seafood importer as well as organic growth in its core material business 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded by a combination of cash generated from operations and outside financing  if necessary 
the company s financial position remains strong 
at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  cash was provided and used in varying amounts during the two year period  principally as a result of changes in the elements of current assets and current liabilities and in the amount of cash provided by net income 
inventories and accounts receivable increased in due to the company s expansion into the seafood import business 
the company s short term borrowings  which were used to finance higher working capital requirements  also increased in cash used in investing activities for the three year period was due to investments in balsa plantations  purchase of new equipment in addition to replacement of old equipment and structural improvements of the shrimp ponds 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company had unused lines of credit of approximately million with a domestic bank  approximately million with ecuadorian banks and approximately million with european banks for working capital purposes 
the company expects that future operations and its unused lines of credit will provide sufficient resources to support its planned expansion and maintain its favorable liquid position 
results of operations for the years ended december   and total sales increased  and in  and  respectively 
the gains in all three years were due to increased core materials and seafood sales 
core material sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the continued robust economy has resulted in strong demand in all industries that use core materials  including the company s largest customer group  the boating industry 
many of the company s end user markets  including boating  are highly cyclical 
demand within those industries is dependent upon  among other factors  discretionary income  inflation  interest rates and consumer confidence 
fluctuating interest rates and other changes in economic conditions make it difficult to forecast short or long range trends 
the increase in core material sales in compared to was attributable to higher pricing and volume 
seafood sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in was the result of sales of seafood products from the company s import business  which began in the first quarter 
the increases in and were the result of higher volume of shrimp shipped 
the overall gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased in and increased in and the typical margin in the seafood import business is lower than the company s historical margins realized as a core materials producer distributor and shrimp producer 
the overall margin was therefore expected to decline in as a result of the company s importing activities 
the margin for the company s core products remained approximately the same in after increasing in and the margins primarily improved due to improved pricing 
the margins from shrimp sales decreased in  and a virus  commonly called white spot disease  has affected shrimp farms in south america and other parts of the world 
this disease has resulted in lower revenues in because of lower production at the company s farms and the company is harvesting its production earlier smaller sizes sell for less per pound than larger sizes 
there has also been increased volatility in shrimp prices in as compared to lower revenues have resulted in a lower gross margin for as compared to the company is taking all possible steps to mitigate the effect of this disease on its farms  but since other farms in south america are effected  no determination can be made as to its longevity and effect on shrimp prices in the marketplace 
the gross margin from shrimp sales decreased in and the decrease in margins in and is attributable to a higher volume of shrimp purchased from outside suppliers  which have lower margins than shrimp grown at the company s own farms 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in  and the seafood import business  which began during the first quarter of  has a lower percentage of s  g a expenses to revenues as compared to the company s historical relationship 
this  as expected  reduced s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales 
the decline in all years  but primarily and  was due to a better absorption of fixed expenses  primarily general and administrative expenses  as a result of increased sales 
sales and expenses were affected in all three years by the different exchange rates applied in translating the books of accounts of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense decreased in after increasing in and in  the company s short term borrowings for working capital purposes in ecuador were primarily us dollar denominated loans 
sucre based loans were available on a limited basis during much of in  the company borrowed money for working capital purposes in ecuador in local currency sucre denominated loans 
the sucre based loans bear higher interest rates than us dollar loans  which was partially offset by gains resulting from the devaluation of the sucre 
this practice increased interest expense in as compared to but created a corresponding foreign exchange gain 
the company s interest rate on us loans was lower in and its average borrowings were significantly higher in as compared to the level of borrowing in all periods is related to the company s working capital needs and cash flows generated from operations 
the company had a foreign exchange loss of  in compared to a gain in of  and a loss of  in gains were lower in due mainly to the company s shift from sucre based to dollar denominated loans described above 
translation gains and losses are mainly caused by the relationship of the us dollar to the foreign currencies in the countries where the company operates  and arise when translating foreign currency balance sheets into us dollars 
the company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain inventory purchases and may also employ certain strategies whose objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company has not and does not intend to enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
management is unable to forecast the impact of translation gains or losses on future periods due to the unpredictability in the fluctuation of foreign exchange 
the effective income tax rate amounted to in  in and in reconciliation of the effective rate with the us statutory rate is detailed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year the company experienced no major problems with its internal information technology it systems and non it systems  nor did it experience any problems with critical suppliers  customers and other third parties the company utilizes for various processing functions 
the costs of year compliance did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company or its suppliers may not face future problems as a result of year issues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices  foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials created in the normal course of business  the company enters into a limited number of derivative hedging transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
the deferred gains and losses on these instruments at december  were not material 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in addition  in order to hedge currency exposures related to the net investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company utilizes local currency and us dollar denominated financing entered into by the subsidiaries 
the company manages interest rate cost relating to these financings by using variable interest rates 
although the use of variable interest rate bearing debt instruments has the potential for market risk  the company s overall interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended december  would not be materially affected by a near term change in interest rates
