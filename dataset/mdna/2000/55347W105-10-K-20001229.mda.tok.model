cost of support and services consists primarily of personnel costs for employees and the related costs of benefits and facilities

also contributing to the increase in fiscal were provisions for bad debt to cover doubtful foreign receivables 
the days sales outstanding for september  were days  which was above the company s targeted range of to days 
the increase in goodwill amortization expense in fiscal is attributable to the acquisitions of businesses completed during the year 
in february  the company acquired the arm group inc the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired consisted of purchased in process product development and completed technology 
in the opinion of management  the purchased in process product development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the company recorded a non recurring charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
non operating expenses fiscal fiscal fiscal year year year ended change ended change ended in thousands interest income    interest expense other income expense loss on minority interest the increase in interest income in fiscal is attributable to interest earned on marketable securities and cash equivalents from cash flow generated from operations including accounts receivable collections 
the company liquidated a portion of its marketable securities in march in order to complete the purchase of intermat  inc and has thus earned less interest income from investments 
the company may decide to make further investments in marketable securities in the future 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was due to premiums amortized for purchased marketable securities 
in fiscal  the company obtained financing from a third party for a receivable due from the united states government  which is why interest expense was lower in fiscal as compared with fiscal other income for fiscal was primarily attributable to a gain recorded in the fourth quarter for the sale of short term investments 
the decrease in other expense in fiscal was attributable to income derived from the maximo users group conference  offset by foreign translation losses 
to date  the company has not engaged in currency hedging transactions 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in is mainly attributable to the effects of state income tax law 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to foreign tax credits and benefits from a foreign sales corporation 
the company s effective tax rate before a one time non deductible charge for purchased in process product development was in fiscal the income tax expense provided during fiscal reflects the non deductible nature of certain charges related to the acquisition of the arm group  inc liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  primarily attributable to income generated for the year  an increase in deferred revenue  an increase in deferred income taxes  an increase in accounts payable  offset by increases in income taxes payable and accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year totaled million  primarily due to acquisitions of businesses and property and equipment  offset by sales of marketable securities in order to complete the purchase of intermat  inc in the quarter ended march  cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million  resulting from proceeds received from exercises of employee stock options

the company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through june as of september   the company s subsidiary ait  had a  line of credit with a bank  which matures on july  the two notes bear interest at the bank s prime interest rate and the bank s prime interest rate plus  respectively

the company believes that its current cash balances and marketable securities combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least september  factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and statements made by authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives of the company  acting on its behalf  may include forward looking information which will be influenced by the factors described below  and by other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information is based on assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and future operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company including without limitation those identified by footnotes in the foregoing discussion are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may become inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company that related to such results and actions 
other factors  which are not identified herein  could also have such an effect 
rapid technological change the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
the company s success depends upon its ability to continue to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving customer requirements and industry standards  and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for new functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems  and that it must continue to create products that conform to industry standards regarding the communication and interoperability between software products of different vendors 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could result in a loss of competitiveness and revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements  or that the company will not experience significant delays in developing such new products or product enhancements 
such delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products and product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on maximo a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from the licensing of its maximo family of products and to related services and support 
revenues from licenses of maximo and related services and support accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues in fiscal  but declined in absolute dollar amount compared with fiscal the company s financial performance in depends largely on continued market acceptance of maximo  and the acceptance of its demand side e commerce procurement application maximo buyer 
the company believes that continued market acceptance of maximo will largely depend on its ability to enhance and broaden the capabilities of maximo by among other things  developing additional application modules and by developing and incorporating into the maximo product technologies that are emerging in connection with the internet 
any factor adversely affecting sales of maximo  such as delays in development  significant software flaws  incompatibility with significant hardware platforms  operating systems or databases  increased competition or negative evaluations of maximo  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
new products  new markets in the first quarter of fiscal  the company repositioned its mro 
com brand internet based business to business marketplace as mrodistributor  mromanufacturer and mroconnect  offering the suppliers of mro goods and services the ability to drive and control their internet based e commerce initiatives 
there can be no assurance that the company s supply side products will be sold successfully  or that the company s supply side products will achieve market acceptance 
there is also no assurance that the company and its customers will create a large enough community of sellers  connected to a large enough community of buyers  for the company to achieve leverage and market synergy between its demand side and supply side products 
the company s future success in the electronic commerce market may depend on its ability to accurately determine the functionality and features required by its customers  as well as the ability to enhance its supply side products and deliver them in a timely manner 
the company may incur substantial costs to enhance and modify its supply side products and services in order to meet the demands of this growing and changing market 
the company s supply side product segment is not yet profitable and may not be profitable for sometime 
maximo extended enterprise is now marketed to satisfy prospective customers e procurement requirements  and its pricing has been changed from user based pricing to demand capacity pricing  where the customer purchases the right to process a certain number of transactions during the year 
there can be no assurance that this pricing model will be accepted in the market  and sales of maximo could be delayed or lost if the company has to change its pricing model 
maximo buyer is also offered to non maximo customers who wish to engage in e procurement 
the internet e procurement market is a nascent market that may undergo rapid technological change and rapid influx of competing technologies and vendors 
the company cannot predict the present and future size of the potential market for its maximo extended enterprise and maximo buyer products  or whether the demand side products will achieve acceptance in that market 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results  which may negatively impact the price of our stock 
the company s revenues and income from operations typically grow at a lower rate or decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year  compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding fiscal year 
in addition  revenues are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters of the year 
the company believes that these quarterly patterns are partly attributable to the company s sales commission policies  which compensate members of the company s direct sales force for meeting or exceeding annual quotas 
in addition  the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
the company typically realizes a significant portion of its revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of a quarter  frequently even in the last days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company generally ships its products upon receipt of orders and maintains no significant product backlog 
as a result  revenues from license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a delay in or loss of orders can cause significant variations in operating results 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is fixed in the short term  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
accordingly  if revenues do not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
competition the market for enterprise asset maintenance software such as maximo is fragmented by geography  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and is characterized by a large number of competitors including both independent software vendors and certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors 
independent software vendors include datastream  manugistics and indus 
maximo also competes with integrated erp systems which include integrated maintenance modules provided by several large vendors  such as sap  oracle and jd edwards and others 
currently  maximo competes with products of a number of large vendors  some of which have traditionally provided maintenance software running on mainframes and minicomputers and are now offering systems for use in the client server environment 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality to enter the client server market 
some of the companies mentioned above have also developed e procurement applications that are competitive with maximo buyer 
the company s supply side business has many diverse competitors offering a wide range of differing products  services and technologies 
the company expects competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
we may not remain competitive  and increased competition could seriously harm our business 
our competitors offer a variety of e business products that compete with ours including supply chain and other core supply side business 
we may compete with vendors who have established electronic marketplaces and indirect procurement capabilities  such as ariba and commerce one 
other competitive factors include internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments and companies offering customized products 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than the company 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  or on the industrial supply chain market  the company could be at a competitive disadvantage 
international operations a significant portion of the company s total revenues is derived from operations outside the united states 
the company derived   and of its total revenue from sales outside the united states in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company continues to invest in international infrastructure  global product functionality and translated versions of financial and other software products 
in the event international expansion and or product globalization efforts are not successful  the company s business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
this international business is subject to various risks common to international activities  including exposure to currency fluctuations  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  the greater difficulty of administering business abroad and the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import and united states export laws and regulatory requirements 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue is derived from international operations that are conducted in foreign currencies 
changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar have in the past adversely affected  and may in the future affect  the company s results of operations and financial position 
gains and losses on translation to united states dollars and settlement of receivables from international subsidiaries may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has not engaged in currency hedging transactions 
the company may in the future undertake currency hedging  although there can be no assurance that hedging transactions  if entered into  would materially reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
dependence on third parties the company has entered into nonexclusive license agreements with other third party software developers  pursuant to which the company incorporates into its products software providing certain application development  user interface  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these companies 
if the company were unable to renew these licenses or unable to renew them on commercially reasonable terms  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance its products  the company could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
the supply side operations  is dependent on digital island  a third party data center  which could be destroyed or damaged 
in addition  the company must stay on good terms with this vendor  and be able to renew its agreement with this vendor on commercially reasonably terms 
if this data center were to become inoperable or unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  the company would incur significant expense  and potentially lose its ability to provide these services altogether during the period of downtime and transition  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and market rejection of its supply side offerings 
the company s supply side operations are dependent upon the company s ability to protect computer equipment and the information stored in these third party data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disasters  fire  power loss  telecommunication or internet failures  unauthorized intrusions  computer viruses and other similar damaging events 
the company cannot assure that any of these damaging events would not result in a prolonged outage of the company s network services or that the company would not experience a reduction of revenues or unexpected expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
hosting the company does not have extensive experience in hosting applications 
we may not adequately predict the flow of traffic 
if we do not predict the volume of traffic adequately  we may experience slower response times or other problems 
any delays in response time or performance problems could cause our customers to perceive this service as not functioning properly and they may discontinue use of our products and services 
the company s success and profitability in its supply side business is dependent on the company s ability to increase the scaleability and performance of its supply side solutions  meaning that the company must be able to host and operate a large number of mrodistributor  mromanufacturer and mroconnect product instances on a single computer using multiple processors 
this is because the company incurs fixed costs associated with the hosting environment  regardless of how many  or how few  supply side products are hosted at the same time 
if the company is unable to host a certain number of supply side solutions per computer  then the supply side business may not become profitable for a long time 
moreover  if the company is not able to operate a large number of supply side product instances on the same computer without denigrating product performance  the supply side solutions may not gain customer acceptance and market penetration 
errors in data the company needs to publish accurate catalog data  as this is critical to our customers businesses 
our content management tools help suppliers manage the collection and publication of catalog content 
any defects or errors in these tools  or in the catalog data produced by using them  could deter businesses from utilizing our supply side solutions 
product development internet the company has developed a java based component architect software application to incorporate into the maximo product technologies emerging in conjunction with the internet 
internet technologies and applications generally are developing and gaining acceptance rapidly in the market 
mro supply chain management using electronic commerce is a nascent market with many standards and technologies remaining to be developed 
accordingly  developing technologies pose risks to the company 
the company believes that electronic commerce products and technologies complement the company s enterprise asset management products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully anticipate trends in this market  that the company will be successful in internet technology development or acquisition efforts or that the company s internet applications  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
internet related risks if internet usage continues to grow rapidly  its infrastructure may not be able to support customer and user demands and its performance and reliability may decline 
if outages  delays  or viruses on the internet occur frequently or increase in frequency  overall internet usage including usage of the company s products and services could grow more slowly or decline 
the company is dependent upon improvements being made to the entire internet as well as to particular customers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion 
if these improvements are not made  the ability of the company s customers to utilize the company s solution will be hindered  and the company s business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
limited intellectual property protection the company s success is dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company currently has one patent and protects its technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
the company s software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap or click wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging or acknowledged by customers who register on line 
although  in larger sales  the company s shrink wrap and click wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases its shrink wrap and click wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of the company s shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or development by others of similar technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any valid claim of any patent or any other proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could potentially have a material adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on certain key executive officers  technical and sales employees  the loss of one or more of who could have an adverse impact on the future operations of the company 
the company does not have employment contracts with  and does not maintain key person life insurance policies on  any personnel 
the company continues to hire a significant number of additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific domain expertise 
it is widely believed that the technology industry is at or beyond a condition of full employment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
certain risks associated with acquisitions as part of its overall strategy  the company plans to continue to acquire or invest in complementary companies  products  or technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in overcoming the risks associated or problems encountered in connection with such business combinations  investments  or joint ventures  or that such transactions will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or operating results 
possible continued volatility of stock price fiscal and was marked by significant fluctuations in the market price of the common stock  par value 
per share  of the company the common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its competitors and other third parties  as well as quarterly variations in the company s results of operations and market conditions in the industry  may cause the market price of the common stock to continue to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software and e commerce companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
effect of accounting pronouncements on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as ammended  summarizes some of the staff s interpretations of the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
all registrants are expected to apply the accounting and disclosure requirements that are described in sab by the fourth quarter of their fiscal year beginning after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its future financial statements 
no revisions or updates to forward looking statements the company has no obligation to release publicly any revision or update to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at september   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of taxable and tax exempt municipal securities 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity 
the company develops its products in the united states and markets them in north america  europe  middle east and africa  australia  asia pacific and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
currently  the company has no hedging contracts
