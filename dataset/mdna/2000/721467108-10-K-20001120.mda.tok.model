general profitability in the chicken industry can be materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken  chicken parts and feed ingredients 
those commodity prices are determined largely by supply and demand 
as a result  the chicken industry as a whole has been characterized by cyclical earnings 
these cyclical fluctuations in earnings of individual chicken companies can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared food products 
prepared food products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared food products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our us cost of goods sold in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production costs  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability

however  actual levels of capital expenditures in any fiscal year may be greater or lesser than those budgeted 
the company expects to finance such expenditures with available operating cash flows and long term financing

the company intends to finance the transaction with existing cash and borrowings under the financing facility described above  which will result in the company incurring substantially greater interest expense in the future 
the transaction has received the unanimous approval of both companies board of directors and is expected to be completed during january market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  the company from time to time will lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
the company does not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leverage derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of the company s primary feed ingredients as of september  based on projected feed consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million in as of september   the company had hedged none of its feed requirements and had entered into no forward purchase contracts 
foreign currency 
the company s earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of its mexico subsidiaries 
the company primarily manages this exposure by attempting to minimize its mexican peso net monetary position  but has also from time to time considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
however  such instruments have historically not been economically feasible 
the company is also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the united states 
however  the company currently anticipates that the cash flows of its mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in its mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact the company s results of operations and financial position in several manners  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of the company s mexico subsidiaries  were a gain of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and a loss of million in on november   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  a decrease from at september  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect future earnings of the company 
interest rates 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its variable rate debt instruments 
the company has variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of its long term debt at september  if interest rates average basis points more in than they did during  the company s interest expense would be increased by  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt at september market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million  using discounted cash flow analysis 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is required to be adopted by the company in its fiscal year beginning october  sfas will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation due to moderate inflation in the us and the company s rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period
