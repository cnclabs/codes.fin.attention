see note to the consolidated financial statements business segment information 
until december  euronet had devoted substantially all of its resources to establishing and expanding its atm network through the addition of atms to its proprietary network and through providing outsourced management solutions for bank owned atms 
on december   the company acquired arksys and for the year ended december   a significant portion of the company s revenues and expenses resulted from and are attributable to arksys operations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and the company s total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues from to is primarily due to two factors a million increase in atm services segment revenues resulting from the increase in transaction volume attributable to an increase in the number of atms operated by the company during this period  and the addition of million of arksys software solutions segment revenues 
the increase in revenues from to was due primarily to a million increase in atm services segment revenues due to an increase in transaction volume attributable to additional network connections to credit and debit card issuers 
revenues for the years ended december  and are discussed more fully in the segment results of operations sections below 
total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase from to can be broken down by segment as follows a million increase in atm services segment operating costs  the addition of million of arksys software solutions segment operating costs  and a million increase in corporate services segment operating costs 
the increase from to is due to increased expenditures resulting from the expansion of the atm network operations 
operating expenses for the years ended december  and are discussed more fully in the segment results of operations sections below 
the company generated an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increased operating loss from to is due to the net effect of three factors a million decrease in operating losses from the company s atm services segment  the addition of million in operating losses from the company s arksys software solutions segment  and a million increase in operating losses from the company s corporate services segment 
the increase from to is due to increased expenditures resulting from the expansion of the atm network operations

segment results of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands revenues operating loss year ended december  atm services     arksys software solutions    corporate services   inter segment eliminations total     atm services segment overview the company operates the only independent  non bank owned automated teller machine atm network in central and western europe  as a service provider to banks and other retail oriented financial institutions 
the atm services segment s principal source of revenue to date has been transaction and service fees from a growing number of atms installed in hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  france  germany  and the uk 
on march   the company expanded its proprietary network in germany by acquiring a network of installed atms and atms in inventory from service bank gmbh co 
kg service bank 
on august   the company purchased a interest in eft network services llc dash located in little rock  arkansas  usa 
the company had previously owned of dash as a result of its acquisition of arksys on december  the company now owns of dash 
see note to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions 
dash is an atm switch processing center 
the current operations of dash include processing transactions for approximately customer owned atms 
in addition  dash provides a platform for offering atm and related processing services to potential bank and non bank customers in the united states 
during the third quarter of  the company expanded its outsourced management solutions business in the us by executing a contract which provided for the sale of atms to dillard s department stores and the operation of such atms by the company under a service agreement 
the atms were sold to dillard s under a value added reseller agreement with the manufacturer of the machines 
the company arranged for the sale  delivery and installation of atms in august  atms in september and atms in october  recording hardware revenues of  net of all costs 
the company will operate these atms from the dash switch processing center in little rock 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the sale of its croatian network assets to raiffeisenbank austria rba for consideration of million 
the carrying value of the croatian network assets was million  resulting in a gain to the company of  recorded as an offset to operating costs 
subsequent to the sale of the network assets  the company and rba entered into an atm services agreement whereby the company will provide atm management and other related services to rba for an initial term of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements sale of croatian network 
as of december   the company owned or operated  atms  of which were owned by the company and were owned by banks and financial institutions but operated by the company through management agreements as a part of the company s outsourced management solutions business 
by comparison  as of december   the company s proprietary atm network totalled  atms  of which were owned by the company and were owned by banks and financial institutions 
the company believes the shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to a more balanced mix between proprietary atms and customer owned atms is an extremely positive development and will provide substantially higher marginal returns on investments 
the atm services segment derives substantially all of its revenues from atm transaction fees 
the company receives a fee from the card issuing banks or international card organizations for atm transactions processed on its atms 
the company continues to focus on expanding its network and installing additional atms  especially atms installed as part of the outsourced management solutions business where contracts may include flat monthly management fees or minimum transaction guarantees 
the company expects that transaction fees will continue to account for a substantial proportion of its atm services segment revenues for the foreseeable future even as its outsourced management solutions business expands 
the transaction volumes processed on an atm in any given market are affected by a number of factors  including location of the atm and the amount of time the atm has been installed at the location 
the company s experience has been that the number of transactions on a newly installed atm is initially very low and it takes approximately three to twelve months after installation to achieve average transaction volumes for that market 
accordingly  the average number of transactions  and thus revenues  per atm are expected to increase as the percentage of mature atms operating in the company s network increases 
the company has expanded its outsourced management solutions to include not only the operation of existing atms owned by banks  but also the installation and management of company owned atms for banks in their branches or off site locations 
both types of outsourced management agreements involve the operation of atms in return for monthly management fees or a guaranteed monthly level of transaction fees  ensuring a certain level of return for the company 
the company believes that revenues from these services will continue to increase in the future 
the company sells advertising on its network by displaying clients advertisements on its atm screens and receipts 
the company believes that advertising revenues may increase as it expands its network and continues to market this service 
in november  the company began to sell pre paid mobile telephone vouchers on its networks in hungary and poland 
this represents just one of the many new products and services that can be delivered to the consumer through the atm 
the company intends to implement further value added services on its atm network

corporate services segment overview the corporate services segment exists solely to support the activities of the atm services and arksys software solutions segments 
this segment performs general corporate  administrative and support functions including legal  corporate finance  treasury  investor relations and corporate communications services 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and atm services segment total segment revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is due primarily to the significant increase in transaction volume attributable to additional network connections to credit and debit card issuers and an increase in the number of atms operated by the company during these periods 
the company had  atms installed as of december   and processed million transactions for the year ended december  as of december   the company s proprietary atm network increased by  atms  or  to a total of  atms  of which are owned by the company and are owned by banks or other financial institutions but operated by the company through management agreements 
the company processed million transactions for the year ended december   an increase of million transactions  or  over the year ended december  transaction fees charged by the company vary for the three types of transactions that are currently processed on the company s atms cash withdrawals  balance inquiries and transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization 
transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction while transaction fees for the other two types of transactions are generally substantially less 
operating expenses total segment operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increases are due primarily to costs associated with the installation of significant numbers of atms and expansion of the company s operations during the period 
direct operating costs in the atm services segment consist primarily of atm installation costs  atm site rentals  and costs associated with maintaining atms  atm telecommunications  interest on network cash and cash delivery and security services to atms 
such costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in direct operating costs is primarily attributable to costs associated with operating the increased number of atms in the network during the periods 
also  intercompany allocations were made to charge the atm operations with transaction switching and bank connection fees associated with the operations central processing center in budapest 
these allocations totalled million for the year ended december  previously these costs were not allocated as a direct operating cost but were included as a component of selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating costs include a  gain realized in from the sale of the croatian network assets to raiffeisenbank austria see note to the consolidated financial statements sale of croatian network 
the components of direct operating costs for the years ended december  and were in thousands years ending december  atm communication   atm cash filling and interest on network cash   atm maintenance   atm site rental  atm installation transaction processing and atm monitoring  other   total direct operating expenses   as a percentage of atm network revenue  direct operating costs fell from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  if the internal processing center charge is removed the comparable figure for falls to 
segment salaries and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the year on year expenses reflect the continued expansion of the operations to western european markets with significantly higher labor costs than central europe as well as some increases in staff levels at the processing center required to maintain quality service in line with the rising transaction volumes 
as a percentage of atm services revenue  salaries and benefits fell from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs allocated to the atm services segment decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the cost decrease for the year ended december  results from the net effect of a million allocation of costs from the selling  general and administrative line of the budapest processing center to the operating cost line  as discussed above  and a  increase in costs associated with the expansion of the company s network operations 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increases are due primarily to the increase in the number of owned atms as discussed previously 
operating loss the atm services segment operating loss decreased to million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors discussed above 
arksys software solutions segment arksys was acquired by the company on december  financial information for the full year ended december  is not available in a form that is comparable to the company s arksys information  and information is therefore not provided 
arksys software solutions revenue revenues from the arksys software solutions segment totaled million before inter segment eliminations for the year ended december  arksys revenues are grouped into four broad categories software license fees  professional service fees  maintenance fees and hardware sales 
software licence fees are the initial fees charged by arksys for the licencing of its proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees are charged for customization  installation and consulting services provided to customers 
software maintenance fees are the ongoing fees charged to customers for the maintenance of the arksys software products 
hardware sales revenues are derived from the sale of computer products and are reported net of cost of sales 
for the year ended december   revenues from the four categories were as follows software license fees million  professional service fees million  maintenance fees million and hardware sales 
software sales backlog the company defines software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts which have been executed by the company and for which the company expects recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december  the revenue backlog was million  at march  the revenue backlog was million  at june  the revenue backlog was million  at september  the revenue backlog was million  and at december  the revenue backlog was million 
the increase in backlog from december  results principally from growth in arksys sales since the acquisition 
the decrease in backlog from march  and june  can be attributed to the company s efforts towards accelerating the delivery of software  in addition to a slower rate of purchasing by banks as they allocated resources to short term operational issues related to year compliance 
the company expects this factor may negatively impact recognized revenue in the first quarter and into the second quarter of it is management s intention to continue to focus on expediting delivery and implementation of software in an effort to reduce backlog while continuing sales growth 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period 
operating expenses arksys software solutions segment operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  selling  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december  since the acquisition of arksys in december  the company has made planned increases in arksys s staff in order to increase sales  accelerate development of certain software enhancements and reduce delivery times for software 
these staff increases have resulted in a significant increase in salaries and benefits at arksys  which has contributed to the net losses of the arksys software solutions segment for the year ended december  the company has an ongoing commitment to the development  maintenance and enhancement of its products and services 
as a result of this commitment the company has invested substantial amounts in research and development 
the company s research and development costs incurred for computer products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed totaled million for of this total figure   was capitalized in conjunction with the company s accounting policy requiring the capitalization of development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when the company has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
operating loss the arksys software solutions segment incurred an operating loss of million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
corporate services segment operating expenses operating expenses for the corporate services segment increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the company s expansion of its network infrastructure  and increases in corporate and administrative capabilities are the primary reasons for these increased expenditures 
non operating results interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and increased from million for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of the decrease in investment securities and cash as a result of negative cash flow from operations and capital expenditures 
the increase from to is the result of increased investing activities related to the proceeds from the company s notes payable 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase is the result of accretion of the company s notes payable for a full year in in comparison to months accretion in and none in the increase from to is the result of accretion of the company s notes payable 
foreign exchange gain loss the company had a net foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december   and a net foreign exchange gain of  for the year ended december  exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of certain company assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net loss 
a portion of the assets and liabilities of the company are denominated in euros  including capital lease obligations  notes payable including the notes issued in the company s public bond offering  cash and cash equivalents  investments  and forward foreign exchange contracts 
it is the company s policy to attempt to match local currency receivables and payables 
the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities give rise to foreign exchange gains and losses as a result of us dollar to local currency exchange movements 
since issuing its deutsche mark denominated senior discount notes the senior discount notes in june  the company has hedged exposure resulting from foreign currency fluctuations that could affect the us dollar equivalent of the amounts payable under such notes 
on may   the company entered into several foreign exchange option contracts governed by an isda master agreement with merrill lynch international bank limited ml designed to protect the company against fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar 
under such contracts  if as of may  the settlement date under such contracts  the euro has weakened against the dollar and falls below to the euro the floor rate the company will be required to make a cash payment to ml on may  in an amount that will depend on the dollar euro exchange rate on such settlement date 
at the same time  if the euro has strengthened against the us dollar and rises above to the euro the ceiling rate the company will receive a cash payment from ml on may  in an amount that will depend on the dollar euro exchange rate on such settlement date 
the euro fell to below the floor rate for the first time in november and has fluctuated both above and below such rate since that time 
as of december  the rate of the euro was and the amount of cash on deposit with ml as collateral for the company s payment obligation under the foreign exchange option contracts was million 
as of march   the rate of the euro was and the amount of cash on deposit with ml as collateral was million 
the amount of the collateral on deposit corresponds approximately to the payment obligation that the company would incur under such option contracts as of the time the amount of collateral is established 
on march   the company entered into a put option that will mitigate the cash cost under the original option contracts resulting from a fall of the euro below 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements forward foreign exchange contracts and financial instruments 
extraordinary gain in the company recorded an extraordinary gain of million net of income taxes of following its repurchase of a portion of its senior discount notes

net loss the company s net loss increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has sustained negative cash flows from operations and has financed its operations and capital expenditures primarily through the proceeds from the issue of deutsche mark denominated notes payable  the company s public equity offering  equipment lease financing and private placements of equity securities 
the net proceeds of such transactions  together with revenues from operations and interest income have been used to fund aggregate net losses of approximately million  investments in property  plant and equipment of approximately million and acquisitions of million 
at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
the company had million of restricted cash held as security with respect to cash provided by banks participating in euronet s atm network  to cover guarantees on financial instruments and as deposits with customs officials

in addition to the assets held on the balance sheet at december  the company held repurchased notes payable with a face value of million deutsche marks million and a fair value at december  of million see note to consolidated financial statements financial instruments 
as of february  the company entered into subscription agreements for the sale of an aggregate of  new common shares of the company for a price of 
the company is in active discussions with another private placement investor to subscribe for an additional  common shares on the same terms and expects execution of an agreement relating to such placement by march these agreements were signed with certain accredited investors and foreign persons in transactions exempt from registration under the united states securities act of pursuant to exemptions under section and regulation d and regulation s of the act 
closing is expected to occur on march  with respect to the  shares for which subscription agreements have already been executed and on march with respect to the additional  shares with respect to which the subscription agreement is not yet executed 
if such transactions are closed as expected  the transactions will generate  in net proceeds to the company 
under each of these agreements  for each two shares of common stock purchased in the private placement  the purchaser will be issued a warrant  exercisable upon issuance and expiring months from the date of the signature of each agreement  to purchase one share of euronet common stock at an exercise price of 
the company leases the majority of its atms under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per annum 
as of december  the company owed million under such capital lease arrangements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements leases 
at december   the company had contractual capital commitments of approximately  for the purchase of atms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments 
the company expects that its capital requirements will continue in the future but will not be as great as they were in the past  as the company intends to continue to promote its outsourcing capabilities and re deploy under performing atms currently operating in the network 
this strategy should reduce the company s reliance on capital expenditures in the future as the business continues to grow 
fixed asset purchases and capital lease payments for are expected to be approximately million in the company s existing markets  notably western and central europe 
acquisitions of related atm business and investments in new markets in furtherance of the company s strategy may require additional capital expenditures 
based on the company s current business plan and financial projections  the company expects to continue to reduce operating losses and net cash used in operating activities in in the atm services segment  the company anticipates that increased transaction levels in its atm network will result in additional revenues without a corresponding increase in expenses 
in addition  the company expects to further expand its atm outsourcing services and offer new value added services  which will provide continued revenue growth without significantly increasing direct operating expenses or capital investments 
in the arksys software solutions segment  the company expects increased revenues resulting from sales of new products and services to the existing and expanded customer base resulting from the continued integration of the arksys and euronet sales and customer service organizations 
the company believes that the net proceeds from the private placement of common shares described above and cash and cash equivalents will provide the company with sufficient capital until it achieves positive cash flow 
as a result  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to meet current and future cash requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that the company will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows in any future period 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents the decrease of cash and cash equivalents to million at december  from million at december  is due primarily to the net effects of working capital movements  foreign exchange gains and losses  the acquisition of a network of installed and inventoried atms from service bank for million  capital expenditures and capital lease payments  repurchase of notes payable and warrants and operating losses for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements reconciliation of net loss to net cash used in operating activities and the consolidated statements of cash flows 
restricted cash restricted cash decreased to million at december  from million at december  the majority of restricted cash was held as security with respect to cash provided in hungary by banks participating in euronet s atm network  to cover guarantees for financial instruments and as deposits with customs officials 
the decrease represents a reduction in the amount of cash held as security with respect to cash provided in hungary by banks participating in euronet s atm network  and devaluation of the hungarian forint and polish zloty 
trade accounts receivable trade accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  is due primarily to sales from the arksys software solutions segment and increased atm revenues 
property  plant and equipment net property  plant and equipment increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due primarily to the installation of atms  the service bank acquisition and the acquisition of computer equipment as the network expands  offset by the sale of the croatian network

impact of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge in one of three categories described in the pronouncement 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
under sfas  an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
sfas applies to all entities and was originally effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  initial application should be as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal quarter  on that date  hedging relationships must be designated and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas earlier application of all of the provisions is encouraged but is permitted only as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after issuance of sfas additionally  sfas should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
management believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which changed the effective adoption of sfas to financial years beginning after june  forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document  including  without limitation  statements regarding i the company s business plans and financing plans and requirements  ii trends affecting the company s business plans and financing plans and requirements  ii trends affecting the company s business  v the adequacy of capital to meet the company s capital requirements and expansion plans  vi the assumptions underlying the company s business plans  vii business strategy  viii government regulatory action  ix technological advances and x projected costs and revenues  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may materially differ from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including technological and business developments in the local card and electronic banking markets affecting the transaction and other fees which the company is able to charge for its services  foreign exchange fluctuations  competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services and software providers  the company s relationships with its major customers  sponsor banks in various markets and international card organization  and changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business 
these risks  and other risks are described elsewhere in this document and the company s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure in  of the company s revenues were generated in poland and hungary  as compared to in and in the figure has been substantially reduced with the additional revenues from arksys and the company s expanded atm network in germany 
in hungary the majority of revenues received are denominated in hungarian forint and in poland  the majority of revenues are denominated in polish zloty 
however the majority of these foreign currency denominated contracts are linked either to inflation or the retail price index 
while it remains the case that a significant portion of the company s expenditures are made in or are denominated in us dollars the company is also striving to achieve more of its expenses in local currencies to match its revenues 
the company estimates that a further depreciation in foreign exchange rates of the deutsche mark  hungarian forint  and polish zloty against the us dollar  would have the combined effect of a million decrease in the reported net loss 
this was estimated using of the company s net losses after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items including us dollar denominated or indexed expenses 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or the company s financing or operating strategies 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the deutsche mark  as opposed to the us dollar  on the central european currencies  the company expects that the currencies of the markets where it invests will fluctuate less against the deutsche mark than against the dollar 
accordingly  the company believes that its deutsche mark denominated debt provides  in the medium to long term  for a closer matching of assets and liabilities than would dollar denominated debt 
since issuing its deutsche mark denominated senior discount notes the senior discount notes in june  the company has hedged exposure resulting from foreign currency fluctuations that could affect the us dollar equivalent of the amounts payable under such notes

inflation and functional currencies in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the oecd over this time period 
however  due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  none of these countries are considered to have a hyper inflationary economy 
further  the majority of all three subsidiaries revenues are denominated in the local currency 
thus all three subsidiaries use their local currency as the functional currency 
the polish and czech subsidiaries changed their functional currency to the respective local currency as of january  and january   respectively  and the hungarian subsidiary changed as of july  germany  france and the united kingdom have experienced relatively low and stable inflation rates in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia  like germany and france  has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of the croatian company is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to the factors mentioned above  the company does not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company continually reviews inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries that it operates in
