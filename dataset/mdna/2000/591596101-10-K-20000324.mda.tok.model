item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from subscriptions paid to us by users of our current ricochet service  which we offer in a limited number of markets  and from the sale of customer owned networks and related products to companies primarily engaged in utility businesses 
since  we have concentrated our efforts primarily on completing the development and testing of the technology necessary to deliver our high speed service  acquiring rights of way and other rights necessary for us to deploy our high speed network  establishing manufacturing relationships for network components and wireless modems and supporting the subscribers to our current ricochet service 
after we launch our high speed service  planned to occur during the late summer of  we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from subscription fees paid to us by channel partners  which will resell our service directly to their customers 
in connection with the launch of our high speed service  we expect to sell our existing subscriber accounts to one or more of our channel partners  and we will curtail our business operations related to our current ricochet service 
as we deploy our high speed network and launch our high speed service  we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly from historical levels and to exceed revenues for the foreseeable future 
we expect to generate substantial net losses to common stockholders for the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated a significant portion of our revenues from sales of customer owned networks and related products  known as utilinet  to utility companies 
in february  in order to focus our operations on deployment of our high speed network  we entered into an agreement to license our utilinet technology to schlumberger resources management services  inc the agreement grants schlumberger resources the exclusive right to design  manufacture and sell utilinet products in return for license and royalty fees 
we do not expect utilinet to be a significant source of revenues in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues service revenues product revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of service revenues provision for network replacement cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative provision for overall wireless total costs and expenses loss from operations interest expense interest income  net net loss preferred dividends net loss attributable to common stockholders year ended december  compared with year ended december  currently  we derive revenues from the sale of our services and products 
we derive service revenues from ricochet subscriber fees  ricochet modem rentals and utilinet customer support fees  and we recognize these revenues ratably over the service period 
we derive product revenues from the sale of utilinet products and ricochet modems  and we recognize these revenues upon shipment 
total revenues increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in service revenues 
service revenues increased to million in from million in  reflecting an increase in ricochet service revenues to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher aggregate subscriber fees resulting from an approximate increase in the number of ricochet subscribers in product revenues increased to million in from million in  principally as a result of increased shipments of utilinet products 
this increase was offset in part by a decline in ricochet product revenues to million in from million in  reflecting reductions in shipments of ricochet modems in the second half of compared with the second half of a significant portion of utilinet product revenues was derived from sales to southern california edison  which accounted for and of total product revenues in and  respectively 
utilinet revenues in total increased to million in from million in as a result of increased shipments of utilinet products 
we expect utilinet revenues to decline significantly in the future as a result of our focus on the launch of our high speed service 
in the future  in connection with the launch of our high speed service  we expect to sell our existing subscriber accounts to one or more of our channel partners  and we will curtail our business operations related to our current ricochet service 
we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenues from subscription fees paid to us by channel partners 
we anticipate that our channel partners will pay us subscription fees based on flat rates for each user they enroll for our service 
we will require each of our channel partners to charge its subscribers a flat rate for use of our service  although each channel partner will set the particular rate it charges its customers 
we currently have one channel partner relationship 
in june  mci worldcom entered into an agreement with us to sell our high speed service to its customers 
under that agreement  mci worldcom has agreed to pay us a per subscriber fee  subject to an agreed minimum revenue level of at least million over the five years following the launch of our service  assuming that our deployment schedule is not delayed  that we place our network into service on schedule and that we meet quality of service and network performance standards 
subject to these limitations  we currently expect mci worldcom to pay us the following minimum amounts during the first five years after we launch our service first year million second year million third year million fourth year million fifth year million notwithstanding the foregoing  if mci worldcom s sales efforts result in fewer subscribers than mci worldcom has agreed contractually to provide  but the number of subscribers provided by mci worldcom and its authorized resellers nevertheless represent more than a specified percentage of our total users  mci worldcom will pay us only the greater of a per subscriber rate for each of its subscribers or the subscription fees we receive from all of our other channel partners  which could be substantially less than the minimum revenues we currently expect from mci worldcom 
accordingly  our ability to achieve the minimum revenue levels we expect from our agreement with mci worldcom may depend on our ability to enter into channel agreements with one or more large channel partners that can successfully sell subscriptions to our service so that subscribers provided by mci worldcom and its resellers represent less than the threshold percentage of our total users 
in addition  if our deployment schedule is delayed or if we fail to meet deployment schedule deadlines or fail to comply with quality of service standards relating to data transmission performance  network availability  coverage and latency  ease of use and size of modems  all as specified in our agreement  mci worldcom may delay or reduce its minimum payments to us or  in the case of a deployment delay in excess of months  may terminate the contract 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of network operations costs  real estate management costs and depreciation expense on network equipment 
network operations costs include the costs associated with the field managers  engineers and technicians who operate and maintain our high speed network  as well as the costs associated with field offices we maintain  including our network operations centers 
network operations costs also include the telecommunications costs we incur to transmit data between our wired access points and network interface facilities and the internet 
real estate management costs include the costs associated with the maintenance of lease agreements for our poletop radios  wired access points and network interface facilities and the ongoing rental payments for these sites 
real estate management costs also consist of the internal and external labor costs associated with maintaining right of way and other real estate related agreements in the markets where our network is currently deployed 
cost of service revenues was million in compared with million in the decrease in was primarily due to reduced depreciation expense on network equipment resulting from our write down of ricochet network equipment to fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our plans to replace the current ricochet networks with new  higher speed ricochet equipment  we recorded a million charge to write down the carrying value of ricochet network equipment to fair value 
we expect our cost of service revenues to increase significantly and rapidly as the scope of our operations increases through the deployment of our high speed network 
at december   we had future minimum rental commitments under network equipment lease agreements of approximately million per year 
our current lease agreements represent only a small portion of the lease agreements we will require to deploy our network 
we expect rental payments to increase significantly as we enter into additional leases in the first half of and thereafter to support the widespread deployment of our high speed network 
as we commercially launch our high speed service in each market  we will begin depreciating the network equipment and other capitalized costs associated with building our network infrastructure 
our capitalized costs represent costs incurred in designing the network  site acquisition  zoning  construction and installation of equipment 
we will depreciate our capitalized network costs over a useful life of three to five years  depending on the particular asset being depreciated 
we expect our capitalized costs to increase significantly in and as we complete the deployment of our network 
accordingly  we expect that depreciation expense will increase rapidly over the next several years 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of the inventory and manufacturing costs associated with modem and utilinet product sales 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in ricochet cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in ricochet cost of product revenues as a percentage of ricochet product revenues increased to in from in the increase over was primarily due to an increase in product revenues derived from the sale of higher cost ricochet sx modems at lower average selling prices 
we expect ricochet cost of product revenues to increase in as we sell modem inventory directly to mci worldcom or other channel partners for resale to new subscribers to our high speed service 
in subsequent years  we anticipate that our channel partners may begin to purchase modems directly from our licensed third party manufacturers 
utilinet cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in as a result of increased shipments of utilinet products 
utilinet cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased slightly to in from in research and development 
research and development costs include the costs incurred to develop our network technology and subscriber modems  as well as to obtain rights of way and related site agreements in markets where we plan to offer service 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in substantially all of the increase in was due to an increase in costs incurred in to obtain right of way and site agreements in metropolitan areas we currently plan to offer service 
the remainder of the increase was due to costs incurred to deploy a high speed ricochet test network in the first half of at december   we had outstanding commitments of approximately million to third parties performing services associated with acquiring rights of way and related interests in real estate in new markets  the substantial majority of which we expect to spend in we plan to continue to spend a substantial amount on the development of our networking products to reduce the cost of our system components  increase the speed and performance of our services  develop additional applications for our services and to continue to improve and upgrade our network and service to address the emerging demands for mobile data access 
as a result  we expect that research and development costs will continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include our corporate overhead and the costs associated with our efforts to obtain and support our channel partners  promote the ricochet brand and our high speed service  and develop and implement our marketing strategy for our service and modems 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to charges of approximately million in severance to employees terminated in the third and fourth quarters of partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in marketing expenditures related to commercialization of our new high speed network 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs to increase significantly from historical levels as we implement our planned advertising campaign related to the launch of the various phases of our high speed service 
we expect to spend more than million on sales and marketing efforts in and substantially more in we also expect to continue to expand our corporate and administrative infrastructure to support our planned growth 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to a significantly higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in the last two months of as a result of the november sale of our preferred stock for net proceeds of million  and the february sale of common stock  senior notes due and warrants to purchase common stock  we have substantial cash on hand 
we expect to use these cash resources to fund the deployment of our network and to fund operating losses and working capital requirements through the first two phases of our network deployment 
pending these uses  we will invest this cash in high quality  short term  interest bearing securities 
accordingly  we initially expect to generate a substantial amount of interest income  although this interest income will decline rapidly over time as we use this cash 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due to the increase in debt outstanding from vulcan through the first ten months of  as well as the amortization of approximately million in debt issuance costs as a result of the call for redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due as a result of our senior notes and warrants offering in february  we have approximately million in outstanding debt 
the senior notes will require semi annual cash interest payments commencing august  we have deposited approximately million of the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes in a pledge account to secure the first four interest payments on these securities 
we will record a substantial expense  a portion of which will be non cash  for interest on these obligations 
if we incur additional debt in the future to fund our expansion plans  our interest costs will increase 
preferred stock dividends 
in november  we issued  shares of preferred stock to vulcan ventures and mci worldcom for gross proceeds of million 
each share of preferred stock bears a cumulative dividend at the rate of 
per year for the first three years after issuance  which we may pay in cash or in additional shares of preferred stock 
we currently expect to pay dividends on the preferred stock in cash 
because the preferred stock sold to vulcan ventures is immediately convertible into common stock at the holder s option at a conversion price of per share  which was below  the per share closing price of our common stock on the date immediately prior to our execution of the preferred stock purchase agreement  we recorded an additional dividend of million in the fourth quarter of to reflect the beneficial conversion privilege associated with this series of preferred stock 
the preferred stock issued to mci worldcom is also deemed to have been issued with a beneficial conversion privilege 
however  that series of preferred stock does not begin to become convertible into common stock at the holder s option until may as a result  we will amortize that discount  beginning in  over the month period during which this series of preferred stock becomes convertible into common stock at the holder s option 
accordingly  for both series of preferred stock in the aggregate  we will record preferred stock dividends in addition to our cash dividend on the preferred stock as follows million million million million million both series of preferred stock will accrete at approximately million per year in total over the ten year period from the beginning aggregate net book value of million up to its aggregate face value of million 
this accretion will be charged against retained earnings accumulated deficit 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased shipments of ricochet modems 
ricochet product revenues totaled million in compared with million in product revenues in total increased to million in from million in utilinet product revenues decreased to million in from million in due to a decrease in shipments of utilinet products 
we derived a significant portion of utilinet product revenue from southern california edison sce 
product revenues from sce accounted for and of total product revenues in and  respectively 
service revenues increased to million in compared with million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in ricochet subscribers of approximately in ricochet service revenue increased to million in from million in cost of revenues 
cost of service revenues increased to million in from million in this increase reflects an increase in costs incurred to add ricochet infrastructure and increase performance in commercial service areas was partially offset by reductions in inventory costs associated with a decrease in modems rented to customers in cost of service revenues is expected to increase significantly as a result of the continued operation of ricochet networks and planned future deployment of our high speed service 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in ricochet cost of product revenues as a percentage of ricochet product revenues decreased to in from in as a result of an increase in the sale of modems in for which an obsolescence provision was established in utilinet cost of product revenues as a percentage of utilinet product revenues increased to in from in as a result of higher inventory procurement costs 
provision for network replacement 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of million to write down the carrying value of the ricochet network equipment that is currently in operation in three metropolitan areas 
this charge was recorded as a result of our plans to replace this equipment with our high speed network equipment in the near future 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in approximately two thirds of the increase in was due to development of our high speed network technology and subscriber devices 
the increase was also due in part to an increase in costs incurred in to obtain right of way and site agreements in metropolitan areas where we currently plan to offer service 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to charges of approximately million in severance to employees terminated in the third and fourth quarters of partially offsetting this increase was a reduction of million in costs associated with our reduced ricochet sales and marketing efforts in compared with interest income and expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in interest expense in included a one time charge for the interest paid against short term borrowings incurred to participate in the fcc auction in april interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to a slightly higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in as compared with liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the public and private sale of equity and debt securities 
in  we completed a private placement of convertible subordinated notes due with net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we completed a private placement of common stock with vulcan ventures with net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we completed a private placement of redeemable convertible preferred stock with vulcan ventures and mci worldcom with net proceeds of approximately million 
in february  we completed a public offering of common stock with net proceeds of approximately million and a public offering of senior notes due and warrants to purchase common stock with available net proceeds of approximately million  after establishing the required reserve to secure the first four interest payments on the notes 
since inception  we have devoted significant resources to the development  deployment and commercialization of wireless network products and services 
as a result  as of december   we had incurred million of cumulative net losses 
our operations have required substantial capital investments for the purchase of network equipment  modems and computer and office equipment 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
our accounts receivable increased to million as of december  from million at december  due to a higher ricochet subscriber base and an increase in utilinet product shipments in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of inventories decreased to million in from million in due primarily to shipments of current generation ricochet modems 
including network construction in progress  capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect that accounts receivable  inventories and capital expenditures will significantly increase in the future as a result of our ongoing deployment and commercialization of the high speed network 
our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be to fund the deployment of our high speed network  to fund operating losses and to pay interest on our debt securities issued in february  and dividends on our preferred stock 
based on our current projections  we believe that  in addition to the funds on hand at december   we will require additional cash resources of approximately billion to enable us to complete the three phase deployment of our network  as well as for the other purposes described above 
approximately million of these required resources  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses  and after establishing the required interest reserve to secure the first four interest payments on the notes  were funded from the net proceeds of the february common stock  notes and warrants offerings 
accordingly  based on our current projections  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as of december   together with the net proceeds from the common stock  notes and warrants offerings in february  will be sufficient to fund the first two phases of our network deployment 
we will need additional funds to complete the third phase of our network deployment  and the funds we may actually require to complete any phase of the deployment may vary materially from our estimates 
in addition  we could incur unanticipated costs or be required to alter our plans in order to respond to changes in competitive or other market conditions  which could require us to raise additional capital sooner than we expect 
further  although it is not our current intention to do so  we may decide to use a portion of our cash resources to acquire licensed spectrum or to license  acquire or invest in new products  technologies or businesses that we consider complementary to our business 
we cannot assure you that the additional capital we will require to complete the third phase of our network deployment or for these other purposes will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing as necessary  we may need to delay or curtail our expansion plans 
see risk factors we will require significant additional capital in the future to fund our continuing development  deployment and marketing of our high speed network and service and we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current and future operations will require substantial capital investments for the purchase of our network equipment  which consists primarily of network radios  wired access points and network interface facilities 
significant labor costs associated with deploying our network equipment include design of the network  site acquisition  zoning  construction and installation of equipment 
in july  we entered into an agreement with sanmina corporation to manufacture our poletop radios and network radios installed at wired access points 
in october  we entered into agreements with wireless facilities  inc  general dynamics worldwide telecommunications systems and whalen company to provide us with expertise and personnel to assist with the deployment of our network 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately million of network equipment and related labor from these suppliers 
effective january   we changed our capitalization policy for network equipment 
in the construction of the first generation ricochet network  costs incurred for site acquisition and radio frequency engineering were expensed as incurred due to the network s early stage of development 
we believe that our new high speed network currently being deployed is no longer in the early stages of development 
because site acquisition and radio frequency engineering are integral steps in the design and construction of the high speed network  these costs are now being capitalized as part of the total cost of the assets 
we believe the changed policy is preferable 
the effect of the change in accounting principle in was to reduce the net loss available to common stockholders by approximately million or per share in the effect was also to reduce net loss by million  or per share in and to increase net loss by million  or per share in there was no effect as of january  we expect to incur significant expenditures to procure high speed modems in the future 
we have agreed to purchase  modems from our current modem supplier  alps electric usa  inc  in  representing a commitment of approximately million 
we have recently entered into a two year agreement with natsteel electronics  ltd 
for the purchase of additional modems 
we have also recently entered into agreements with sierra wireless and novatel to develop and manufacture custom personal computer card modems 
we have agreed with both sierra wireless and novatel to purchase a minimum of  units in the first year of deliveries from each  representing a total commitment of approximately million 
we anticipate that deliveries from alps will begin during the second quarter of and deliveries from sierra wireless and novatel will begin in early in december  we called our million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due for redemption on january  as of december   million of the notes had been converted into approximately million shares of common stock 
as of the redemption date  all of the note holders had converted their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
as a result of the conversion  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the former convertible note holders 
the preferred stock we issued to mci worldcom and vulcan ventures in november carries a dividend payable annually for three years and no dividend thereafter 
as a result  in december  we paid to the preferred stockholders cash dividends totaling million  representing the pro rata portion of the annual dividend accrued since the date of initial issuance of the shares 
we expect to pay cash dividends of approximately million in both and and million in on our preferred stock 
as a result of our completion of our notes and warrants offering in february  we will have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  which will require semi annual cash interest payments of million  commencing august  we have deposited approximately million of the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes in a pledge account to fund an interest reserve to secure the payment of the first four semi annual cash interest payments on these notes 
in june  metricom investments  inc  our subsidiary  and pepdata  inc  a subsidiary of potomac electric power company  formed metricom dc  llc to own and operate a ricochet network in the washington dc metropolitan area 
metricom investments contributed  and rights to use proprietary technology employed by our ricochet networks in exchange for an interest in metricom dc 
pepdata committed to contributing up to million in exchange for a interest in metricom dc and certain preferential rights to available cash distributions 
as of december   pepdata had contributed approximately million to the joint venture  million of which is reflected as a minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at december  in november  we paid million to pepdata to acquire the minority interest of metricom dc from pepdata 
year compliance 
many installed computer systems and software products were programmed to accept only two digits in the date code field 
as of january   it became necessary for these code fields to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with we have assessed all of our internal computer systems and software products  tested those systems and products and remedied any known problems 
we have upgraded our business and financial systems to a version that our vendors have certified to be year compliant and also communicated with our key suppliers to assess whether or not the products  services  networks and technologies of these suppliers are year compliant 
we have also completed an assessment of whether our networks that depend upon third parties for telecommunications services and power are year compliant 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our year assessment  testing and remediation efforts 
because we have not yet launched our high speed service and because many systems  whether or not they are information technology systems  may contain embedded technology  we cannot assure you that we have identified and remedied all potential year problems that could arise in connection with our high speed service 
we have a contingency plan for handling year problems that were not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence  and we are continuing to assess any exposure areas in order to determine what additional steps are advisable 
we are prepared to use backup systems and have developed other alternative contingency plans for other critical functions where computer systems are essential 
to date  we have not experienced any material year problems 
however  if all of our potential year problems were not properly identified or if adequate assessment and remediation are not timely effected with respect to any year problems  our business could be impaired significantly 
moreover  any year compliance problem facing our customers or third parties who provide our networks with telecommunications services and power could also harm our business 
new accounting standards 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities  and exposure definition 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the pronouncement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
we will adopt sab as required in the first quarter of we have not yet evaluated the effect sab will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates and marketable securities prices  relates primarily to our investment portfolio and redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding at december  our cash equivalents and short term investments subject to interest rate risk are primarily highly liquid corporate debt securities from high credit quality issuers 
we do not have any significant investments in foreign currencies and we do not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the fixed rate  short term nature of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock would not change materially in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the fixed and relatively short term nature of its three year coupon rate
