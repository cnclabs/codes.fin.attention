item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview from our inception in june through december   we devoted our resources primarily to fund research and development  and incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
during this period  we had only limited revenues from grants  and had no revenues from the sale of products or other sources 
we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development and commercialization activities and operations 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for at least the next several years unless such operating losses are offset  if at all  by licensing revenues under strategic alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies which we are currently seeking 
to obtain working capital  we entered into an equity agreement with a private investor in march which allows us to sell to the investor over a two and one half year period  at our sole discretion  but subject to certain restrictions  up to million of our common stock 
at march   we had million remaining on the line of equity 
in january  we sold million of preferred stock to private investors  which had all been converted into  shares of common stock by december  in may we sold million of common stock to private investors 
in november we sold million of common stock to private investors 
in july  we sold  in a secondary public offering   shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had no revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  or research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased by approximately million  or over the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to the costs and expenses associated with the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials as we accelerated our program to commercialize our lead compound  neotrofin tm 
these costs and expenses were due primarily to the increased number and length of our clinical trials and manufacturing and formulation of drug compound  all of which are conducted by outside organizations 
internally  research and development expenses increased in the categories of salaries due to additional personnel and salary increases  research grants  professional fees due to increased patent activity  rent due principally to the re allocation from general and administrative expense as a result of research and development utilizing a higher proportion of our facility and depreciation of property and equipment 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december   over the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for reflect increased expenses related to increases in salaries due principally to added personnel  investor relations  regulatory agency fees and licenses and printing  offset by the re allocation of rent to research and development 
we expect the above mentioned operating expenses to continue to increase in future periods due to expected increases in both research and development  administrative support and sales and marketing activities associated with attempting to bring one or more of our products to market 
in the company entered into a non recurring  non cash settlement of a matter of litigation and recorded a charge to general and administrative expense of  year ended december   compared to year ended december  we had no revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  or research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december   increased by approximately million  or over the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to the costs and expenses associated with the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials as we accelerated our program to commercialize our lead compound  neotrofin tm 
these costs and expenses were primarily in the categories of salaries due to additional personnel  rent  contract manufacturing and formulation of drug compounds  outside preclinical testing and the increased number and length of clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december   over the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for reflect increased expenses related to additional personnel  insurance  professional and consulting fees  commissions  facilities rent and travel 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in future periods due to expected increases in both research and development support and sales and marketing activities associated with attempting to bring one or more of our products to market 
interest income decreased by approximately million  or  in over due to increased use of cash to fund current operations 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we financed our operations primarily through grants  sales of securities  borrowings and deferred payment of salaries and other expenses from related parties 
during september and october  we sold a total of  units of our common stock and attached warrants to the public 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
we realized net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
on march   we executed an agreement with a private investor the equity line agreement which provides for us  at our sole discretion  subject to certain restrictions  to sell put to the investor up to million of our common stock 
the equity line agreement expires in february and  among other things  provides for minimum and maximum puts ranging from  to million  depending on our stock price and trading volume 
puts cannot occur more frequently than every days  and are subject to a discount of from the then current average market price of our common stock  as determined under the equity line agreement 
in addition  we issued to the investor five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
under the equity line agreement  we received proceeds of approximately million from sales of  shares of common stock in and million from sales of  shares of common stock in we received an additional million in january from the sale of  shares of common stock and  as of march   an additional million remains available under the equity line agreement 
we also entered into the following financing transactions from january  through april  on january   we sold to two private investors million of preferred stock  all of which was converted during into  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
the investors also received five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we chose not to exercise an option to acquire an additional million under similar terms 
during the period the preferred stock was outstanding  we paid dividends of approximately  to the investors  on may   we sold to a group of private investors  shares of common stock for approximately million 
the investors also received five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  on july   we completed a secondary public offering and sold  shares of common stock  realizing approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale  on november   we sold to two private investors  one of whom had invested in the january preferred stock transaction   shares of common stock for approximately million  and five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
on march   we issued to the investors an additional  shares of common stock for no further consideration  pursuant to a reset formula contained in the agreement  on february  we sold to two private investors  shares of common stock for million 
the investors also received five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  and on april   we entered into a financing transaction with two private investor groups who have previously invested with us 
the transaction consists of a million in subordinated convertible debentures due april   b redeemable warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock over a two year period the b warrants and c five year warrants to purchase from  shares up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the b warrants can be redeemed in part by us as frequently as several times per week and when called for redemption can be exercised by the investors at of the per share closing market price ie a discount of and are exercisable at the sole option of the investors at the price of per share 
the number of b warrants that are exercisable at each redemption are subject to average daily volume restrictions 
to the extent the b warrants have not been exercised  the investors have committed to two additional tranches of million each of subordinated convertible debentures  subject to certain restrictions  including the following i the investors will limit their investment to of our market capitalization at the time of each additional tranche  not to exceed  ii the shares underlying the april  transaction and the additional tranches must be successfully registered with the sec  and iii we must maintain the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
in the event any of these conditions cannot be met and the additional tranches or other financing alternatives are not available  we may be required to scale back or cancel certain of our clinical development activities 
the debentures are convertible into common stock at per share for the first days after the closing 
thereafter  they are convertible at the lesser of per share or of the market price of the common stock as determined under the agreement 
the two additional tranches of convertible debentures of up to million each  and months after the closing  are at the option of either us or the investor 
if at the option of us  the tranches are under similar terms and conditions as the initial tranche 
if at the option of the investor  the two tranches are at the fixed conversion price of per share 
the amount available under the two additional tranches will be reduced pro rata to the extent that the investors have exercised or we have redeemed the b warrants to purchase common stock 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
the million increase in working capital is attributable primarily to the net proceeds of equity transactions entered into during  aggregating approximately million  less the funding of the million operating loss for the year ended december   offset in part by the million non cash portion of such loss resulting from the settlement of litigation 
through december   we spent principally in approximately million for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of which million was borrowed from a finance company in july pursuant to a million equipment line of credit agreement 
we have pledged substantially all of our tangible assets as collateral for this borrowing 
we have also granted to the finance company a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a share 
in  we intend to spend approximately million for additional equipment  including equipment for our new genomics based subsidiary  as we further expand our research and development laboratories 
we expect to partially finance these capital equipment acquisitions by utilizing our existing equipment line of credit agreement 
effective june we entered into a non cancelable long term operating lease with a major developer 
the initial lease term is seven years with two renewal options for five years each at the then fair market value rate 
minimum rental commitments under this lease for the four and one half year period from january through june are approximately  in and   in   in and  in in addition to rentals  we are obligated under the lease for real property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
we have entered into a series of agreements with a contract research organization to conduct clinical trials in the united states and other countries involving an aggregate of approximately  patients 
the agreements are all cancelable by either party upon thirty days notice and we expect to spend an aggregate of approximately million in and million in for these trials 
through december   we expended approximately million in connection with these clinical trials 
we have also committed to spend approximately  in and  in to a number of universities to conduct general scientific research programs and to provide for fellowship grants 
we have also committed to spend a minimum of million over three years to fund our functional genomics joint venture with the university of california  irvine 
our agreement with the university is cancelable upon thirty days notice by either party 
since our inception  we have been in the development stage and therefore devote substantially all of our efforts to research and development 
we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately million through december   and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
we received approximately million in new funding in early in addition  in april  we received commitments for additional funding of approximately million  contingent on certain terms as defined in the agreement see note 
our future capital requirements and availability of capital will depend upon many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the cost of commercialization activities and other factors which may not be within our control 
assuming that the aforementioned additional funding is available  we believe that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our capital needs for at least months of operations 
we also believe that if these funds are not available  we may be required to scale back or possibly cancel certain clinical trial activities or obtain additional financing elsewhere 
ultimately  we will require substantial additional funds in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
if we are successful in obtaining additional funding  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution to their shares of stock 
without additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development projects  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others which may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize on our own  and which could be on terms unfavorable to us 
year readiness disclosure through march   we have not experienced any problems related to the year issue which have materially impacted our operations or operating results 
accordingly  we believe that our own internal systems are  at the present time  substantially compliant based upon internal systems tests  currently available information and reasonable assurance by our equipment and software vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities and borrowing arrangements 
all investments in marketable securities and borrowing arrangements are entered into for purposes other than trading 
we are not subject to material risks from currency rate fluctuations  nor do we utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of our financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of these investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
our borrowings bear interest at fixed annual rates 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but do not have an impact on earnings or cash flows 
because of the relatively short term nature of our borrowings  fluctuations in fair value are not deemed to be material 
qualitative disclosures our primary exposures relate to interest rate risk on borrowings  our ability to pay or refinance our borrowings at maturity at market rates  interest rate risk on the value of our investment portfolio and rate of return  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future cash requirements 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding borrowings by using fixed rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing borrowings and investment portfolio  we evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
