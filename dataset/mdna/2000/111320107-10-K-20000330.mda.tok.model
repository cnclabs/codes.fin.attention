item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
in this report  all share numbers and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our for stock splits  each in the form of a stock dividend  effective february  and february   respectively 
overview we are the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband digital transmission of voice  video and data to and throughout the home and within the business enterprise 
these integrated circuits permit the cost effective delivery of high speed  high bandwidth networking using existing communications infrastructures that were not originally designed for the transmission of broadband digital content 
using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  we design  develop and supply integrated circuits for a number of the most significant broadband communications markets  including the markets for digital cable set top boxes  cable modems  high speed office networks  home networking  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast  and digital subscriber lines 
from our inception in through  we were primarily engaged in product development and the establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships 
during that period  we generated the majority of our revenue from development work performed for key customers 
we began shipping our products in  and subsequently our revenue has grown predominately through sales of our semiconductor products 
we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers  but expect that development revenue will constitute a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
we also generate a small percentage of our product revenue from sales of software and software support and sales of system level reference designs 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment 
provision is concurrently made for estimated product returns  which historically have been immaterial 
our products typically carry a one year warranty 
we recognize development revenue when earned 
revenue from licensed software is recognized at the time of shipment  provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element of the software offering 
revenue from post contract customer support and any other future deliverables is deferred and earned over the support period or as contract elements are delivered 
the percent of our revenue derived from independent customers located outside of the united states was approximately in  in and in all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  our key customers have placed large orders causing our quarterly revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue in the future 
sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for and in the future 
our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following o our product mix  o the position of our products in their respective life cycles  o competitive pricing strategies  o the mix of product revenue and development revenue  and o manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies 
for example  newly introduced products generally have higher average selling prices and gross margins  both of which typically decline over product life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume pricing agreements 
our gross margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from three to six months or more  with an additional three to six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience a significant delay between increasing expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding revenue  if any 
furthermore  during and thereafter  we intend to continue to increase our investment in research and development  selling  general and administrative functions and inventory as we expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expense research and development selling  general and administrative merger related costs litigation settlement costs income loss from operations interest and other income  net

net income loss years ended december  and effects of pooling of interests transactions 
on may  we completed the acquisitions of maverick networks  epigram  inc and armedia  inc 
on august  we completed the acquisitions of hothaus technologies inc and altocom  inc each of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our historical consolidated financial statements and the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for prior periods have been restated to include the operations of these five companies as if they had combined with our company at the beginning of the first period presented 
included in revenue and net income for were revenue and net losses aggregating million and million  respectively  from maverick  epigram  armedia  hothaus and altocom incurred prior to the respective closings of the transactions 
revenue 
revenue consists of product revenue generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products and  to a lesser extent  from sales of software and software support and development revenue generated under development contracts with our customers 
revenue for was million  an increase of million or as compared with revenue of million in the growth in revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems 
gross profit 
gross profit represents revenue less the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  and costs associated with assembly  test and quality assurance for those products  as well as costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and contracted development work 
gross profit for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of revenue in the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the volume of semiconductor product shipments 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was driven by cost reductions from our suppliers as well as lower than expected rates of price erosion in our major markets 
we expect that gross profit as a percentage of revenue will decline in future periods due to higher anticipated silicon wafer costs and as volume pricing agreements and competitive pricing strategies continue to take effect 
in addition  our gross margin may be affected by the future introduction of certain lower margin products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  and subcontracting costs 
research and development expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the decline in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue reflected a significant increase in revenue during we expect that research and development expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  professional fees  trade show expenses and facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing personnel  senior management and administrative personnel  and increased occupancy  legal and other professional fees  including increased expenses for litigation 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflected a significant increase in revenue during we expect that selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase for the foreseeable future to support the planned continued expansion of our operations and periodic changes in our infrastructure to support increased headcount  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations 
merger related costs 
merger related costs consist primarily of transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other related fees and expenses  and certain restructuring costs related to the disposal of duplicative facilities and assets and the write down of unutilized assets 
merger related costs of approximately million in were incurred in connection with the acquisitions of maverick  epigram  armedia  hothaus  and altocom 
no comparable merger related costs were incurred in the year earlier period 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs consist primarily of settlement fees and associated attorneys fees  expenses and court costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred in deferred compensation 
we recorded approximately million and million of deferred compensation in and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million in and million in represent deferred compensation related to the grant of stock options to certain employees of acquired companies 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
we have presented these amounts as a reduction of shareholders equity and are amortizing these amounts ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options 
we amortized to expense an aggregate of million of deferred compensation in and million in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  less interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net for was million as compared with million in this increase was principally due to increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the consummation of our initial public offering and sale of shares to cisco systems  inc in april  a follow on offering in october  and cash generated by operations 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
our effective tax rate was reduced by tax benefits associated with research and development credits 
our effective tax rate was increased by our inability to recognize the tax benefits of epigram  armedia and hothaus net operating losses incurred during and we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and we provided a valuation allowance of million against a portion of certain acquired net operating losses  due to uncertainty regarding their future realization 
the utilization of such losses is subject to stringent limitations under the internal revenue code 
there is no valuation allowance provided on the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
the primary basis for this conclusion is the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for was million  an increase of million or as compared with revenue of million in this growth in revenue was derived mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of revenue in the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the volume of product shipments 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by volume pricing agreements on products for the high speed networking market 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the decline in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue reflected a significant increase in revenue during selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing personnel  senior management and administrative personnel  and increased occupancy  legal and other professional fees  including increased expenses for litigation 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflected a significant increase in revenue during deferred compensation 
we recorded approximately million and million of deferred compensation in and  respectively 
of the amount  approximately million represents deferred compensation related to the grant of stock options to certain employees of acquired companies 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
we have presented these amounts as a reduction of shareholders equity and are amortizing these amounts ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options 
we amortized to expense an aggregate of million of deferred compensation in and  in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  less interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net for was million compared to  in this increase was principally due to increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the consummation of our initial public offering and sale of shares to cisco systems  inc in april  and a follow on offering in october provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate benefit was in and in the federal statutory tax rates were in and in our effective tax rate was increased in  and our benefit was reduced in  by our inability to recognize the tax benefit of epigram  armedia and hothaus net operating losses incurred during both periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and million in long term investments 
operating activities provided cash of million in this was primarily the result of net income  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization  growth in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory  deferred tax assets and prepaids and other assets 
operating activities used cash of million in and million in cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable  inventory  deferred tax assets and prepaids and other assets  partially offset by net income  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization and growth in accounts payable 
cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to a net loss  growth in accounts receivable  inventory  and a decrease in income taxes payable  which more than offset growth in accounts payable and the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization 
investing activities used cash in the amount of million in for the net purchase of held to maturity investments and million for the purchase of capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
investing activities used cash of million in for the net purchase of held to maturity investments and the purchase of capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of capital equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of million in tax benefits related to stock option exercises and million in net proceeds from issuances of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily the result of million in aggregate net proceeds from our initial public offering and sale of class a common stock to cisco systems in april  million in net proceeds from our follow on offering in october  million in tax benefits related to stock option exercises and million in net proceeds from other issuances of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock and the establishment of a revolving credit facility and term loan 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our shareholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we had commitments totaling approximately million as of december  primarily for the purchase of engineering design tools  computer hardware and information systems infrastructure 
during we spent million on capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
we expect that we will spend more than this amount during to purchase additional engineering design tools  computer hardware  test equipment  information systems and leasehold improvements  as our operations continue to expand and as we integrate and upgrade the capital equipment and facilities of acquired companies 
we may finance these purchases from our cash and cash equivalents and investments on hand  cash generated from our operations  borrowings  equity offerings  or a combination thereof 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including o the market acceptance of our products  o the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  o volume price discounts  o our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  o the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  o capital improvements to new and existing facilities  o technological advances  o our competitors response to our products  and o our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
year compliance many existing computer systems  software applications and embedded computer chips  software and firmware in control devices use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these systems  applications and control devices need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
in addition  they may not correctly process leap year dates or may fail to recognize february  as a leap year date as a result of an exception to the calculation of leap years that will occur in the year and otherwise occurs only once every years 
as a result  these systems and applications had to be upgraded to comply with the year requirements or risk system failure  miscalculations or other disruptions to normal business activities 
to date we have not experienced any year problems in our computer systems or operations 
however  we cannot yet assess the extent of the year impact and cannot be sure that we will not experience unanticipated residual consequences from latent year problems 
we have assessed the impact that the year problem may have on our operations and have identified the following four key areas of our business that may be affected products 
we have evaluated each of our current products and believe that they do not contain date sensitive functionality 
however  we cannot determine whether any of our customers products into which our products are incorporated contain latent year problems because we have little or no control over the design  production and testing of our customers products 
internal infrastructure 
we have completed a full review of the systems  transaction processing computer applications and devices used by us to operate and monitor all major aspects of our business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll  security systems  customer services  infrastructure  materials requirement planning  master production scheduling  networks and telecommunications systems and other systems with embedded computer chips  and believe that our internal infrastructure is year compliant 
however  we may experience latent year problems as a result of the interaction between our own systems and products and the systems and products of third parties 
third party suppliers 
we rely  directly and indirectly  on external systems utilized by our third party suppliers for the management and control of fabrication and the assembly and testing of substantially all of our products 
we have completed surveys and on site visits of the two independent foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  that fabricate substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
in addition  we have completed surveys and on site visits of the three subcontractors  asat ltd  st assembly test services and amkor technology  that assemble and test substantially all of our current products 
these key suppliers have responded to us that their systems are year compliant 
however  any failure of these or other third parties to resolve any residual year problems in a timely manner could materially disrupt our business 
any such disruption could negatively impact our sales  harm our relationships with our customers  and materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely on the external systems of other third parties such as creditors  financial institutions  governmental entities and other suppliers  both domestic and international  to provide us with services and accurate data 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if any of these third parties experience disruptions in their operations or if an economic crisis or general widespread problems result from systems that are not year compliant 
facility and laboratory related systems 
we have reviewed systems such as heating  sprinklers  elevators  test equipment and security at our facilities and labs and believe that these systems are year compliant 
however  these systems may also be affected by latent year problems 
to date  we have incurred approximately  in expenditures in connection with identifying and addressing specific year compliance issues  excluding the cost of routine upgrades to systems  software applications and control devices 
we could incur additional costs in addressing any residual year issues  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
we have developed contingency plans to address those year issues that may pose a significant risk to our on going operations 
these plans include buffer inventories for certain products  implementation of manual procedures to compensate for system deficiencies  and contract is resources to immediately address issues should they arise 
however  any contingency plans we implement may not succeed or may not be adequate to meet our needs without materially impacting our operations 
in addition  the delays and inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in an alternative manner could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
more specifically  if we or our third party suppliers were to lose the ability to manufacture  assemble  test and ship product as a result of year related issues  we would be exposed to missing customer shipments and potentially losing revenues and profits 
acquisitions on february and march  we completed the acquisitions of digital furnace corporation  bluesteel networks  inc and stellar semiconductor  inc these merger transactions will be accounted for as poolings of interests  and we will take a charge for merger related expenses in the fiscal year ending december  we do not anticipate that the merger related expenses will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements presented in the future will be restated to include the financial position and results of operations of the acquired companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  that could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following o the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  o the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  o the gain or loss of a key customer  o the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  o silicon wafer pricing and the availability of foundry and assembly capacity and raw materials  o our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  o the timing of customer industry qualification and certification of our products and the risks of non qualification or non certification  o the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt broadcom technologies in our target markets  o the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our target markets  o the effects of new and emerging technologies  o intellectual property disputes and customer indemnification claims  o the risks inherent in our acquisitions of technologies and businesses  including the timing and successful completion of technology and product development through volume production  integration issues  costs and unanticipated expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  potential contractual  intellectual property or employment issues  accounting treatment and charges  and the risks that the acquisition cannot be completed successfully or that anticipated benefits are not realized  o the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts  o fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  o the risks of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  o risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations  o problems or delays that we may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design integration  o our ability to retain and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the numbers  with the capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  o changes in our product or customer mix  o the quality of our products and any remediation costs  o the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our control  o the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal quarter  o potential business disruptions  claims  expenses and other difficulties resulting from year problems in computer based systems used by us  our suppliers or our customers  o economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  and o general economic and market conditions 
we intend to continue to increase our operating expenses in and in the future 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of a key customer could seriously harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to general instrument  com  and cisco including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue in the year ended december  sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for and in the future 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following o most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty 
o our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
o many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decision to purchase our products 
o our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products 
o some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
o our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
in addition  in order to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face intense competition in the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase in the future as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits in the markets for digital cable set top boxes  cable modems  high speed office networks  home networking  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital satellite  and digital subscriber lines 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors and suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies in the future that more effectively address the transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at lower costs than our technologies 
increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition strategy may require us to make significant capital infusions  be dilutive to our existing shareholders  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that would allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
since january we have acquired maverick networks  epigram  inc  armedia  inc  hothaus technologies inc  altocom  inc  digital furnace corporation  bluesteel networks  inc 
and stellar semiconductor  inc we plan to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in and in the future 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired company 
we may also encounter delays in the timing and successful completion of the acquired company s technology and product development through volume production  costs and unanticipated expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
in addition  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time write offs  increased debt or contingent liabilities  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges or the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may seek to account for acquisitions under the pooling of interests accounting method  but that method may not be available 
any of these events could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition  as in the case of our recent acquisitions  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
thus  for example  as a consequence of the pooling of interest rules  the securities issued in each of the eight acquisitions described above were class b common stock  which has voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions 
in the future  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms 
moreover  due to our limited acquisition experience  it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  products  technologies or personnel  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets in order to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands 
substantially all of our product revenue in recent fiscal quarters has been derived from sales of products for the high speed office network  digital cable set top box and cable modem markets 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
in addition  these markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these markets or other broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
the broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the timeframes that we anticipate 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets  our products could become obsolete and we could lose market share 
products for broadband communications applications generally are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies  such as base t for high speed networking  that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
our inability to anticipate the evolving standards in the semiconductor industry and  in particular the broadband communications markets  or to develop and introduce new products successfully into these markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new silicon solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our quarterly results in the past have been  and are expected in the future to continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to o accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  o accurately define new products  o timely complete and introduce new product designs  o timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and our customers products into which our products will be incorporated  o obtain sufficient foundry capacity  o achieve high manufacturing yields  and o gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our new products generally are incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we have often incurred significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
the value of our products largely depends on the commercial success of our customers products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins 
in addition  the equipment that incorporates our products may never become commercially successful 
we depend on two independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to obtain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
two outside foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  in taiwan and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  or chartered  in singapore  currently manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
in september tsmc s principal facility was affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  tsmc suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired tsmc s wafer deliveries and  together with strong demand  could result in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including o a lack of ensured wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  o limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and o the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to certain of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with either tsmc or chartered 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has recently been reduced due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders  and tsmc and chartered can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with tsmc or chartered  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
such a reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we primarily use two independent foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at any given time and some of our products may be designed to be manufactured at only one 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
any of these delays would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if either tsmc or chartered experiences financial difficulties  if either foundry suffers any damage to its facilities or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries would need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
if we choose to use a new foundry or process  it would typically take us several months to qualify the new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries would be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields 
furthermore  our foundries may not be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
maverick and broadcom homenetworking  inc  formerly known as epigram  inc  have established relationships with foundries other than tsmc and chartered  and we are using these other foundries to produce the initial products of maverick and broadcom homenetworking 
we may utilize such foundries for other products in the future 
in using these new foundries  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to tsmc and chartered 
we may be unable to retain key technical and senior management personnel and attract additional key employees  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  in particular  our co founder  president and chief executive officer  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  and our co founder  vice president of research development and chief technical officer  dr 
henry samueli 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives or any other key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of dr 
nicholas or dr 
samueli  or certain other key employees  would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly digital circuit designers  mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to manage our significant recent and anticipated future growth could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
during the past year  we have continued to significantly increase the scope of our operations and expand our workforce  growing from employees in december to  employees as of march   including contract and temporary employees and employees who joined us as the result of acquisitions 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth of operations is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the ongoing improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems 
we also will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
in the future  we may need to expand our facilities or relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support our growth 
these relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage expanding operations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of any of the three third party subcontractors that assemble and test substantially all of our current products could disrupt our shipments  harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
three third party subcontractors  asat ltd 
in hong kong  st assembly test services  stats  in singapore  and amkor technology in the philippines and taiwan  assemble and test almost all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance and control 
this lack of control has in the past  and could in the future  result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
we do not have long term agreements with asat  stats or amkor 
we typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if either asat  stats or amkor experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  if any subcontractor suffers any damage to its facilities or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
in using these new subcontractors  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraph with respect to asat  stats and amkor 
as our international business expands  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside of the united states 
in addition  approximately of our revenue in each of the years ended december  and was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in we established an international distribution center in singapore and a design center in the netherlands 
as a result of our acquisition of hothaus in august  we now undertake software design  development and marketing activities in canada 
furthermore  as a result of our acquisition of armedia in may  we also undertake design and development activities in india 
in the future  we intend to continue to expand these international business activities and also to open other design and operational centers abroad 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including o political  social and economic instability  o trade restrictions  o the imposition of governmental controls  o exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  o burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  o import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o foreign technical standards  o changes in tariffs  o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
various export licensing requirements  the seasonality of international sales or an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to modify our current business practices significantly 
various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have applied for and received several export licenses under these regulations  but we cannot assure you that we will obtain any licenses for which we have currently applied or any licenses that we may apply for in the future 
if we do not receive the required licenses  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain customers located outside the united states 
moreover  the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
any one or more of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or require us to modify our current business practices significantly 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain of our customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied on our strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and modify the manufacturing processes for our products 
we continually evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce our costs  and we have begun shifting certain products from 
micron to 
micron  
micron and smaller geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that certain of our competitors or other parties may obtain  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we currently hold issued united states patents and have filed over united states patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  then our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
moreover  because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our technology and patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on the adopted standards 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations under those agreements  including product supply obligations  and do not correct this failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
in the future  we may have to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation may be very expensive  divert management s attention and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties and seriously harm our operating results 
companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
in march intel corporation and its subsidiary level one communications  inc filed a lawsuit against us alleging misappropriation of trade secrets  unfair competition and tortious interference with existing contractual relations in connection with our recent hiring of three former intel employees 
in we settled litigation with stanford telecommunications  inc that related to the alleged infringement of one of stanford s patents by several of our cable modem products 
in we prevailed in litigation with sarnoff corporation and nxtwave communications  inc  formerly sarnoff digital communications  inc  which alleged that we misappropriated and misused certain of their trade secrets in connection with our hiring of five former sarnoff employees 
our subsidiary  altocom  is the defendant in patent litigation brought by motorola  inc relating to software modem technology 
although we are defending the pending litigation vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one of our patents 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue an injunction against us that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology 
we may also have to indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory which could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  our customer will often test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customer may need three to six months or longer to test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and our investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenues for these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenues from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that such customer will ultimately market and sell their equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenues for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions  and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  any significant cancellations or deferrals could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
any significant cancellations or deferrals could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
these charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
in order to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  we cannot assure you that our new products will not contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
our operating results may vary significantly due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid technological change 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant economic downturns  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity 
this industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
accordingly  our quarterly results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry 
our california facilities and the facilities of one of the two independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  tsmc  one of the two outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices  is located in taiwan  a country that is also subject to earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in taiwan could materially disrupt tsmc s production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
as a result  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of our products 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
certain of our directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of march  our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
in particular  as of march  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii and dr 
henry samueli  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of a majority of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of any significant corporate transaction  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these insiders currently also control the management of our business 
because of their significant stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these shareholders 
these transactions include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our class a common stock that could give our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for their shares than the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since our initial public offering in april  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  o general conditions in the semiconductor industry and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets  o changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  o changes in investor perceptions  or o changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related and other high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our products and internal information systems and the products and systems of our customers and the third party suppliers who fabricate  test and assemble our products may be negatively impacted by year compliance problems 
many existing computer systems  software applications and embedded computer chips  software and firmware in control devices use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these systems  applications and control devices need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
in addition  they may not correctly process leap year dates or may fail to recognize february  as a leap year date as a result of an exception to the calculation of leap years that will occur in the year and otherwise occurs only once every years 
as a result  these systems and applications had to be upgraded to comply with the year requirements or risk system failure  miscalculations or other disruptions to normal business activities 
we have evaluated our year readiness  both in terms of the compliance of our products and the compliance of our information systems and applications which monitor all aspects of our business  including financial systems  customer services  marketing information  infrastructure and telecommunications equipment 
we believe that our products and internal information systems are year compliant 
to date we have not experienced any year problems in our computer systems or operations 
however  we cannot yet assess the extent of the year impact and cannot be sure that we will not experience unanticipated residual consequences of the change in centuries due to the interaction between our own systems and products and the systems and products of third parties 
we believe our greatest exposure to residual year risks relates to the readiness of the third party suppliers who fabricate  assemble and test our products and of our customers  who incorporate our products into their own products 
any failure of these third parties to resolve any residual year problems in a timely manner could materially disrupt our business and affect the marketability of our products 
any such disruption could negatively impact our sales  harm our relationships with our customers  and materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely on the external systems of other third parties such as creditors  financial organizations  governmental entities and other suppliers  both domestic and international  to provide us with services and accurate data 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if any of these third parties experience disruptions in their operations or if an economic crisis or general widespread problems result from systems that are not year compliant 
our contingency plans to address these issues may not be adequate to meet our needs without disrupting our business or without causing delays and inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in an alternative manner 
if we fail to adequately address any year problems that do emerge  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including o the market acceptance of our products  o the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  o volume price discounts  o our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  o the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  o capital improvements to new and existing facilities  o technological advances  o our competitors response to our products  and o our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and will in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our publicly held class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the existence of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock may prevent parties from acquiring us 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock 
finally  these factors may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock
