item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  on march   the company completed the recapitalization transactions which  among other things  substantially recapitalized the company and modified its investment policy 
effective june   the company which was organized under california law changed its domicile to maryland by merging with a newly formed subsidiary organized under maryland law  and issued new shares of the subsidiary to the company s shareholders in exchange for their shares in the company 
concurrently  the company consummated a one for six reverse stock split 
immediately prior to the consummation of the recapitalization transactions  the company s assets primarily consisted of approximately million in short term  liquid real estate investments  cash and cash equivalents 
on december   the company sold million of preferred shares and warrants to purchase class a shares to a group of investors affiliated with lazard freres 
concurrent with the sale of the preferred shares and warrants  the company purchased million in real estate loans and participation interests from a group of investors also affiliated with lazard freres 
these transactions are referred to collectively as the lazard transaction 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  on november   the company s shareholders approved a series of transactions including i the acquisition of trinet  ii the acquisition of the company s external advisor  and iii the reorganization of the company from a trust to a corporation and the exchange of the class a and class b shares for common stock 
pursuant to the trinet acquisition  trinet merged with and into a subsidiary of the company  with trinet surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in the acquisition  each share of common stock of trinet was converted into shares of common stock 
each share of trinet series a  series b and series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock was converted into a share of series b  series c or series d respectively cumulative redeemable preferred stock of the company 
the company s preferred stock issued to the former trinet preferred stockholders has substantially the same terms as the trinet preferred stock  except that the new series b  c  and d preferred stock have additional voting rights not associated with the trinet preferred stock 
the company s series a preferred stock remained outstanding with the same rights and preferences as existed prior to the trinet acquisition 
as a consequence of the acquisition of its external advisor  the company is now self advised and will no longer pay external advisory fees 
the transactions described above and other related transactions have materially impacted the historical operations of the company and will continue to impact the company s future operations 
accordingly  the reported historical financial information for periods prior to these transactions is not believed to be fully indicative of the company s future operating results or financial condition 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during fiscal year  total revenue increased by approximately million over total revenue for fiscal year this increase is a result of the interest generated by the loans and other investments contributed in the recapitalization transactions  as well as approximately million of other loan investments newly originated or acquired by the company during  an additional million funded under existing loan commitments  and approximately million in operating lease income generated from net lease assets acquired in the trinet acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by principal repayments of approximately million made to the company during fiscal year included in other income for fiscal year is a fee associated with the repayment of a construction loan of approximately million  yield maintenance payments of approximately million resulting from the repayment of three loans  and approximately million in additional revenue from certain cash flow participation features on five of the company s loan investments 
the company s total costs and expenses during fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal these increases were generally the result of the increased scope of the company s operations as a result of the recapitalization transactions  costs associated with additional lending operations  the trinet acquisition and the acquisition of the company s external advisor 
the company s interest expense increased by million as a result of higher interest rates and higher average borrowings by the company on its credit facilities and other term loans  the proceeds of which were used to fund additional loan origination and acquisition activities 
further  interest expense includes interest incurred by the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
property operating costs represent unreimbursed property operating expenses incurred by the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
all costs of this kind were borne directly by the tenant on the company s pre existing credit tenant leasing portfolio 
depreciation and amortization increased as a result of a full year s depreciation on the company s pre existing credit tenant leasing portfolio  which it acquired in the recapitalization transactions  as well as depreciation on the leasing subsidiary s net leased assets subsequent to its acquisition 
general and administrative costs increased by approximately million as a result of additional costs incurred subsequent to the acquisition of the company s external advisor  as well as additional administrative expenses associated with the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
base advisory fees increased by approximately million as a result of fees being incurred from june  through year end in the prior year and through november  in fiscal further  as a result of the company s expanded operations  incentive fees paid under the prior advisory contract increased from million in to million in subsequent to the acquisition of the company s external advisor  the company is now internally managed and no further advisory fees will be incurred 
the company s charge for provision for possible credit losses increased by approximately million as a result of expanded lending operations as well as additional seasoning of the company s existing lending portfolio 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has not realized any actual losses on any of its loan investments to date 
stock compensation expense declined by approximately million as a result of the non recurring charge relating to the original grant of stock options to the company s external advisor in fiscal concurrently with the consummation of the recapitalization transactions 
finally  as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in fiscal costs and expenses is a non recurring charge of approximately million relating to the acquisition of the company s external advisor 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during fiscal year  total revenue increased by approximately million over total revenue for fiscal year this increase is a result of the interest generated by the loans and other investments contributed in the recapitalization transactions  as well as approximately billion of other loan investments newly originated or acquired by the company during  and an additional million funded under existing loan commitments 
the increase was partially offset by principal repayments of approximately million made to the company during fiscal year included in other income for fiscal year are fees associated with the repayment of two first mortgage loans aggregating approximately million  a gain of approximately million resulting from the repayment of a million loan participation which had been acquired at a discount  and approximately million in additional revenue from certain cash flow participation features on two of the company s loan investments 
in  a gain of approximately million was recognized in other income on the early repayment of a loan acquired at a discount 
the increase in the company s total costs and expenses during fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increased interest expense on the company s borrowings used to fund its asset growth as well as the expense associated with the issuance to the advisor of options to acquire approximately million of the company s class a shares see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
additionally  general and administrative costs associated with the implementation of the company s business plan and advisory fee expenses increased the company s total costs and expenses during fiscal the company believes that because of the significant expansion of the scope of its operations following the recapitalization transactions which occurred on march   prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the company s future operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital to fund its investment origination and acquisition activities and operating expenses 
the company s capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under lines of credit  additional term borrowings  long term financing secured by the company s assets  unsecured financing and the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
as a result of the recapitalization transactions  the lazard transaction  the trinet acquisition  the acquisition of the company s external advisor  and other transactions completed by the company  the company has significant access to capital resources to fund its existing business plan  which includes the expansion of its real estate lending and credit tenant leasing businesses 
further  the company may acquire other businesses or assets using its capital stock  cash or a combination thereof 
the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code restrict the company s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish capital committed to its operations 
however  the company believes that its significant capital resources and access to financing will provide it with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and leasing transactions 
the company s ability to meet its long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to the renewal of its credit lines and or obtaining other sources of financing  including issuing additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision by the company s lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company will depend upon a number of factors  such as compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
based on its monthly interest and other expenses  monthly cash receipts  existing investment commitments and funding plans  the company believes that its existing sources of funds will be adequate to purposes of meeting its short and long term liquidity needs 
material increases in monthly interest expense or material decreases in monthly cash receipts would negatively impact the company s liquidity 
on the other hand  material decreases in monthly interest expense would positively affect the company s liquidity 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had existing fixed rate borrowings of approximately million secured by real estate under operating leases which mature in  an aggregate of approximately million in libor based  variable rate loans secured by various senior and subordinate mortgage investments which mature in fiscal  fixed rate corporate debt obligations aggregating approximately million which mature between and  and other variable and fixed rate secured debt obligations aggregating approximately million which mature at various dates through in addition  the company has entered into libor based secured revolving credit facilities of and million which expire in fiscal and respectively 
subsequent to december   the company extended the maturity of its million facility to 
as of december   the company had drawn approximately million and million under these facilities 
availability under these facilities is based on collateral provided under a borrowing base calculation 
in addition  the leasing subsidiary has an agreement with a group of banks led by bank of america  na which provides it with a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
this facility matures on may  and has a one year extension period at the company s option 
interest incurred on the facility is libor based with a margin dependent on the company s credit ratings 
facility fees under the credit facility are also tied to its credit ratings 
all of the available commitment under the facility may be borrowed for general corporate and working capital needs of the leasing subsidiary  as well as for investments 
under the terms of this facility  the leasing subsidiary is generally permitted to make cash distributions to the company in an amount equal to of cash flow from operations in any rolling four quarter period 
the facility requires interest only payments until maturity  at which time outstanding borrowings are due and payable 
as of december   the company had million drawn and million available under this facility 
the company has entered into libor interest rate caps struck at  and in notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively  which expire in march  january and june  respectively 
at december   the fair value appreciation of the company s interest rate caps was million 
the company has originated or acquired certain assets using proceeds from libor based borrowings 
in connection with such borrowings  the company entered into approximately million of interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on such obligations 
in addition  in connection with the trinet acquisition  the company acquired an interest rate swap which  together with certain existing interest rate cap agreements  effectively fix the interest rate on million of the leasing subsidiary s libor based borrowings at plus the applicable margin through december  management expects that it will have aggregate libor based borrowings at the leasing subsidiary in excess of the notional amount for the duration of the swap 
the actual borrowing cost to the company with respect to indebtedness covered by the swap will depend upon the applicable margin over libor for such indebtedness  which will be determined by the terms of the relevant debt instruments 
at december   the fair value appreciation of the company s interest rate swaps was million 
the company is currently pursuing or has consummated certain anticipated long term fixed rate borrowings and had entered into certain derivative instruments based on us treasury securities to hedge the potential effects of interest rate movements on these transactions 
under these agreements  the company would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments will be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
during the year ended december   the company settled an aggregate notional amount of approximately million that was outstanding under such agreements  resulting in a receipt of approximately million to be amortized over the term of the anticipated borrowing 
during the year ended december   the company refinanced its million term loan maturing march  with a million term loan maturing march  the new term loan bears interest at per annum  payable monthly  and amortizes over an approximately year schedule 
the new term loan represented one of the forecasted transactions for which the company had previously entered into us treasury based hedging transactions 
the net million cost of the settlement of such hedges has been deferred and will be amortized as an increase to the effective financing costs of the new term loan over its year term 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that the remaining forecasted transactions will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company will cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
no such gains or losses have been recognized by the company 
stock repurchase program the board of directors approved  and the company has implemented  a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under its credit facilities if the company determines that it is advantageous to do so 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million shares  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
year the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company intends such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities reform act of  and is including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the company are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  the company s actual costs progress and expenses with respect to its plan to address year issues could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
factors which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results and progress include  but are not limited to  changes in the expense of or delays  in the identification and upgrade or replacement by the company of computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  and the year compliance of vendors including vendors of the company s computer information systems or third party service providers including the company s primary bank and payroll processor 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems could results in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the term year compliant is used in this discussion to mean that the system or device in question will perform its essential functions in the year without significant operational problems 
parent the company implemented a plan in to assess  test and correct  to the extent necessary  potential year issues 
additionally  the company assessed the potential impacts from outside parties and developed contingency plans for business interruptions after the date rollover 
the costs involved in performing this internally managed plan were not significant to the company s financial position or results of operations in and since january   the company has not experienced any material adverse impacts due to the year issue 
while the primary risk to the company with respect to the year issue continues to be the inability of external parties to provide services in a timely and accurate manner  to date  the company is not aware of any such disruption 
as a result  the company does not expect any remaining year risk to have a material adverse impact to the company 
leasing subsidiary the leasing subsidiary recognized that the year may result in risk and implemented a plan in to prepare for potential year issues 
the leasing subsidiary s efforts to address potential year issues were focused in the following four areas i reviewing and taking any necessary steps to correct the leasing subsidiary s computer information systems ie  software applications and hardware platforms  ii evaluating and making any necessary modifications to other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology at its properties  such as security  heating  ventilation  and air conditioning  elevator  fire and safety systems  iii communicating with certain significant third party service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect the leasing subsidiary  and iv developing contingency plans for business interruptions after the date rollover 
the leasing subsidiary s year compliance program is substantially complete 
the cost involved in performing this internally managed plan were not significant to the leasing subsidiary s financial position or results of operations 
the leasing subsidiary expects that a substantial portion of these costs will be passed back to tenants through recoveries of operating expense and that the remaining costs of addressing the year issues will be funded through operating cash flows 
since the date rollover on january   the leasing subsidiary has not experienced any material adverse impact due to the year issue 
while the primary risk to the leasing subsidiary  with respect to the year issue  is the ability of certain third party service providers to continue to provide services in a timely and accurate manner  to date  the leasing subsidiary is not aware of any such disruption 
while the leasing subsidiary s efforts to address its year issues may involve additional costs  the leasing subsidiary believes  based on available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  sfas no 
requires disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information regarding the different types of business activities in which an enterprise engages and the different economic environments in which it operates 
the company adopted the requirements of this pronouncement in its financial statements beginning with its reporting for fiscal as of december   the company is currently segmented between its lending and credit tenant lease businesses 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

on june  the fasb voted to defer the effectiveness of sfas for one year 
sfas is now effective for fiscal years beginning after june   but earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter subsequent to june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as i a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  ii a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or iii in certain circumstances a hedge of a foreign currency exposure 
the company currently plans to adopt this pronouncement as required effective january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material financial impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing its business plan  the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with its election to qualify as a reit  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that floating rate assets be primarily financed by floating rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
the company s operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on its assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on the company s interest bearing assets  which the company may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on its borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of the company s interest bearing assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of the company s interest earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to the company 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include i variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and ii discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while the company generally seeks to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  the company could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company has not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to the company which adversely affect its liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs match funding based hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps  futures and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce the company s exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk of its borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between the company and a third party the counterparty 
when the company purchases a cap or floor contract  the company makes an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company in the future should the reference rate typically one or three month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  the company will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  the company will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
the cost of the up front payment is amortized over the term of the contract 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  the company s swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of floating rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from the company 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of that of the specified instrument eg  eg treasury securities upon settlement 
the company generally uses such instruments to hedge forecasted fixed rate borrowings 
under these agreements  the company will generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments will be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company will cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
no such gains or losses have been recognized by the company 
while a reit may freely utilize the types of derivative instruments discussed above to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  prepayment or interest rate exposure on the company s loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  the company may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
the company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  the company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that the company will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract it enters into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases as of december   less related interest expense and property operating costs  for the year ended december   on a pro forma basis for the trinet acquisition 
net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of off balance sheet instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with the company s assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and property type 
most of the company s loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties and contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
