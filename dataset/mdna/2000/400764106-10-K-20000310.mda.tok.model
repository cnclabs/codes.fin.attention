the company s provision for loan losses during the twelve months ended december  was  compared with  during the twelve months ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in the provision was due in part to the strong asset quality of the loan portfolio and the transfer of the allowance for loan losses of  acquired from first american 
strong asset quality is reflected as net charge offs remain at low levels totaling  or of average loans in compared with  or of average loans in the company s provision for loan losses increased from  in to  in as a result of loan growth 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important source of revenue for financial institutions 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts and other banking service related fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  from million in and up from million in the year ended december  included a gain on sale of assets of  and the year ended december  included a gain on sale of loans of  which occurred when the company sold million in loans that were originally purchased at a discount in from the rtc

additionally  the company s increased emphasis on fee based services resulted in greater income from check cashing  atm fees  appraisal fees and wire transfer fees 
noninterest expense for the years ended december   and  noninterest expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in was primarily the result of additional operating expenses incurred at the new pittsburg  texas location which opened in may and in connection with the addition of the sulphur springs and commerce locations acquired from first american in september these new locations as well as customer growth in various other markets contributed to the increase in employee compensation and benefits as the company s number of full time equivalent employees grew from at december  to at december  in addition  bank premises and fixed asset expense increased from million to million  an increase of  or 
legal and professional fees increased  or due to independent loan review expenses and bankruptcy and litigation proceedings

the effective tax rates in  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes for financial purposes in the consolidated statements of earnings differ from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of to earnings before income taxes 
the difference in the statutory rate is primarily due to the tax benefits on the leveraged lease transactions and non taxable income 
additionally  the state of texas imposes a texas franchise tax 
taxable income for the income tax component of the texas franchise tax is the federal pre tax income  plus certain officers salaries  less interest income from federal securities 
total franchise tax expense was  in   in and  in such expense was included as a part of other noninterest expense 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

  farmland   non residential and non farmland   multi family residential consumer   total loans   the primary lending focus of the company is on loans to small and medium sized businesses and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company s commercial lending products include business loans  commercial real estate loans  equipment loans  working capital loans  term loans  revolving lines of credit and letters of credit 
most commercial loans are collateralized and on payment programs 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
in almost all cases  the company requires personal guarantees on commercial loans to help assure repayment 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  typically have fixed interest rates and amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to three years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a limited extent  nonresidential properties 
construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate 
the company conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the company s construction lending activities 
in keeping with the community oriented nature of its customer base  the company provides construction and permanent financing for churches located within its market area 
the company rarely makes loans at its legal lending limit 
lending officers are assigned various levels of loan approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
loans above  are evaluated and acted upon by the executive committee  which meets weekly and are reported to the board of directors 
the company s strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow conservative loan policies and underwriting practices which include i granting loans on a sound and collectible basis  ii investing funds properly for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  iii serving the legitimate needs of the community and the company s general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  iv ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan  v developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each category  and vi ensuring that each loan is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
the company s loan review and compliance personnel interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  the company has placed increased emphasis on the early identification of problem loans to aggressively seek resolution of the situations and thereby keep loan losses at a minimum 
management believes that this strict adherence to conservative loan policy guidelines has contributed to the company s below average level of loan losses compared to its industry peer group over the past few years 
the company s loans collateralized by one to four family residential real estate generally are originated in amounts of no more than of the lower of cost or appraised value 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
of the mortgages originated  the company generally retains mortgage loans with short terms or variable rates and sells longer term fixed rate loans that do not meet the company s credit underwriting standards 
prior to the acquisition of first american  the company sold such loans to texas independent bank mortgage company  however  since the first american acquisition  the company sells these loans in the secondary market through guaranty mortgage company 
as of december   the company s one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio was million 
of this amount  million is repriceable in one year or less and an additional million is repriceable from one year to five years 
these high percentages in short term real estate loans reflect the company s commitment to reducing interest rate risk 
the company provides a wide variety of consumer loans including motor vehicle  watercraft  education loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
as of december   the company had no indirect consumer loans  indicating a preference to maintain personal banking relationships and strict underwriting standards 
during the last two years  management has placed tighter controls on consumer credit due to record high personal bankruptcy filings nationwide 
this concern also prompted management to sell its credit card portfolio at book value to texas independent bank in march the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial  industrial and real estate construction loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates in each maturity range as of december   are summarized in the following table december  after one one year through after or less five years five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial    real estate construction    total     loans with a predetermined interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
the company s conservative lending approach  as well as a healthy local economy  has resulted in strong asset quality 
nonperforming assets at december   decreased to million compared with million at december  nonperforming assets were million at december  this resulted in ratios of nonperforming assets to total loans plus other real estate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases to accrue interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
loans where the interest payments jeopardize the collection of principal are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual is recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring  however  the company had no restructured loans at either december   december  or december  in addition to an internal loan review  the company retains ibs for an annual external review to evaluate the loan portfolio 
the company maintains current appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at fair value at the time of acquisition  less estimated costs to sell 
the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans other real estate  total nonperforming assets 
     nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas no 
 as amended  a loan is considered impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management has established an allowance for loan losses  which it believes  is adequate for estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security  the evaluation of its loan portfolio through an annual external loan review conducted by ibs and the annual examination of the company s financial statements by its independent auditors 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company follows an internal loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition  the company contracts with ibs to annually perform an external loan review 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans internally classified as substandard or in the more severe categories of doubtful or loss are those loans that at a minimum have clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   a increase 
this increase is due primarily to the classification of approximately million in loans as substandard during the classification was made due to cash flow deficiencies and the acquisition of approximately million of internally classified substandard problem assets from first american 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   a increase 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers the risk classification or delinquency status of loans and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status 
an unallocated allowance is also established based on the company s historical charge off experience 
the company then charges to operations a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology 
management actively monitors the company s asset quality and provides specific loss allowances when necessary 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations

   securities the company uses its securities portfolio to ensure liquidity for cash requirements  to manage interest rate risk  to provide a source of income  to ensure collateral is available for municipal pledging requirements and to manage asset quality 
at december   investment securities totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to the investment of additional funds both internally generated and acquired with the first american acquisition 
during  securities decreased approximately million from million at december   to million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the company s strong loan demand that increased loans by approximately million during at december   investment securities represented of total assets compared to of total assets at december  the yield on the investment portfolio for the year ended december   was compared to a yield of for the year ended december  during  the company invested in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos in its securities portfolio 
a cmo is collateralized directly by mortgages or by mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
these investments were made in order to obtain higher yielding securities with more defined cash flows and shorter average lives

at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized

  total   mortgage backed securities are securities  which have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and are principally issued by federal agencies such as the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest  which are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
all the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were agency issued collateral obligations 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
therefore  the average life  or the average amount of time until the company receives the total amount invested  of the mortgage backed security will be shorter than the contractual maturity 
the company estimates the remaining average life of the fixed rate mortgage backed security portfolio to be less than five years 
mortgage backed securities  which are purchased at a premium  will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities and cmos earn interest at floating rates and reprice within one year  and accordingly are less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december  and million at december  the net change reflects an increase of million or in fixed assets 
the increase is primarily due to the purchase of the land and building in pittsburg  texas for a new full service location which opened in may  the first american acquisition  which included full service bank facilities in sulphur springs and commerce  texas  and the building of an operations center in mount pleasant  texas to handle the additional staff required due to increased volumes and locations 
other assets on july   the company invested million in single insurance premium policies 
such policies insured the lives of certain key senior officers 
as of december  the net surrender values of these policies totaled million 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposit accounts consist of demand  savings  money market and time accounts 
the company relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
the company does not have or accept any brokered deposits 
total deposits at december   increased to million from million at december   an increase of million or 
the increase can be attributed to several factors 
first  the company s certificates of deposits increased from million at december   to million at december   a million or increase for the year 
second  public fund deposits were million at december   an increase of million or from million at december  one contract  lamar county  was added in and no contracts were added in third  the company continues to expand its customer base with its free checking product and its premier money market account 
the number of checking accounts increased to  while the number of premier money market accounts increased to  during the paris and texarkana locations  as well as the new pittsburg  sulphur springs  and commerce locations  increased their deposits by a combined million during the year ended december  management believes these locations will continue to gain market share as the company becomes better known in these communities 
in  deposits rose to million from million in  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in certificates of deposits of million and an increase in public funds of million

fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for two borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  called short term fixed  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from days 
the company does not currently have any borrowings under this program 
as of december   the company does not have any of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
the second borrowing program  the blanket borrowing program  is under a borrowing agreement  which does not require the delivery of specific collateral 
borrowings are limited to a maximum of of the company s one to four family residential mortgage loans 
at december   the company had approximately million borrowed of a potential million available under this program  leaving approximately million in available borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity the company s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management  and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels in interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital based on the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  commitments to originate loans  and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses an interest rate shock simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are utilized when they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not currently enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
however  it is management s intent to achieve a proper balance so that incorrect rate forecasts should not have a significant impact on earnings 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within greater than days days days years years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities         loans         federal funds sold   due from banks total interest earning assets         interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits       borrowed funds    total interest bearing liabilities       period gap         cumulative gap        period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the company s one year cumulative gap position at december   was negative million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
the company maintains a rate committee and the alco that reviews the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly or monthly basis  respectively 
liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consisted mainly of growth in core deposits  supplemented by investment securities and earnings through operating activities 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the tdb 
both the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations

year compliance general 
the year risk involved computer programs and computer software that are not able to perform without interruption into and during the year if computer systems did not correctly recognize the date change from december   to january   computer applications that rely on the date field could fail or create erroneous results 
such erroneous results could affect interest  payments or due dates or caused the temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
if the company  its suppliers and its borrowers  failed to address these issues there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
state of readiness 
the company formally initiated its year project and plan in august to insure that its operational and financial systems would not be adversely affected by year problems 
the company formed a year project team  and the board of directors and management supported all compliance efforts and allocated the necessary resources to ensure completion 
an inventory of all systems and products including both information technology it and non informational technology non it systems that could have been affected by the year date change was developed  verified and categorized as to their importance to the company and an assessment of all mission critical it and mission critical non it systems was completed 
this assessment involved inputting test data which simulated the year date change into such it systems and reviewing the system output for accuracy 
the company s assessment of mission critical non it systems involved reviewing such systems to determine whether they were date dependent 
based on such assessment  the company believed that none of its critical systems were date dependent 
the software for the company s systems is provided through service bureaus and software vendors 
the company contacted all of its third party vendors and software providers and required them to demonstrate and represent that the products provided were year compliant and a program of testing compliance was planned 
the company s item processing software provider  which performs substantially all of the company s data processing functions  stated that its software is year compliant and pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines the company tested scenarios to verify this assertion 
in addition  the fdic reviewed the company s compliance with year issues on several occasions 
risks related to third parties 
the impact of year noncompliance by third parties with which the company transacts business cannot be accurately gauged 
the company identified its largest dollar depositors aggregate deposits over  and loan customers  or more and  based on information available to the company  conducted evaluations to determine which of those customers were likely to be affected by year issues 
in addition  corporate borrowers were contacted and assessed by their respective lending officers and scored on a scale of one  two or three  with three being the least affected by year issues 
a corporate borrower  which received a rating of one or two  was subsequently contacted to assess year readiness efforts 
to the extent a problem was identified with respect to a customer  the company monitored the customer s progress in resolving such problem 
in the event that year noncompliance adversely affected borrowers  the company may be required to charge off the loan to such borrowers 
for a discussion of possible effects of such charge offs  see contingency plans below 
the company is not aware of any material problem by any of its customers that would affect their repayment of any such loans 
with respect to depositors  the company had additional cash on hand to handle any excessive withdrawals 
with respect to its borrowers  the company includes in its loan documents a year disclosure form and an addendum to the loan agreement in which the borrower represents and warrants its year compliance to the company 
transition into the year the company suffered no failures in any system or product upon the date change from december  to january  in addition  management is not aware of any vendor or provider used by the company for data processing or related services which experienced a material failure of its product or service due to a year related problem 
the company is also subject to risks associated with year noncompliance by its customers 
management is not aware of any customer which suffered losses related to a year problem which would adversely affect that customer s financial condition or its ability to repay any outstanding loan it has with the company 
cost of compliance 
the company budgeted  to address year issues 
as of february   the company s expenses did not exceed the amount budgeted 
while the company believes that it will incur no additional material expenses related to the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will not be impacted by a year related problem which occurs after the date hereof or by the failure of a third party to achieve proper year compliance 
ongoing plans 
although many of the critical dates related to potential year related problems have passed  experts predict that year related failures could occur throughout the year  such as on february  and december  accordingly  the company s year project team will continue to monitor the company s it and non it systems and attempt to identify any potential problems during the course of the year 
in addition  the company will continue to monitor the year compliance of the third parties with which the company transacts business 
contingency plans 
the company continues to maintain its contingency plans with respect to year and believes that if its own systems should fail  the company could convert to a manual entry system for a period of up to three months without significant losses 
the company believes that any mission critical system could be recovered and operating within three to five days 
in the event that the federal reserve is unable to handle electronic funds transfers and check clearing  the company does not expect the impact to be material to its financial condition or results of operations as long as the company is able to utilize an alternative funds transfer and clearing source 
as part of its contingency planning  the company reviewed its loan customer base and the potential impact on capital of year noncompliance 
based upon such review and the fact that no material problems occurred at the date rollover  using what it considers to be a reasonable worst case scenario  the company has assumed that certain of its commercial borrowers whose businesses may still be affected by year noncompliance would be unable to repay their loans  resulting in charge offs of loan amounts in excess of collateral values 
if such were the case  the company believes that it is unlikely that its exposure would exceed  management does not believe that this amount is material enough for the company to adjust its current methodology for making provisions to the allowance for loan losses
