item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 
overview we are a leading developer and operator of stand alone laser vision correction centers 
during the second half of we began converting our centers to a value priced model whereby bilateral lasik procedures both eyes would be performed for  we also changed the name of the centers offering the value priced model to lasikplus 
an integral part of this conversion included our retaining ophthalmologists to perform procedures at our centers and less dependence on offering access to other ophthalmologists 
as of mid january two centers had not yet been converted to the lasikplus model 
our laser vision correction centers provide the facilities  equipment and support services for performing vision correction procedures using state of the art laser technologies 
the visx star s laser  which we have in each of our us centers  can be used for correcting nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
substantially all of the revenues from our laser vision correction procedures are derived from our us centers 
we also managed multi specialty laser surgery programs at medical facilities on a contract basis 
our sources of revenue are laser refractive surgery  including fees for procedures performed at our consolidated centers  and other  including management fees for operating laser vision correction centers of investees  contractual fees for managing multi specialty laser surgery programs at hospitals  marketing and education program fees  and miscellaneous sources 
our operating costs and expenses consist of medical professional and license fees  including per procedure fees for the ophthalmologists performing laser vision correction and the license fee of per procedure paid to visx  direct costs of services  including center rent and utilities  equipment lease and maintenance costs  surgical supplies  center staff expense and costs related to other revenue  general and administrative  including marketing and advertising  headquarters staff expense  and other overhead costs  and depreciation and amortization of equipment and intangible assets recorded in the balance sheet 
sources of revenues the table below summarizes our sources of revenue and their annual growth or decline for each of the three years ended december  dollars in thousands laser refractive surgery    growth rate surgery management contracts   growth rate other   growth rate total    laser refractive surgery laser refractive surgery revenue generally includes three components facility fees  royalty fees and medical professional fees 
certain states prohibit us from practicing medicine  employing physicians to practice medicine on our behalf or employing optometrists to render optometry services on our behalf 
revenues and direct costs from centers in these states do not include the medical professionals fee component 
the contribution from laser refractive surgery procedures for each of the three years ended december  is as follows dollars in thousands dollars in thousands revenue    direct costs    contribution    our results of operations in any period are significantly affected by the number of laser vision procedures performed 
the following table illustrates the growth of laser vision correction procedures performed at our consolidated centers 
wholly owned first quarter   second quarter    third quarter    fourth quarter    year    other revenue declined because we intentionally reduced the extent to which we provided management services for multi specialty surgery programs at hospitals due to the difficult business environment 
renewal of our contracts with hospital providers became increasingly difficult due to price pressures and a lengthening sales cycle 
hospital providers and other entities were being driven to reduce costs and scaleback their operations  sometimes including the programs that we managed 
in addition  budget reductions at the facilities reduced the marketing and education programs  key elements to a successful surgery program 
our final surgery management contract was not renewed in the fourth quarter operating costs and expenses compared to the following table shows the dollar amount of increase decrease of operating expenses from to and the percent of revenues for each year dollars in thousands increase of revenue decrease medical professional and license fees  direct costs of services general and administrative expenses  marketing and advertising  depreciation and amortization medical professional and license fees rose due to the increase in procedures 
direct costs of services include payroll  equipment lease and maintenance  facility rent and supply costs associated with providing our services 
these costs are  for the most part  fixed and will decline as a percent of revenues with revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses increased  but declined as a percent of revenues  due to the hiring of additional personnel to strengthen our operations and marketing departments 
in addition  our costs associated with credit card processing  financing programs and incentive programs for high volume physicians were higher due to increases in procedures 
marketing and advertising costs increased primarily due to the saturation marketing program associated with the conversion of our centers to the lasikplus business model 
depreciation and amortization decreased due to write down of goodwill required by our closing of certain acquired centers in other equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates declined because we began accounting for our investment in the baltimore laser sight center  ltd 
using the consolidation method effective july interest expense decreased  due to our reduction of bank borrowing and capital leases obligations 
interest income increased  as a result of our being able to invest funds not required for current operating needs and an increase in interest rates available on such short term investments 
income tax benefit results from the reversal of the valuation allowance required for deferred tax assets 
approximately  of the reversal of the allowance was recorded in our statement of operations as an income tax benefit 
the remaining reversal   was originally required because utilization of the net operating loss nol carryforwards acquired when we bought rcii was not  at that time  more likely than not 
the remaining reversal was recorded as a reduction of unamortized goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet 
preferred stock dividends declined due to the conversion of our convertible preferred stock to common stock 
compared to on august   we purchased of the issued and outstanding common stock of refractive centers international  inc  then a majority owned subsidiary of summit technology  inc  for  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
and interpretations thereof 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include the revenues and expenses of refractive centers international subsequent to august  the increase in direct operating expenses is primarily a result of the expansion of our laser vision correction business 
direct operating expenses comprise the significant fixed costs of performing the procedure as well as the costs of maintaining a facility 
certain of these costs become a lesser percentage of revenue as procedure volume increases 
direct operating expenses related to other sources of revenue are more variable and fluctuate generally with levels of revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased in compared to due to the increase in goodwill and property and equipment  primarily equipment  for the laser vision correction centers acquired from summit 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a plan to restructure operations by closing seven of our centers  primarily acquired centers 
costs associated with the restructuring include million related to the write off of goodwill and leasehold improvements and  for the accrual of lease terminations and employee severance costs 
as a result of the closings  we have certain excimer lasers in storage 
the restructuring provision also includes million related to the write down of these excimer lasers to their net realizable value 
the balance of the accrual at december  was insignificant 
equity in income from unconsolidated businesses increased because of their increased profitability 
interest expense decreased due to significant reduction in debt 
interest income increased because we had cash to invest in overnight cash equivalents 
liquidity and capital resources on june  we sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds approximated  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our offering expenses  including the fee to be listed on the nasdaq national market 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering as follows to extensively market our centers and our lasikplus brand name  to open approximately ten additional laser vision correction centers in the year  to purchase additional equipment  to fund possible future strategic acquisitions  and to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
other sources of liquidity for the next year are expected to be cash generated from operations proceeds from the exercise of stock options credit facility and lease financing  as necessary we generated positive cash flow from operations for the year ended december  this was sufficient to finance our capital expenditures  debt repayment and lease commitments 
our short term investments balance at december  was  of which  was invested in short term  investment grade  interest bearing obligations of us government agencies 
the remaining  is a certificate of deposit  maturing on june   issued by our commercial lender 
during the quarter ended march   all of the outstanding shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and accrued dividends thereon were converted into shares of our common stock 
on july  we paid the cumulative dividends unpaid on our class b preferred stock first and second interim series 
the cash dividend paid was  subsequent to the payment of the dividend  the holders of these shares converted them into  restricted shares of our common stock 
as a result of these conversions we no longer have an expense or a liability for preferred stock dividends 
our line of credit with the provident bank is  at december   the line of credit supports letters of credit totaling  and  is available to us for borrowing 
we also have a  line of credit for the purpose of funding acquisitions 
at december  we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal and state income tax purposes of  and  respectively  which expire in varying amounts from through these operating losses are available to offset future taxable income 
approximately  of the nols were acquired when we bought refractive centers international  inc in august and their use is limited to  per year under section of the internal revenue code 
the utilization of the nol s will substantially reduce our cash obligation for payment of income taxes otherwise due over the next several years 
we have announced the following for the year to open approximately ten new centers under the lasikplus brand name to spend to million on marketing  advertising and promotions 
the ability to fund our marketing and advertising program  planned capital expenditures and new centers rollout depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and short term investments  and available borrowings under the credit facility from provident bank will be adequate to meet these needs 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the price at which our common stock will trade has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuation in our results of operations  changes in or our failure to meet securities analysts expectations  technological innovations  increased competition  conditions and trends in the laser refractive surgery industry  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of healthcare companies  particularly laser vision correction companies 
these broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
laser vision correction may not achieve broad market acceptance which would limit our profitability and growth 
we believe that our profitability and expansion depends largely on acceptance of laser vision correction 
there can be no assurance that laser vision correction will become more widely accepted by ophthalmologists  optometrists or the general population as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
acceptance of laser vision correction may be affected adversely by concerns relating to its safety and effectiveness  general resistance to surgery of any type  the effectiveness of alternate methods of correcting refractive vision disorders  the lack of long term follow up data and the possibility involving patient outcomes from laser vision correction  and regulatory developments 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
future revenue is difficult to forecast and for the foreseeable future will be influenced by the timing and number of procedures performed 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rents  are relatively fixed  and are incurred in part based on expectations of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
because of these factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading of our common stock to decline 
we depend on limited sources of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and disposable blades  and shortages of these items could hinder our ability to increase our procedure volume 
we currently use one supplier  visx  incorporated  for our excimer lasers in the us if visx became unwilling or unable to supply us with excimer lasers  to repair parts or to provide services  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we are primarily dependent on chiron vision  a subsidiary of bausch lomb  incorporated  to provide the microkeratome  blades and other disposable items we provide to ophthalmologists for the most popular type of laser vision correction 
there are a limited number of manufacturers of microkeratomes and there can be no assurance that microkeratomes and microkeratome blades will be available in the quantities or within the time frames we require 
any shortages in our supplies of this equipment could limit our ability to increase our volume of the lasik procedure 
our business may be impaired due to government regulations which could restrict our equipment  services and relationships with ophthalmologists  optometrists  and other healthcare providers 
we and excimer laser manufacturers are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign laws  rules and regulations  including restrictions on the approval  distribution and use of medical devices  anti kickback statutes  fee splitting laws  corporate practice of medicine restrictions  self referral laws  anti fraud provisions  facility license requirements and certificates of need  conflict of interest regulations  and sales and use taxes 
many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous  and courts and regulatory authorities have provided little clarification 
moreover  state and local laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
as a result  we may not always be able to accurately interpret applicable law  and some of our activities could be challenged 
the excimer lasers we use in our centers are medical devices that in the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of the fda 
in addition to fda approval for the initial uses of these excimer lasers  new uses require separate approval 
obtaining such approval can be an expensive and time consuming process  the success of which cannot be guaranteed 
the failure of our suppliers to obtain regulatory approvals for any additional uses of excimer lasers or otherwise comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements could subject us  ophthalmologists who use our centers or excimer laser manufacturers to enforcement actions  including product seizure  recalls  withdrawal of approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
any such enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  or any adverse regulatory action could result in limitations or prohibitions on our use of excimer lasers 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an increase in the number of ophthalmologists who perform enough laser vision correction procedures to economically justify the purchase of their own excimer lasers may harm our business 
as laser vision correction becomes more commonplace  the number of ophthalmologists who can economically justify the purchase of their own excimer laser may increase 
laser vision correction is still a relatively new procedure for most ophthalmologists  and it generally takes time for ophthalmologists to build up their procedure volume 
we estimate that an ophthalmologist or practice group needs to perform approximately procedures a month in one location in order to economically justify the purchase or lease of an excimer laser 
the estimate is based upon a number of factors  including current prices for excimer lasers  current procedure fees charged by ophthalmologists and our current per procedure fee 
this estimate does not take into consideration the value ophthalmologists may place on our marketing and advertising  administrative support  maintenance and other services we provide to ophthalmologists who use our centers 
we could be sued for patient injuries  and such claims could negatively affect our business 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the laser vision correction procedures performed in our centers involve a potential risk of physical injury to patients 
such risk could result in product liability  malpractice or other claims brought against us based upon injuries or alleged injuries associated with a defect in a product s performance or malpractice by an ophthalmologist or technician 
some injuries or defects may not become evident for a number of years 
therefore  the operation of any excimer laser  microkeratome or other equipment may result in substantial claims against us by patients who allege they were injured as a result of vision correction procedures 
although we have umbrella product and professional liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  we primarily rely and intend to continue to rely on ophthalmologists professional liability insurance policies and manufacturers insurance policies for product liability coverage 
we require the ophthalmologists who use our centers to maintain certain levels of professional liability insurance 
we cannot assure you that these ophthalmologists will continue to be able to obtain sufficient insurance 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements information contained above in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report on form k with respect to expected financial results and future events and trends is forward looking  based on our estimates and assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk
