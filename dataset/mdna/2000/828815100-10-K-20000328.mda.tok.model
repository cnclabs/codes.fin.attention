general the company is a full service promotional marketing company  specializing in the design and development of high impact promotional products and programs 
the majority of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of products to consumer product companies seeking to promote their brand and build customer loyalty as well as products sold to consumers under certain license agreements 
the company s business is heavily concentrated with mcdonald s corporation mcdonald s and philip morris incorporated philip morris  as well as sales associated with its license arrangement with ty inc ty  the world s largest manufacturer and marketer of plush toys sold under the name beanie babies 
net sales to mcdonald s and philip morris accounted for and  and and and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
sales of beanie babies related products accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
sales to pepsi cola company pepsi accounted for of net sales 
the company s agreements with pepsi were terminated in december the company s business with mcdonald s and philip morris as well as other promotional customers is based upon purchase orders placed from time to time during the course of promotions 
there are no written agreements which commit them to make a certain level of purchases 
the actual level of purchases depends on a number of factors  including the duration of the promotion and consumer redemption rates 
consequently  the company s level of net sales is difficult to predict accurately and can fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter 
the company expects that a significant percentage of its net sales in will be to mcdonald s and philip morris 
philip morris solicits competitive bids for its promotional programs 
the company s profit margin depends  to a great extent  on its competitive position when bidding and its ability to manage its costs after being awarded bids 
increased competition is expected to continue and may adversely impact the company s profit margin on philip morris promotions in the future 
beginning july   a settlement agreement among states and certain tobacco companies  including philip morris  prohibits the use of brand names by tobacco companies in connection with promotional programs relating to tobacco products 
the settlement agreement  however  does not prohibit the use of philip morris s corporate name in promotional programs 
due to the restrictions on the use of brand names  and the other limitations imposed by the settlement agreement on the tobacco industry  the settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business with philip morris and on its results of operations 
in september  the company agreed with mcdonald s that the company would no longer provide administrative services in connection with mcdonald s promotional programs in europe effective january  the fees for these services have historically not been material to the overall results of operations 
as a result of this action  the company s total sales will decline by approximately from current levels 
however  because the agreement with mcdonald s related to these services did not provide for significant gross margin on associated sales  the company believes that the absence of these sales will have no material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
in december  the company entered into a license agreement the agreement with ty which granted the company the exclusive right to develop and market licensed beanie babies products in connection with the beanie babies official club  a consumer membership kit 
in may  the parties mutually agreed to modify the agreement and to enter into a new arrangement in which the company s rights in connection with the beanie babies official club are non exclusive in order to enable ty to market and distribute beanie babies products in connection with the club and in cooperation with the company commencing in july under the new arrangement which extended through the end of  the company would provide creative and sourcing services for ty in collaboration with ty 
in  the company s seasonal pattern of sales and earnings  including a loss in the first quarter  and significant revenues and profitability in the second half of the year  was primarily attributed to the sale of ty beanie babies product 
effective january   the company is a strategic marketing agent for ty and will provide ty advisory  design  development and or creative services on a project by project basis 
given that the company is providing these services on a project by project basis  the company s future revenues and earnings associated with the ty relationship are difficult to predict 
the company  however  expects sales of ty related products in to be substantially less than the volume  and that such sales will be heavily weighted to the latter half of the year 
as a result of timing associated with potential ty activity and consistent with the seasonal nature of other client promotional activity  the company announced in february that it would incur an operating loss in the first quarter of at december   the company had written purchase orders for million as compared to million at december  the company s purchase orders are generally subject to cancellation with limited penalty and are also subject to agreements with certain customers that limit gross margin levels 
therefore  the company cautions that the backlog amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future revenues or earnings
