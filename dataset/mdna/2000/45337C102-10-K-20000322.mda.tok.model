overview incyte pharmaceuticals  inc incyte and  together with its wholly owned subsidiaries  the company designs  develops and markets genomic information based products and services 
these products and services include database products  genomic data management software tools  microarray based gene expression services  genomic reagents  and related services 
the company s genomic databases integrate bioinformatics software with proprietary and  when appropriate  publicly available genetic information to create information based products and services used by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic researchers in the understanding of disease and the discovery and development of new drugs 
revenues recognized by the company consist primarily of non exclusive database access fees related to database agreements 
revenues also include the sales of genomic screening products and services  fees for microarray based gene expression services  fees for contract sequencing services  and sales of genomic data management software tools 
the company s database agreements provide for future milestone payments and royalties from the sale of products derived from proprietary information obtained through the databases 
there can be no assurance that any database subscriber will ever generate products from information contained within the databases and thus that the company will ever receive additional milestone payments or royalties 
the company s ability to maintain and increase revenues will be dependent upon its ability to obtain additional database subscribers  retain existing subscribers  and to expand its product and service offerings and expand its customer base for microarray services 
the loss of revenues from any individual database agreement  if terminated or not renewed  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  although it is not anticipated to have a material adverse impact on the company s business or financial conditions 
the company intends to invest in its sequencing  bioinformatics  expression database development and snp discovery programs in and as a result expects to report a net loss at least through if the costs of these programs are greater than anticipated  or if these programs take longer to complete  or if losses are incurred from strategic investments  the company may incur losses in future periods  as well 
the company has made and intends to continue to make strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to the businesses of the company 
as a result  the company may record losses or expenses related to the company s proportionate ownership interest in such long term equity investments  record charges for the acquisition of in process technologies  or record charges for the recognition of the impairment in the value of the securities underlying such investments 
in september  the company completed the acquisition of hexagen limited hexagen  a privately held snp discovery company based in cambridge  england 
the company issued  shares of its common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of hexagen s outstanding capital stock 
in addition  the company assumed hexagen s stock options  which if fully vested and exercised  would amount to  shares of its common stock 
the intrinsic value of the stock options was included in the purchase price of hexagen 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase with a portion of the purchase price  estimated to be approximately million  expensed in the third quarter of as a charge for the purchase of in process research and development 
the remainder of the purchase price  approximately million  was allocated to goodwill million  developed technology million  and hexagen s assembled work force million  which are being amortized over  and years  respectively 
the company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company allocated hexagen s purchase price based on the relative fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in performing this allocation  the company considered  among other factors  the technology research and development projects in process at the date of acquisition 
hexagen s in process research and development program consisted of the development of its fsscp technology for snp discovery 
in  the company completed the development of the fsscp technology 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to value the assets of hexagen 
in january  the company completed the acquisition of synteni  inc synteni  a privately held microarray based gene expression company 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  and the consolidated financial statements discussed herein and all historical financial information have been restated to reflect the combined operations of both companies 
in september  the company formed a joint venture  diadexus  llc diadexus  with smithkline beecham corporation sb which will utilize genomic and bioinformatics technologies in the discovery and commercialization of molecular diagnostics 
the company and sb each hold a percent equity interest in diadexus 
the investment is accounted for under the equity method  and the company records its share of diadexus earnings and losses in its statement of operations 
in january  the company announced a relationship relating to the joint development of proteomics data and related software with oxford glycosciences plc ogs 
as part of this relationship  the company made a million initial equity investment and a follow on investment in april of approximately million as part of the ogs initial public offering of its ordinary shares 
as part of the collaborative agreement  the company reimbursed ogs million in for services rendered and will reimburse ogs up to million in if revenues are not sufficient to offset ogs expenses for services rendered 
the market prices of the securities of the companies in which the company invests are highly volatile and therefore subject to declines in market value 
the company will continue to evaluate its long term equity investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
in an effort to broaden its business  the company is investing in a number of new areas  including molecular diagnostics  genome sequencing  snp discovery  proteomics  and microarray services 
given that many of these address new markets  or involve untested technologies  it is not known if any of them will generate revenues or if the revenues will be sufficient to provide an adequate return on the investment 
depending on the investment required and the timing of such investments  expenses or losses related to these investments could adversely affect operating results 
the company has incurred and could continue to incur substantial expenses in its defense of the lawsuits filed in january and september by affymetrix  inc affymetrix alleging patent infringement by synteni and incyte 
affymetrix seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining incyte and synteni from using certain microarray technology in a manner alleged to infringe an affymetrix patent and a permanent injunction enjoining incyte and synteni from further infringement of certain affymetrix patents 
in addition  affymetrix seeks damages  costs  attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix further requests that any such damages be trebled on its allegation of willful infringement by incyte and synteni 
incyte and synteni believe they have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these suits vigorously 
however  there can be no assurance that incyte and synteni will be successful in the defense of these suits 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss related to these suits due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
regardless of the outcome  this litigation has resulted and is expected to continue to result in substantial expenses and diversion of the efforts of management and technical personnel 
any future litigation could result in similar expenses and diversion of efforts 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of these suits or the outcome thereof would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations the company recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million and net income for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
on a per share basis  basic and diluted net loss was for the year ended december  basic and diluted net income per share was and for the year ended december   respectively and and for the year ended december   respectively 
excluding acquisition related charges  the company recorded net income of million  and basic and diluted net income per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december  the net income per share in reflects the dilutive effect of approximately million shares issued in an august follow on public offering 
the net income per share for and reflects the issuance of approximately million shares in january in connection with the company s business combination with synteni 
all share and per share data have been adjusted retroactively for a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on november  to holders of record on october  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
revenues resulted primarily from database access fees and  to a much lesser extent  from microarray based gene expression services  genomic screening products and services  fees for contract sequencing  and sales of genomic data management software tools and maintenance 
the increase in revenues from year to year was predominantly driven by expanded database agreements with existing customers  new database customers and increased revenues from microarray related products and services 
expenses 
total costs and expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
total costs and expenses for the year ended december  included a one time charge of million for the purchase of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of hexagen  and acquisition related expenses of million related to the combination with synteni 
total costs and expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future due to the continued investment in new products and services 
research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase from over resulted primarily from the company s genomic sequencing  genetic mapping  and snp discovery initiatives that were initiated in the second half of  the company s collaboration with ogs in proteomics  the increase in microarray production  and the costs related to intellectual property protection 
the increase in research and development expenses in over resulted primarily from an increase in bioinformatics and software development efforts and to a lesser extent microarray production capacity  and from costs related to genomic sequencing  genetic mapping  snp discovery efforts  technology development initiatives  and intellectual property protection 
the company expects research and development spending to increase as the company continues to pursue the development of new database products and services  including expression databases  expansion of existing database products  increases in sequencing  bioinformatics  expression database development and snp discovery operations  and investments in new technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from the growth in sales and marketing activities and the increased personnel to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from the growth in sales and marketing activities and to a lesser extent the expansion of the company s united kingdom operations and increased personnel to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
the company s and operations were also impacted by legal expenses related to the patent infringement lawsuits filed by affymetrix of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company expects that total selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase  primarily due to continued growth in marketing  sales and customer support and expenses to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
the increase in over was primarily due to increased interest income from higher average combined cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and an increase in realized gains on the sale of marketable securities 
losses from joint venture 
losses from joint venture were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss represents the company s share of diadexus losses from operations 
the loss in was net of million of amortization of the excess of the company s share of diadexus net assets over its basis 
income taxes 
the company had an effective income tax benefit rate of in the benefit was primarily due to the carryback of the current year net operating loss 
the effective tax rate for was  excluding the charge for the purchase of in process research and development  and for was  which represents the provision of federal and state alternative minimum taxes after utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase from to in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the company s expectation that it would fully utilize all federal net operating loss carryforwards available to benefit the income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  the company has classified all of its marketable securities as short term  as the company may choose not to hold its marketable securities until maturity in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
available cash is invested in accordance with the company s investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million and million for the years ended december  and the change in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily due to the company s investments in genomic sequencing  mapping  bioinformatics and snp discovery resulting in a net loss in as compared to net income in  and the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the increase in net income before non cash charges and the decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by the increase in prepaid and other assets and the decrease in deferred revenues 
the company s investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and net purchases of long term investments 
capital expenditures for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures increased in and primarily due to investments in computer and laboratory equipment as well as leasehold improvements related to the expansion of the company s facilities 
long term investments in companies with which the company has research and development agreements were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the company liquidated its investment in two such companies  resulting in proceeds of million and a net realized gain of million 
in  the company paid million  net of cash received  in connection with the purchase of hexagen and in transferred million to restricted cash for disbursement to diadexus in accordance with the diadexus joint venture agreement 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  capital expenditures and maturity sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to proceeds from follow on public stock offerings in august  while net cash provided by financing activities in and was due to the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
subsequent to december   the company raised additional funds in two financing transactions 
in february  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
beginning may   the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
also in february  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net proceeds from the sale of those shares were million 
the company expects its cash requirements to increase in as it invests in its sequencing  bioinformatics  expression database development  and snp discovery programs  invests in data processing related computer hardware to support its existing and new database products and to enable the on line delivery of those products  continues to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  makes strategic investments  and continues to make improvements in existing facilities 
based upon its current plans  the company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company s cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the ability of the company to attract and retain collaborators for its databases and other products and services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure the company s sequencing and microarray operations remain competitive  capital expenditures required to expand the company s facilities  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of the company s capital resources 
euro conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legacy currencies and the euro were established as of that date 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january   but not later than july  during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legal currency 
this conversion to the euro had no material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the euro on its computer and financial systems  business processes  market risk  and price competition 
factors that may affect results we have had only limited periods of profitability and we expect to incur losses in the future  which may prevent us from returning to profitability we had net losses from inception in through  reported net income in and  and again incurred a net loss in because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we intend to make significant investments in sequencing  bioinformatics  expression database development and single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  discovery over the next year 
as a result  we expect to report a net loss for the year ending december  we may report net losses in future periods as well 
we expect that our expenditures may continue to increase in due in part to our continued investment in new product and technology development  including the continuation of our genomic sequencing  bioinformatics  expression database development  snp discovery programs  obligations under existing and future research and development alliances  and our increasing investment in marketing  sales and customer service 
our profitability depends on our ability to increase our revenues to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional database collaborators and retain existing collaborators 
while we had over database agreements as of december   we may be unable to enter into any additional agreements 
also  our database collaborators may choose not to renew their agreements upon expiration 
in  for the first time one of our lifeseq gold database collaborators did not renew its subscription 
our database revenues are also affected by the extent to which existing collaborators expand their agreements with us to include our new database products and to the extent that existing collaborators reduce the number of products or services for which they subscribe 
some of our database agreements require us to meet performance obligations 
a database collaborator can terminate its agreement before the end of its scheduled term if we breach the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a specified period 
our revenues and profitability will also depend on our ability to generate profits from expression databases and microarray services 
we acquired synteni  inc in january to provide microarray services and to generate information for expression databases 
the contribution of our microarray operations to our operating results will depend on whether we can continue to obtain high volume customers for microarray services and expression databases  whether we can continue to increase our microarray production capacity in a timely manner and with consistent volumes and quality  and the costs associated with increasing our microarray production capacity 
we do not expect milestone or royalty payments to substantially contribute to revenues for several years 
part of our strategy is to license to database collaborators our know how and patent rights associated with the gene sequences and related information in our proprietary databases  for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical  diagnostic or other products 
any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further development  clinical testing and regulatory approval before commercialization 
our operating results are unpredictable and may adversely impact our stock price our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors  including changes in the demand for our products and services  the introduction of competitive databases or services  including public domain databases  the pricing of access to our databases  the nature  pricing and timing of other products and services provided to our collaborators  changes in the research and development budgets of our collaborators and potential collaborators  depreciation expense from capital expenditures  acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  including operating losses of acquired businesses such as synteni and hexagen  losses and expenses related to our investments in joint ventures and businesses  including our proportionate share of operating losses of our diadexus  llc  joint venture with smithkline beecham corporation  payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our increasing number of external alliances  and expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights including the lawsuits filed by affymetrix  inc described below 
in particular  revenues from our database business are unpredictable because the timing of our database installations is determined by our collaborators  the sales cycle for our database products is lengthy  and the time required to complete custom orders can vary significantly 
we expect our expression databases to represent an increasing amount of our revenues 
also  revenues may be affected by developments in the affymetrix litigation  which may cause potential customers to postpone or change their decision to use our microarray services 
we are investing in a number of new areas to try to broaden our business 
these areas include sequencing  bioinformatics  gene expression databases  snp discovery  molecular diagnostics  proteomics  or the large scale  high throughput analysis of protein expression  and the online delivery of our database and software products 
because many of these address new markets or involve untested technologies  they may not generate any revenues or provide an adequate return on our investment 
in these cases  we may have to recognize expenses or losses 
we have significant fixed expenses  due in part to our need to continue to invest in product development and extensive support for our database collaborators 
we may be unable to adjust our expenditures if revenues in a particular period fail to meet our expectations  which would adversely affect our operating results for that period 
forecasting operating and integration expenses for acquired businesses may be particularly difficult  especially where the acquired business focuses on technologies that do not have an established market 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price will likely fall  possibly by a significant amount 
we experience intense competition and rapid technological change and if we do not compete effectively our revenues may decline genomic businesses are intensely competitive 
the human genome contains a finite number of genes 
our competitors may seek to identify  sequence and determine the biological function of numerous genes in order to obtain a proprietary position with respect to new genes 
a number of companies  other institutions and government financed entities are engaged in gene sequencing  gene discovery  gene expression analysis  positional cloning  the study of genetic variation  and other genomic service businesses 
many of these companies  institutions and entities have greater financial and human resources than we do 
some of our competitors have developed databases containing gene sequence  gene expression  genetic variation or other genomic information and are marketing or plan to market their data to pharmaceutical companies 
additional competitors may attempt to establish databases containing this information in the future 
we expect that competition in our industry will continue to intensify 
several large pharmaceutical companies have formed a consortium to create a snps database and to make all of the information publicly available 
the formation of this consortium could delay or reduce the potential revenues related to our snp related business 
patent positions or public disclosures may reduce the value of our databases 
competitors may discover and establish patent positions with respect to gene sequences in our databases 
further  certain entities engaged in gene sequencing have made the results of their sequencing efforts publicly available 
in january  the celera genomics group of pe corporation announced that it has dna sequence in its database that covers of the human genome and plans to complete the sequencing of the human genome by the summer of celera has announced that it has filed a provisional patent application on newly discovered partial genes and stated its intention to file full applications on medically important discoveries 
the human genome project  which is coordinated by the us department of energy and the national institutes of health  has announced that a consortium of laboratories associated with the project predicts that they will produce at least of the human genome sequence in a working draft form by the spring of and that they intend to make the information publicly available 
the public availability of gene sequences or resulting patent positions covering substantial portions of the human genome or microbial or plant genomes could reduce the potential value of our databases to our collaborators 
it could also impair our ability to realize royalties or other revenue from any commercialized products based on this genetic information 
competitors may develop superior technology 
the gene sequencing machines used in our computer aided sequencing operations are commercially available and are being used by at least one competitor 
in addition  some of our competitors and potential competitors are developing proprietary sequencing technologies that may be more advanced than ours 
pe corporation began commercial shipments of a new gel based sequencing machine  of which a large number have been provided to celera genomics group 
we may be unable to obtain access to sufficient quantities of these machines on acceptable terms 
in addition  a number of companies are pursuing alternative methods for generating gene expression information  including microarray technologies 
these advanced sequencing or gene expression technologies may not be commercially available for us to purchase or license on reasonable terms  if at all 
at least one other company currently offers microarray based services that might be competitive with ours 
our snp discovery platform represents a modification of a process that is in the public domain 
we are seeking patent protection for these improvements  but have not yet received any patents 
other companies could make similar or superior improvements to this process without infringing our rights  and we may not have access to those improvements 
the discovery of snps is a competitive area 
other companies may develop or obtain access to different snp discovery platforms  to which we may not have access  that may make our technology obsolete 
we also face competition from providers of software 
a number of companies have announced their intent to develop and market software to assist pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers in managing and analyzing their own genomic data and publicly available data 
we must continue to invest in new technologies 
the genomics industry is characterized by extensive research efforts  resulting in rapid technological progress 
to remain competitive  we must continue to expand our databases  improve our software  and invest in new technologies 
new developments are expected to continue  and discoveries by others may render our services and potential products noncompetitive 
we are involved in patent litigation  which if not resolved favorably could harm our business in january  affymetrix filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging infringement of us patent number  by both synteni and incyte 
the complaint alleges that the patent has been infringed by synteni s and incyte s making  using  selling  importing  distributing or offering to sell high density arrays in the united states and that this infringement was willful 
affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining synteni and incyte from further infringement of the patent and seeks damages  costs  attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix also requests triple damages based on allegedly willful infringement 
in september  affymetrix filed an additional lawsuit alleging infringement of us patent numbers  and  by synteni and incyte 
the complaint alleges that the patent has been infringed by synteni s and incyte s making  using  selling  importing  distributing or offering to sell high density arrays in the united states 
it also alleges that the patent has been infringed by the use of synteni s and incyte s gem microarray technology to conduct gene expression monitoring using two color labeling and that this infringement was willful 
affymetrix had sought a preliminary injunction enjoining synteni and incyte from using gem microarray technology to conduct this kind of gene expression monitoring  and a permanent injunction enjoining synteni and incyte from further infringing the and patents 
the lawsuits were initially filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in november  the court granted incyte s motion to transfer the suits to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
affymetrix s request for a preliminary injunction was denied in april as a result of the assignment of the case to a new judge  all scheduled trial and pretrial dates have been vacated 
the court is expected to set a new schedule in late april in april  the board of patent appeals and interferences of united states patent and trademark office declared interferences between pending patent applications licensed exclusively to us and the affymetrix and patents 
an interference proceeding is invoked by the patent and trademark office when more than one patent applicant claims the same invention 
the board of patent appeals and interferences evaluates all relevant facts  including those bearing on first to invent  validity  enablement and scope of claims  and then makes a determination as to who  if anyone  is entitled to the patent on the disputed invention 
in september  the board of patent appeals and interferences determined that incyte had not met its prima facie case  and ruled that patents licensed by incyte and synteni from stanford university were not entitled to priority over corresponding claims in the two affymetrix patents 
we are seeking de novo review of the board decisions in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these suits vigorously 
however  our defense may be unsuccessful 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss resulting from these suits due to uncertainty about the ultimate outcome 
we have spent and expect to continue to spend a significant amount of money and management time on this litigation 
also  if we are required to license any technology as a result of these suits  we do not know whether we will be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we spend a substantial amount of money on new and uncertain businesses and demand for our products and services may be insufficient to cover our costs  which could impact our profitability there is no precedent for our microarray based gene expression database or service businesses or the use of snp based genetic variation information 
the usefulness of the information generated by these businesses is unproven 
our collaborators and potential collaborators may determine that our databases  software tools and microarray related services are not useful or cost effective 
due to the nature and price of some of the products and services we offer  only a limited number of companies are potential collaborators for those products and services 
if we do not develop these new products and services in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products and services  we may not be able to cover our costs of developing these products and services or earn a sufficient return on our investment 
additional factors that may affect demand for our products and services include the extent to which pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies conduct these activities in house or through industry consortia  the emergence of competitors offering similar services at competitive prices  the extent to which the information in our databases is made public or is covered by others patents  our ability to establish and enforce proprietary rights to our products  regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  and technological innovations that are more advanced than the technologies that we have developed or that are available to us 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our new programs relating to the role of genetic variation in disease and drug response may never generate significant revenues or profitable operations we recently began to focus part of our business on developing databases and other products and services to assist pharmaceutical companies in a new and unproven area the identification and correlation of genetic variation to disease and drug response 
we will incur significant costs over the next several years in expanding our research and development in this area 
these activities may never generate significant revenues or profitable operations 
this new aspect of our business will focus on snps  one type of genetic variation 
the role of snps in disease and drug response is not fully understood  and relatively few  if any  therapeutic or diagnostic products based on snps have been developed and commercialized 
among other things  demand in this area may be adversely affected by ethical and social concerns about the confidentiality of patient specific genetic information and about the use of genetic testing for diagnostic purposes 
except for a few anecdotal examples  there is no proof that snps have any correlation to diseases or a patient s response to a particular drug or class of drug 
identifying statistically significant correlations is time consuming and could involve the collection and screening of a large number of patient samples 
we do not know if the snps we have discovered to date are suitable for these correlation studies 
nor do we currently have access to the patient samples needed or technology allowing us to rapidly and cost effectively identify pre determined snps in large numbers of patients 
most snps may occur too infrequently to warrant their use in analyzing patients genetic variation 
we may have trouble identifying snps that both correlate with diseases or drug responses and occur frequently enough to justify their use by pharmaceutical companies 
our success will also depend upon our ability to develop  use and enhance new and relatively unproven technologies 
our strategy of using high throughput mutation detection processes and sequencing to identify snps and genes rapidly is unproven 
among other things  we will need to continue to improve the throughput of our snp discovery technology 
we may not be able to achieve these necessary improvements  and other factors may impair our ability to develop our snp related products and services in time to be competitively available 
our strategic investments may result in losses and other adverse effects we make strategic investments in joint ventures or businesses that complement our business 
these investments  such as our investment in diadexus  may often be made in securities lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions  either of which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment  require us to record losses and expenses related to our ownership interest  require us to record charges related to the acquisition of in process technologies or for the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our investment  and require us to invest greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to the management of research and development relationships and joint ventures 
the market values of many of these investments fluctuate significantly 
we evaluate our long term equity investments for impairment of their values on a quarterly basis 
impairment could result in future charges to our earnings 
these losses and expenses may exceed the amounts that we anticipated 
our sales cycle is lengthy and there is no guarantee that a subscription or services agreement will result our ability to obtain new subscribers for our databases  software tools and microarray and other services depends upon prospective subscribers perceptions that our products and services can help accelerate drug discovery efforts 
our database sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential subscribers and sell the benefits of our tools and services to a variety of constituencies within potential subscriber companies 
in addition  each database subscription and microarray services agreement involves the negotiation of unique terms 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that a subscription or services agreement will result 
actual and proposed consolidations of pharmaceutical companies have affected the timing and progress of our sales efforts 
we expect that future proposed consolidations will have similar effects 
patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protection of our proprietary information and our inability to protect a patent or other proprietary right may impact our business and operating results we may be unable to protect our proprietary information  which may result in unauthorized use and a loss of revenue 
our business and competitive position depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary database information and software technology  but our strategy of obtaining proprietary rights in as many genes and snps as possible is unproven 
despite our efforts to protect this information and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
although our database subscription agreements require our subscribers to control access to our databases  policing unauthorized use of our databases and software may be difficult 
we pursue a policy of having our employees  consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  otherwise gain access to our proprietary information  or design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
our patent applications may conflict with others 
our current policy is to file patent applications on what we believe to be novel full length and partial gene sequences obtained through our gene sequencing efforts 
we have filed us patent applications in which we have claimed certain partial gene sequences 
we have also applied for patents in the us and other countries claiming full length gene sequences associated with cells and tissues involved in our gene sequencing program 
we hold a number of issued us patents on full length genes and one issued us patent claiming multiple partial gene sequences 
a number of entities make certain gene sequences publicly available  which may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents on those genes 
we believe that some of our patent applications claim genes that may also be claimed in patent applications filed by others 
in some or all of these applications  a determination of priority of inventorship may need to be decided in an interference before the united states patent and trademark office 
enforcement of gene patents is uncertain and gene patents may be found unenforceable  resulting in a loss of competitive benefit 
one of our strategies is to obtain proprietary rights in as many genes including partial gene sequences and snps as possible 
while the uspto has issued patents covering full length genes  partial gene sequences and snps  we do not know whether or how courts may enforce those patents  if that becomes necessary 
if a court finds these types of inventions to be unpatentable  or interprets them narrowly  the benefits of our strategy may not materialize 
we may decide to abandon patent applications  which could diminish the value of our patent portfolio and possibly our future revenues 
the uspto has had a substantial backlog of biotechnology patent applications  particularly those claiming gene sequences 
in  the uspto issued guidelines limiting the number of partial gene sequences that can be examined within a single patent application 
many of our patent applications contain more partial sequences than the maximum number allowed under these guidelines 
due to the resources needed to comply with the guidelines  we may decide to abandon patent applications for some of our partial gene sequences 
because filing large numbers of patent applications and maintaining issued patents can be very costly  we may choose not to pursue every application 
if we do not pursue patent protection for all of our full length and partial gene sequences  the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be diminished 
because of the possible delay in obtaining allowance of some of our patent applications  and the secrecy of patent applications  we do not know if other applications having priority over ours have been filed 
we may need to refile some of our patent applications and the period of patent protection has been shortened  which may affect our potential revenues and profits 
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
the us patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection from years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the average time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications is at least one year and may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection  which may adversely affect our rights under any patents that we obtain 
we may need to refile applications claiming large numbers of gene sequences and  in these situations  the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity 
international patent protection is particularly uncertain  and opposition proceedings in foreign countries may be costly and divert management resources 
biotechnology patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
we may be subject to additional litigation and infringement claims that could be costly and disrupt our business the technology that we use to develop our products  and those that we incorporate in our products  may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
the risk of this occurring will tend to increase as the genomics  biotechnology and software industries expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and snps and engage in other genomic related businesses 
as is typical in the genomics  biotechnology and software industries  we have received  and we will probably receive in the future  notices from third parties alleging patent infringement 
we believe that we are not infringing the patent rights of any such third party 
except for affymetrix  no third party has filed a patent lawsuit against us 
we may  however  be involved in future lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can be very costly and can divert management s efforts 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses to other parties patents or proprietary rights 
we may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling our products 
further  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may encounter problems in meeting customers software needs  which could adversely impact our revenues and the goodwill of our customers our databases also require software support and will need to incorporate features determined by database collaborators 
if we experience delays or difficulties in implementing our database software or collaborator requested features  we may be unable to service our collaborators 
past acquisitions have and any future acquisitions that we may make could adversely affect our operations or financial results as part of our business strategy  we may acquire other assets  technologies and businesses 
we acquired synteni in january and hexagen in september these and any future acquisitions involve risks such as the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting management s time and attention  we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired  due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  we may incur amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  and our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses that are not located near our palo alto  california headquarters  we may experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth  which may impact our ability to optimize our resources we expect to continue to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems and to hire  train and manage our employees 
in addition  we must continue to invest in customer support resources as the number of database collaborators and their requests for support increase 
our database collaborators typically have worldwide operations and may require support at multiple us and foreign sites 
to provide this support  we may need to open offices in addition to our palo alto  california headquarters and our offices in fremont  california  st 
louis  missouri and cambridge  england  which could result in additional burdens on our systems and resources 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would materially affect our business we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff  including roy a 
whitfield  our chief executive officer  and randal w 
scott  our president and chief scientific officer 
the loss of either of these persons services may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have not entered into any employment agreement with either of these persons and do not maintain a key person life insurance policy on the life of any employee 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific  software  bioinformatics and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing and sales staff 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
our inability to obtain necessary equipment  supplies and data from third parties may adversely impact our results we rely on a small number of suppliers of gene sequencing machines and reagents required for gene sequencing 
although we are evaluating alternative gene sequencing machines  they may not be available in sufficient quantities or at acceptable costs 
in addition  if a third party claims that our use of these machines infringes their patent rights  our use of these machines could become more costly or could be prevented 
if we are unable to obtain additional machines or an adequate supply of reagents or other materials at commercially reasonable rates  our ability to identify genes and snps would be adversely affected 
we rely on outside sources for tissue samples from which we isolate genetic material used in our operations 
our business could be adversely affected if we lose access to some of these sources  or if they charged us higher access fees or imposed tighter restrictions on our use of the information generated from the samples 
we cannot control the performance of collaborators 
we may enter into research and development relationships with corporate and academic collaborators and others 
the success of these relationships depends upon third parties performance of their responsibilities 
our ability to develop these relationships is uncertain  and any established relationships may prove unsuccessful 
our collaborators may also be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
we rely on third party data sources 
we rely on scientific and other data supplied by others  including our academic collaborators and sources of tissue samples 
this data could contain errors or other defects  which could corrupt our databases 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that our data sources acquired this information in compliance with legal requirements 
if either of these happen and become known  our business prospects could be adversely affected 
our activities involve hazardous materials and may subject us to costly environmental liability our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations and currently do not expect to make material additional capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
however  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
our revenues are derived primarily from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as to the academic community 
accordingly  our success will depend in large part upon the success of the companies within these industries and their demand for our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries or by the academic community 
these reductions and delays may result from factors such as changes in economic conditions  consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  changes in the regulatory environment affecting health care and health care providers  pricing pressures  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
these factors are not within our control 
our business could be interrupted by natural disasters we conduct our sequencing and a significant portion of our other activities at our facilities in palo alto  california  and conduct our microarray related activities at our facilities in fremont  california 
both locations are in a seismically active area 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  we do not have or plan to obtain earthquake insurance 
a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow we have substantial amounts of outstanding indebtedness  primarily the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in february as a result of this indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations have increased substantially 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in short term marketable securities and its note payable 
the company s investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
as of december   investments in marketable securities were million 
at december   the company had a fixed rate note payable balance of million 
due to the nature of these investments and note  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments and long term investments  entered into to further its business and strategic objectives 
these investments are in small capitalization stocks in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry sector  in companies with which the company has research and development or licensing agreements 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
as of december   long term investments  excluding diadexus  were million 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
management does not believe that the company s exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is material
