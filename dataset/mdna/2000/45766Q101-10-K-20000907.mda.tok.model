the company s strategy is to further develop and expand regional diagnostic imaging networks that emphasize quality of care  produce cost effective diagnostic information and provide superior service and convenience to its customers 
the strategy of the company is focused on the following components i to further participate in the consolidation occurring in the diagnostic imaging industry by continuing to build its market presence in its existing regional diagnostic imaging networks through geographically disciplined acquisitions  ii to develop or acquire additional regional networks in strategic locations where the company can offer a broad range of services to its customers and realize increased economies of scale  iii to continue to market current diagnostic imaging applications through its existing facilities to optimize and increase overall procedure volume  iv to strengthen the regional diagnostic imaging networks by focusing on managed care customers  and v to implement a variety of new products and services designed to further leverage its core business strengths  including open mri systems and the radiology co source product which involves the joint ownership and management of the physical and technical operations of a single or multi modality facility on a hospital campus 
the company believes that long term viability is contingent upon its ability to successfully execute its business strategy 
in fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions as follows a interest in a partnership which owns four centers and two fixed facilities in buffalo  new york  and a interest in three centers and two fixed facilities in phoenix  arizona 
the aggregate purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately million  subject to certain earn out provisions relating to the buffalo  new york acquisition 
in fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions as follows two fixed facilities in indianapolis and clarksville  indiana  respectively  and a interest in a partnership which owns a center in wilkes barre  pennsylvania 
the aggregate purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately million 
in fiscal  the company opened the following its second radiology co source outpatient fixed facility in granada hills  california  its third radiology co source outpatient center in henderson  nevada  and an open mri fixed facility in pleasanton  california 
these were financed through both capital leases with ge and internally generated funds 
in fiscal  the company closed an open mri fixed facility in atlanta  georgia 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company opened its fourth radiology co source fixed facility in marina del rey  california  which was financed with a capital lease from ge and a pet fixed facility in louisville  kentucky  which was financed with outside financing 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company operates in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of working capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development expenses of new operations and yet is constantly under external pressure to contain costs and reduce prices 
revenues and cash flows have been adversely affected by an increased collection cycle  competitive pressures and major restructurings within the health care industry 
this adverse effect on revenues and cash flow is expected to continue 
the company continues to pursue acquisition opportunities 
the company believes that the expansion of its business through acquisitions is a key factor in improving profitability 
generally  acquisition opportunities are aimed at increasing revenues and operating income  and maximizing utilization of existing capacity 
incremental operating income resulting from future acquisitions will vary depending on geographic location  whether facilities are mobile or fixed  the range of services provided and the company s ability to integrate the acquired businesses into its existing infrastructure 
since  the company has completed twelve acquisitions 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and thereafter complete such acquisitions on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  the company s acquisition facility has expired  and until alternate financing sources can be arranged  the company will have to utilize its own internally generated funds to complete future acquisitions  as discussed below 
the company has outstanding million of senior subordinated notes notes 
the notes mature in june  with interest payable semi annually and are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after june  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the company and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness  as defined in the indenture  of the company  including borrowings under the bank financing described below 
the terms of the notes contain certain restrictions on the company s ability to take certain actions without first obtaining consent of the noteholders 
the company also has the following credit facilities with bank of america  na i a million term loan which matures in june  ii a million working capital facility which expires in june  and iii a million acquisition facility which matures in june  the availability of which expired on june  bank financing 
borrowings under the bank financing bear interest at libor plus 
the company is required to pay an annual unused facility fee of  payable quarterly  on unborrowed amounts under the working capital facility 
the company paid approximately million during the year ended june  for unused facility fees on unborrowed amounts under the working capital and acquisition facilities 
at june   there was approximately million and million in borrowings under the term loan and the acquisition facilities  respectively  however  there were no borrowings under the working capital facility 
the company did not completely utilize the acquisition facility prior to its expiration and until alternate financing sources can be arranged  the company will have to utilize its own internally generated funds to complete future acquisitions 
as of june   the company had cash on hand of approximately million  which it may utilize to consummate such acquisitions 
as of august   the company had borrowing availability of approximately million under the working capital facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended june  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization approximately million and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses approximately million 
the increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses is due primarily to approximately million in equipment costs for the delivery of three mobile facilities in june the increase was offset by an increase in trade accounts receivables approximately million and an increase in other current assets approximately million 
the increase in trade accounts receivables is due primarily to the company s acquisition and development activities 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the i company purchasing or upgrading diagnostic imaging equipment at its existing facilities approximately million  ii the acquisitions described above approximately million  and iii purchasing or upgrading diagnostic imaging equipment at the facilities acquired in fiscal and described above approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   resulting primarily from net borrowings under the working capital and acquisition facilities approximately million  offset by principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations approximately million 
the company has committed to purchase or lease in connection with the development of new mobile facilities and replacement of diagnostic imaging equipment at centers  fixed and mobile facilities  at an aggregate cost of approximately million  mri systems for delivery through december  the company expects to use either internally generated funds or leases from ge to finance the purchase of such equipment 
in addition  the company previously committed to purchase or lease from ge open mri systems 
as of june   the company had not taken delivery of two such mri systems  which are included in the commitments discussed above 
the company may purchase  lease or upgrade other mri systems as opportunities arise to place new equipment into service when new contract services agreements are signed  existing agreements are renewed  acquisitions are completed  or new imaging centers are developed in accordance with the company s business strategy 
effective december   the company purchased pieces of diagnostic imaging equipment from ge by converting operating leases to capital leases 
the capital leases bear interest at per annum  have to month terms and contain a buyout at the end of each lease 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
for the seven months ended june   equipment lease expense was reduced by approximately million  and depreciation and interest combined was increased by approximately the same amount 
the company believes  on an annualized basis  equipment lease expense will be reduced by approximately million  and depreciation and interest will be increased by approximately the same amount 
the company also purchased four pieces of diagnostic imaging equipment which were also financed through capital leases with ge 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the company believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  its cash from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under the bank financing  will be sufficient through june  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on its debt  including payments due on the notes and obligations under the bank financing 
in addition  the company continually evaluates potential acquisitions and expects to fund such acquisitions from its available sources of liquidity  as discussed above 
the company s acquisition strategy may require sources of capital in addition to that currently available to the company 
the company expects  subject to market conditions  to obtain additional acquisition financing in the third quarter of fiscal no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any such necessary additional funds on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
results of operations years ended june  and revenues revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions and opened fixed facilities discussed above approximately million and an increase in contract services and patient services revenues approximately million at existing facilities  offset by a decrease in other revenues approximately million  primarily due to a one time settlement payment in connection with an earn out from the sale of the company s lithotripsy partnerships which was recorded in fiscal approximately million 
contract services revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions discussed above approximately million and an increase in the company s existing business approximately million 
the increase in existing business was due to i the addition of six mobile facilities and ii higher utilization approximately at the company s existing mobile customer base  offset by a decline in reimbursement from customers  primarily hospitals approximately 
contract services revenues  primarily earned by its mobile facilities  represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended june  each year approximately one quarter to one third of the contract services agreements are subject to renewal 
it is expected that some high volume customer accounts will elect not to renew their agreements and instead will purchase or lease their own diagnostic imaging equipment and some customers may choose an alternative services provider 
in the past where agreements have not been renewed  the company has been able to obtain replacement customer accounts 
while some replacement accounts have initially been smaller than the lost accounts  such replacement accounts revenues have generally increased over the term of the agreement 
the non renewal of a single customer agreement would not have a material impact on the company s contract services revenues  however  non renewal of several agreements could have a material impact on contract services revenues 
in addition  the company s contract services revenues with regard to its mobile facilities in certain markets depend in part on some customer accounts with high volume 
if the future reimbursement levels of such customers were to decline or cease or if such customers were to become financially insolvent and if such agreements were not replaced with new accounts or with the expansion of services on existing accounts  the company s contract services revenues would be adversely affected 
as a result of the implementation of the new opps for outpatient services  the company s contract services revenues could be adversely affected 
see reimbursement of health care costs and customers and fees 
patient services revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions and opened fixed facilities discussed above approximately million and an increase in revenues at existing facilities approximately million  offset by reduced revenues from the closure of the open mri fixed facility discussed above approximately million 
the increase at existing facilities was due to higher utilization approximately  partially offset by a decline in reimbursement from third party payors approximately 
management believes that any future increases in revenues at existing facilities can only be achieved by higher utilization and not by increases in procedure prices  however  slower start ups of new operations  excess capacity of diagnostic imaging equipment  competition  and the expansion of managed care may impact utilization and make it difficult for the company to achieve revenue increases in the future  absent the execution of provider agreements with managed care companies and other payors  and the execution of the company s business strategy  particularly acquisitions 
the company s operations are principally dependent on its ability either directly or indirectly through its hospital customers to attract referrals from physicians and other health care providers representing a variety of specialties 
the company s eligibility to provide service in response to a referral is often dependent on the existence of a contractual arrangement with the referred patient s insurance carrier primarily if the insurance is provided by a managed care organization 
managed care contracting has become very competitive and reimbursement schedules are at or below medicare reimbursement levels  and a significant decline in referrals could have a material impact on the company s revenues 
costs of operations costs of operations increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to additional costs related to the acquisitions and opened fixed facilities discussed above approximately million and at existing facilities approximately million  offset by reduced expenses for the closed open mri fixed facility discussed above approximately million 
costs of operations  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to approximately for the year ended june  from approximately for the year ended june  the percentage decrease is primarily due to reduced costs in equipment leases and depreciation  equipment maintenance and occupancy  offset by higher salary and benefit costs 
the company is continuing its effort to improve operating efficiencies through cost reduction initiatives 
the cost reduction initiatives are focused primarily on costs for diagnostic imaging equipment  including lease  depreciation and maintenance  occupancy  marketing and salary and benefits 
corporate operating expenses corporate operating expenses increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to additional information systems costs  offset by a decrease in travel  legal and consulting costs 
corporate operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased from approximately for the year ended june   to approximately for the year ended june  interest expense  net interest expense  net increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to additional debt related to i the acquisitions discussed above  ii the buy out of operating leases discussed above  iii higher interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and iv the company upgrading its existing diagnostic imaging equipment  offset by reduced interest as a result of amortization of long term debt 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased from a benefit of approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase is due to the company recording a reduction to the valuation allowance of approximately million to recognize anticipated benefits from the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards in the effective tax rate increased to approximately in from approximately in primarily as a result of the effects of benefits from the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
at the beginning of each fiscal year  the company estimates its effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the effective tax rate in light of certain factors  including actual operating income  acquisitions completed and new business development and the effects of benefits from the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
this review may result in an increase or decrease in the effective tax rate during the fiscal year 
income per common and converted preferred share on a diluted basis  net income per common and converted preferred share was for the year ended june   compared to net income per common and converted preferred share of for the year ended june  excluding the one time provision for reorganization and other costs and the benefit for income taxes  net income per common and converted preferred share on a diluted basis for the year ended june  would have been

years ended june  and revenues revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions and opened facilities discussed above approximately million and an increase in contract services  patient services and other revenues approximately million at existing facilities  partially offset by the termination of a fixed facility and a gamma knife center in approximately million 
contract services revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions discussed above approximately million and an increase at existing facilities approximately million 
the increase at existing facilities was due to higher utilization approximately offset by a decline in reimbursement from customers  primarily hospitals approximately 
patient services revenues increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions and opened facilities discussed above approximately million and an increase in revenues at existing facilities approximately million

costs of operations costs of operations increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to an increase in costs due to the acquisitions and opened facilities discussed above approximately million and an increase in costs at existing facilities approximately million  offset by the elimination of costs at the two terminated facilities discussed above approximately million 
costs of operations  as a percent of total revenues  decreased from approximately for the year ended june   to approximately for the year ended june  the percentage decrease was due primarily to reduced costs in service supplies  equipment maintenance  and equipment lease and depreciation costs as a result of the company negotiating favorable supply contracts and upgrading its existing diagnostic imaging equipment 
the decrease was offset by higher salaries and benefits and marketing costs 
provision for supplemental service fee termination as part of the recapitalization discussed above  the company issued to ge  shares of series c preferred stock to terminate ge s rights to receive supplemental service fee payments equal to of the company s pretax income 
the series c preferred stock was valued at million and  during the year ended june   the company recorded a one time provision of approximately million  net of amounts previously accrued  for the preferred stock issuance

the company has recorded a provision of approximately million for legal  accounting and consulting costs associated with certain potential acquisitions that the company determined were no longer consistent with its strategic objectives 
finally  the company reevaluated its information systems in light of organizational changes and developed a new strategic plan to modify and reimplement its proprietary radiology information system 
accordingly  the company recorded a provision with respect to related software and other capitalized costs of approximately million 
corporate operating expenses corporate operating expenses increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to i increased salaries  benefits and travel costs associated with the company s acquisition and development activities  ii increased occupancy and communication costs  and iii additional information systems costs  offset by reduced legal costs 
corporate operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased from approximately for the year ended june   to approximately for the year ended june  interest expense  net interest expense  net increased approximately from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to additional debt related to i the issuance of notes discussed above  which increased the company s effective interest rate  ii the acquisitions discussed above  and iii the company upgrading its existing diagnostic imaging equipment  offset by reduced interest as a result of amortization of long term debt 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased from approximately million for the year ended june   to a benefit of approximately million for the year ended june  the decrease in provision was due to the company recording a reduction to the valuation allowance of approximately million to recognize anticipated benefits from the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards available for use in fiscal income per common and converted preferred share on a diluted basis  net income per common and converted preferred share was for the year ended june   compared to net income per common and converted preferred share of for the same period in excluding the one time provision for reorganization and other costs and the benefit for income taxes discussed above  net income per common and converted preferred share on a diluted basis for the year ended june  would have been

the decrease in net income per common and converted preferred share before such provisions and benefit was the result of i the additional shares outstanding as a result of the recapitalization discussed above  ii increased interest expense  and iii a decrease in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships as a result of the installation of new diagnostic imaging equipment  offset by increased income from company operations 
new pronouncements in fiscal  the company will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives  instruments and hedging activities  as deferred and amended by sfas no 
the company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
year issue impact of year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurred  computer programs  computers and embedded microprocessors controlling equipment with date sensitive systems might have recognized year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat year might have resulted in computer system failures or miscalculations of critical financial and operational information as well as failures of equipment controlling date sensitive microprocessors 
in addition  miscalculations or failures could have been caused by the fact that the year is a leap year 
state of readiness the company started to formulate a plan to address the year issue in late the company s primary focus was on its own internal information technology systems  including all types of systems in use by the company in its operations  marketing  finance and human resources departments  and to deal with the most critical systems first 
the company developed a year plan to address all of its year issues 
the company gave its executive vice president and chief information officer specific responsibility for managing its year plan and a year committee was established to assist in developing and implementing the year plan 
as of august   the company had not experienced and does not expect to experience any material disruptions to its operations due to year issues  however  no assurance can be given that the company has assessed  identified or corrected all year issues that may arise in the coming months 
the company completed  prior to december   assessment  renovation  testing and implementation of all of its internal information technology systems  embedded microprocessors in its other equipment  facilities and corporate and regional offices  and its diagnostic imaging equipment 
the company also completed  prior to december   its assessment of the potential year problems with the information systems of its payors  customers  business partners  landlords and vendors 
as part of the company s year plan  it requested readiness statements from any third parties whose non compliance could materially adversely affect the company 
as of august   the company had not experienced any year issues with its payors  customers  business partners  landlords  vendors and third parties 
prior cost estimates to address year issues the company originally estimated the cost of assessment  renovation  testing and implementation would range from approximately  to  primarily related to capital expenditures for the replacement of diagnostic imaging equipment 
as of august   the company had incurred less than  in costs relating to consultants  additional personnel  programming  new software and hardware  software upgrades  travel expenses and the replacement of a piece of non compliant diagnostic imaging equipment at a center approximately  which was scheduled for replacement in fiscal the company s costs may increase if additional year issues arise in the future 
risks to the company although the company has completed the implementation of its year plan and has not encountered any material year issues  there are risks if its efforts did not address all uncertainties or that all uncertainties have been properly identified 
a failure by the company in remedying a year issue  or its failure to be  or the failure of its payors  customers  business partners  landlords  vendors and other third parties to be  year compliant  could  in the worst case scenario  cause a business interruption which may materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations depending upon the extent and duration of the business interruption 
contingency plans the company implemented a contingency plan to address unavoided or unavoidable year risks with internal information technology systems and with customers  vendors and other third parties but no assurance can be given that such plan will address all risks that may actually arise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk exposure relates primarily to interest rates  where the company will periodically use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on long term debt under its bank financing 
the company does not engage in activities using complex or highly leveraged instruments 
at june   the company had long term debt of approximately million which has floating rate terms 
the company also had outstanding an interest rate swap  converting million of its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
since the majority of the company s debt has historically been fixed rate debt  the impact of the interest rate swap has not been material on the company s weighted average interest rate
