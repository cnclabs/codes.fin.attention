item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical and supplemental financial and operating data  our historical and supplemental financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview waste connections  inc is a regional  integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in secondary markets of the western us as of december   we served more than  commercial  industrial and residential customers in california  colorado  idaho  iowa  kansas  new mexico  minnesota  nebraska  oklahoma  oregon  south dakota  texas  utah  washington  and wyoming 
as of that date  we owned collection operations and operated or owned transfer stations  subtitle d landfills and recycling facilities 
we intend to pursue an acquisition based growth strategy  and we acquired businesses from our inception in september through december   with of these acquisitions occurring in the aggregate consideration for acquisitions occurring in  using the purchase method of accounting  was approximately million 
the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition  except for acquisitions accounted for under the poolings of interests method of accounting  which are included for all periods presented 
we anticipate that a substantial part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  as a consequence  additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
on january   we acquired murrey s disposal company  inc  american disposal company  inc  dm disposal co  inc 
and tacoma recycling company  inc  respectively collectively  the murrey companies  in a combination accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the murrey companies are washington corporations that provide solid waste collection  transportation and recycling services to more than  customers in the seattle tacoma  washington area 
the purchase price consisted of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the merger with the murrey companies  we incurred transaction related costs of approximately million  which were charged to operations 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of two washington corporations  management environmental national  inc  meni  and rh financial corporation rhfc 
meni and rhfc are the sole partners of two limited partnerships  one of which provides solid waste handling and transportation services in the city of vancouver and in clark county  washington  and the other of which owns and operates the finley buttes regional landfill in morrow county  oregon 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash 
on august   we acquired international environmental industries  inc ieii 
ieii provides solid waste collection  transportation and recycling services  owns and operates one landfill and operates three other landfills  all in the areas around el paso  texas and southern new mexico 
the total consideration was approximately million  consisting of million in cash and million of our common stock valued at per share  shares 
in  we acquired nine other businesses in combinations accounted for as poolings of interests 
the aggregate consideration paid consisted of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with these mergers  we incurred transaction related costs of million  which were charged to operations 
general our revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
a large part of our collection revenues come from providing commercial  industrial and residential services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements or franchise agreements with counties or municipal contracts 
county franchise agreements and municipal contracts generally last from one to ten years 
our existing franchise agreements and many of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from services provided under exclusive franchise agreements  long term municipal contracts and governmental certificates 
governmental certificates grant us perpetual and exclusive collection rights in the covered areas 
contracts with counties and municipalities and governmental certificates provide relatively consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
because we bill most residential customers on a periodic basis  subscription agreements provide a stable source of revenues 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities 
the table below shows for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided  prior to intercompany eliminations 
the data below have been restated to give effect to acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
data for does not include the results of predecessor operations 
year ended december  collection transfer and processing landfill recycling other we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at the transfer stations and the landfill facilities we own and operate 
most of our transfer and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices for our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a published price index that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from services provided under exclusive municipal contracts and franchise agreements 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   or costs of operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
as of december   we owned and or operated transfer stations  which reduce our costs by allowing us to use collection personnel and equipment more efficiently and by consolidating waste to gain more favorable disposal rates that may be available for larger quantities of waste 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation overhead costs associated with our marketing and sales force  professional services and community relations expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal and engineering expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that is not completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
as of december   we had  of capitalized expenditures relating to landfill development projects and approximately  in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entities  and is amortized on a straight line basis over the period of expected benefit of years 
accumulated amortization of goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
within the purchase price of an acquired company  we first assign value to the tangible assets  followed by intangible assets  including covenants not to compete and certain contracts and customer lists that are determinable both in terms of size and life 
we determine value of the other intangible assets by considering  among other things  the present value of the cash flows associated with those assets 
we continually evaluate the value and future benefits of our intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the recoverability from future operations using cash flows and income from operations of the related acquired businesses as measures 
under this approach  the carrying value would be reduced if it becomes probable that our best estimate for expected future cash flows of the related business would be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
as of december   there have been no adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles resulting from these evaluations 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
we accrue for estimated landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs at the landfills we own 
under applicable regulations  waste connections and madera county  as operator and owner  respectively  are jointly liable for closure and post closure liabilities with respect to the fairmead landfill 
we have not accrued for such liabilities because madera county  as required by state law  has established a special fund into which it deposits a portion of tipping fee surcharges to pay such liabilities 
consequently  we do not believe that we had any financial obligation for closure and post closure costs for the fairmead landfill as of december  we will have additional material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of the other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate and that we may own or operate in the future 
we accrue for those obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of such landfills

liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development and landfill closure activities in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  debt and equity financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
at inception  we sold  shares of common stock at per share to our founders and  shares of series a preferred stock at per share 
in may and june  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares in our initial public offering including exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option 
in february  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares in a secondary public offering including exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option and used the proceeds to pay down approximately million of our outstanding debt 
as of december   we had options and warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which bankboston  na acts as agent 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under our credit facility  and the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was approximately 
the credit facility allows us to issue up to million in stand by letters of credit 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount of total borrowings available under the credit facility 
as of december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit  of which million were issued under the credit facility 
virtually all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures in and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our discretion  either the bankboston base rate plus applicable margin  or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin 
the credit facility places certain business  financial and operating restrictions on waste connections relating to  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  acquisitions  asset sales  mergers  dividends  distributions and repurchases and redemption of capital stock 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring that specified financial ratios and balances be maintained 
as of december   we are in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facility also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
the credit facility is used for i acquisitions  ii capital expenditures  iii working capital  iv standby letters of credit  and v general corporate purposes 
for the year ended december   operations provided approximately million of net cash  most of which was provided by operating results for the period  adjusted for temporary differences in income taxes  non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and stock compensation 
this was offset by an approximately million increase in working capital net of acquisitions in for the year ended december   we used million for investing activities 
of this amount  we used approximately million to fund the cash portion of acquisitions and approximately million for capital expenditures related to the purchase of trucks  containers  information systems and landfill construction activities 
for the year ended december   financing activities provided net cash of million  which was provided by net borrowings under our credit facility and revenue bonds and million in proceeds from the sale of common stock in our secondary offering 
we made approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in in connection with our existing business 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation to date  inflation has not significantly affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation 
however  competitive pressures may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
seasonality based on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in november of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bankboston that effectively converts million of our floating rate debt into two year fixed rate debt with an interest rate of plus an applicable margin as of december  in december  we entered into an interest rate hedge the hedge agreement with bankboston  na under the hedge agreement  which is effective through december  the interest rate on million of our floating rate long term debt is effectively fixed with an interest rate of plus an applicable margin 
this rate remains at if libor is less than 
if libor exceeds  the interest rate under the hedge agreement will increase one basis point for every libor basis point above 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the remainder of the balance of our credit facility and the municipal bond obligations in the combined amount of approximately million associated with madera  columbia resource company and wasco
