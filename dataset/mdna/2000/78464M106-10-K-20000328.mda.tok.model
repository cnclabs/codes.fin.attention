for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  the company s principal business activities in these markets included developing and licensing audio and voice technologies to original equipment manufacturers oems and semiconductor manufacturers around the world  and through its subsidiary  valence technology inc and its foreign subsidiaries collectively  valence  designing and selling technology solutions through custom application specific integrated circuits asics to oems  and designing  distributing and manufacturing components  sub assemblies and finished goods for the oem and retail communities within the company s targeted markets 
the company was formed in by purchasing all rights and assets of various audio and speaker technologies from the hughes aircraft company 
the company successfully completed its initial public offering in august  raising approximately million 
from the company s inception in until february  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from audio technology licensing activities for the consumer electronics  computer and game markets 
the primary technologies that contributed to revenue were srs r sound retrieval system r srs  which produces a d sound enhanced stereo image from any mono or stereo source  and trusurround tm  a virtual audio technology which processes multi channel surround sound through any standard pair of stereo speakers 
on march   the company acquired of the outstanding stock of valence technology inc  a british virgin islands holding company with its principal business operations in hong kong and china 
this acquisition significantly expanded the company s business activities from the original licensing model to include the design  manufacture and marketing of chips  components and products 
valence and its subsidiaries operate offices that are located in hong kong and china 
in addition to the acquisition of valence  during the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  the company acquired two additional technologies 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain rights to voice intelligibility processor vip  a patented voice processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice  especially in high ambient noise environments and  in the following quarter  acquired certain rights to circle surround  a patented audio delivery system that allows multi channel surround sound to be encoded into a two channel stereo format and allows an encoded two channel audio source to be decoded into a multi channel surround format 
key business developments in fiscal in fiscal  the company re engineered its business model and operational structure 
valence  while continuing to expand its asics business  exited certain of the lower margin distribution product lines and directed more of its resources to develop and market solutions that integrate the srs technologies 
in addition  the company began to explore the feasibility of selling a minority interest in valence technology inc to the public by listing such shares on a foreign exchange 
this strategy materialized when valencetech limited  the ultimate successor corporation to valence technology inc  filed an application to list on the growth enterprise market of the hong kong stock exchange on march  the company anticipates retaining ownership of valence tech limited upon completion of an initial public offering in asia targeted for the second quarter of the fiscal year ended december  with respect to the licensing business  the company changed its focus from entering into technology licenses with pc chip manufacturers to developing a new business model which focuses on internet audio 
this new focus resulted in the company launching the wowthing product family and establishing a new delaware wholly owned subsidiary  srswowcast 
com  inc  to be the platform to launch this business 
in march  microsoft corporation microsoft and the company entered into a strategic alliance whereby microsoft and the company entered into a license agreement relating to the company s wow technology 
in addition  microsoft made an equity investment into the company and was granted a warrant to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock as well as a warrant to purchase shares of common stock in srswowcast

valence sells these custom designed chips to its contracted customers  outsourcing the manufacturing to a network of fabrication partners throughout asia pacific  including chartered semiconductor  samsung electronics co  ltd and tower semiconductor limited in israel 
as of december and  the backlog orders of asic design work to non affiliated parties was  and  respectively 
the company expects that all or substantially all of the current backlog orders for fiscal will be completed in fiscal valence s asic customers are industry leading consumer electronics  telecommunications  game and personal computer manufacturers in north america and europe  as well as in asia pacific 
due to nondisclosure agreements  specific current customers cannot be disclosed  but previous design projects have been performed for such international companies as creative technology limited  innovision research and technology limited  national semiconductor corporation  raytron inc  toshiba corporation  system lsi division and utron technology inc 
under many of the design contracts  valence negotiates to retain ownership of the specific designs 
these designs form a significant library of intellectual property that can be used in future projects 
in addition to performing contract design work  valence designs  produces and sells ics to oems of consumer electronics  games  telecommunication and personal computer equipment in asia pacific under the brand name asp microelectronics 
the general purpose integrated circuits offered include micro controllers  prom and roms for dvd players  set top box receivers and audio video equipment  ics for telecommunication and game equipment  small signal transistors and ics used mainly in the manufacture of consumer products such as television sets  radios  telephones  computer mother boards  add on boards and audio hi fi systems 
the products created are based upon management s analysis of trends in the market  knowledge gained from long standing relationships with customers and overall business experience 
many of these products are developed by capitalizing upon the valence s custom design libraries 
technologies and licensing the company s technology portfolio covers a wide range of audio  voice and speaker technologies 
the company licenses these technologies to product and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as develops and markets implementation options and finished goods that feature these proprietary and patented technologies 
the company s technology strategy continues to be the development  acquisition and license of audio and voice technologies to product and semiconductor manufacturers in the consumer electronics  computer  game and telecommunications markets around the world 
by providing a continuous stream of patented audio and voice technologies  enhancing relationships with existing licensees and attracting new licensees  the company believes that it will strengthen its market position as a world leader in audio and voice technology 
the company s technologies may be implemented in a variety of methods  including discrete analog components  chip modules  analog semiconductors  digital signal processors and software 
these various implementation options offer customers significant flexibility when incorporating the company s technologies into products 
the markets which the company s technologies address include a wide variety of audio and voice related consumer products such as tvs  computers  stereo receivers  vcrs  video games  musical instruments  cellular phones  cordless phones  public address equipment and car audio equipment 
the markets for these consumer electronics products are highly competitive and generally dominated by large manufacturers 
the company provides technology to these manufacturers who need to differentiate their products by continually adding new features and increasing product performance 
license agreements with product manufacturers have terms which typically range from one to ten years and require per unit royalty payments for all products implementing the company s technologies 
certain agreements provide for a fixed annual or quarterly royalty payment 
license agreements also specify the use of the company s trademarks and logos and provide for product review and approval by the company 
the agreements do not have volume requirements and may be terminated by the licensees or the company without substantial financial penalty 
the company has primarily followed a licensing model whereby licensees are free to choose a semiconductor solution from a number of choices and  regardless of the semiconductor selection  the licensee pays a royalty directly to the company after the licensee s product has been shipped 
however  this methodology is not well established in the computer multimedia industry or the chinese consumer electronics marketplace 
to address these market conditions  the company has implemented an alternate royalty collection method  whereby the royalty is bundled into the cost of the semiconductor product when it is sold to the product manufacturer 
this methodology simplifies the business process for the product manufacturer  the semiconductor manufacturer and the company 
under this model  the royalty is remitted directly to the company by the semiconductor manufacturer after the chip has been delivered to the product manufacturer 
portfolio of audio and voice technologies the portfolio of audio  voice and speaker technologies offered by the company includes srs r  trusurround tm  focus r  baser r  orb r  avt tm  vip tm  circle surround r  srs headphone tm  wow tm  trubass tm  wowvoice tm and nuvoice tm 
srs  focus and trusurround are currently the subject of numerous license agreements and are actively marketed by the company 
baser and orb are speaker technologies that were included in the original technology acquisition from hughes aircraft and have not been actively promoted 
vip and circle surround were acquired during the first and second quarters of fiscal  respectively  and did not contribute significantly to revenue in fiscal or srs headphone  wow  avt and trubass were developed internally and were introduced to the marketplace in fiscal and also did not contribute significantly to revenues in fiscal or licensing royalties associated with srs  trusurround  focus  and technology transfer fees for new technologies have accounted for virtually all of the company s licensing revenues to date 
srs d sound srs d sound is one of the world s leading d audio enhancement technologies 
the patented technology broadens any mono or stereo audio signal and creates a realistic d sound image from just two standard stereo speakers 
srs is based on the fundamentals of the human hearing system and recreates the multitude of spatial cues that are present in a live listening environment but are lost in recording and playback 
srs eliminates the sweet spot associated with traditional stereo  accordingly  it does not require the listener to be positioned in a specific location to experience the immersive d sound image 
the technology can also be encoded onto cds  cassettes or videotapes during the recording process and reproduced through a conventional stereo system  multimedia computer  radio and television broadcast  or the internet 
srs was originally developed by hughes aircraft  which spent significant resources to develop and patent srs and related audio technologies 
since acquiring the srs technology from hughes aircraft in june  the company has improved the performance of srs  reduced the cost for oems to implement the technology  secured licensing relationships with various semiconductor manufacturers who offer the technology in various analog and digital chip options  and introduced the technology to a wider variety of consumer applications 
to date  products have been shipped with srs technology from more than manufacturers including acer peripherals  ltd  daewoo telecom ltd  hitachi ltd  ibm  kawai musical instruments mfg

trusurround trusurround is a dolby certified virtual audio technology  which creates an immersive surround sound experience from just two standard speakers from a multi channel audio source  such as dolby digital or dolby pro logic 
it was originally designed to take advantage of the channel audio standard for dvd  dolby digital  without requiring the use of six speakers 
trusurround processes the six discrete channels of digital audio into just two channels  retaining all of the original audio information and giving the listener the perception that they are surrounded by additional phantom speakers 
trusurround has been successfully introduced to the consumer electronics marketplace and is featured in a wide variety of products  including televisions from sony corporation  and dvd players from pioneer electronic corporation and philips consumer electronics bv semiconductor companies who offer trusurround in analog or digital implementation options for various applications in consumer electronics currently include akm semiconductor  new japan radio co  ltd  stmicroelectronics  mitsubishi electric corporation and zoran corporation 
the company believes that the eventual worldwide use of the dvd format will offer further opportunities for revenue growth 
focus in many audio environments  speakers are not placed directly in front of a listener making it difficult to achieve a realistic sound experience from speakers that are below the plane of the listener s ear 
the company developed focus as a technology solution for this problem 
originally designed for use in automobiles where front speakers are often placed under the dashboard or facing each other in the door panels  the patented focus technology electronically repositions the sound image to create the appropriate perception of image height 
in addition to automobiles  focus is ideally suited for any product application where speakers cannot be placed in optimal locations for either space or aesthetic reasons  such as big screen tvs  home in wall speakers and commercial applications such as drive through restaurant communications 
the first analog and digital chip options of focus became available for sampling to oems from mitsubishi electric corporation  new japan radio co  ltd 
and stmicroelectronics during the last half of fiscal focus has been successfully incorporated into consumer electronics products marketed by hitachi limited and marantz japan  inc speaker technologies the company holds patents for speaker technologies originally developed at hughes aircraft 
one such technology  orb  provides a unique approach to the physical design of speakers by incorporating a baffle that creates a degrees dispersion of sound 
another speaker technology  referred to as avt  projects the listening material so that the human ear can more easily identify the direction of ambient sounds 
a third speaker technology  baser  is a high efficiency design for a subwoofer product 
vip voice intelligibility processor technology vip is a patented audio processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice in a variety of challenging listening situations 
vip selectively processes only those spectral portions of the speech signal that the brain uses for cognition  without requiring increase in gain or volume 
srs inventor arnold klayman  who is now the principal audio scientist at the company  originally developed the vip technology at hughes aircraft 
during a divestiture in  hughes sold this non core business division to vip labs 
from until the acquisition by the company  vip labs further developed the technology as well as selectively marketed a stand alone signal processor for use in the professional sound reinforcement industry 
the company believes that the market opportunities for vip are significant and include cellular phones  wireless products  hearing aids  public address and emergency warning systems  talking toys  voice recognition products  voice over ip internet protocol and other internet applications 
the company directly offers both software and hardware implementation options for vip 
vip software is available as digital code that may be ported to dsp chips used by manufacturers of cellular phones  paging systems  digital televisions  sound reinforcement equipment and hearing aids 
vip is also available as software that may be executed on computer platforms to improve a variety of voice related processes

on january   the company announced that samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung has licensed vip for use in cellular and wireless products 
on february   the company announced the license of vip by lucent technologies 
vip has also been successfully implemented by samsung in a semiconductor chip targeted at the cellular and traditional telephone applications 
circle surround circle surround cs is a patented audio delivery system that allows multi channel surround sound to be encoded into a two channel stereo format and then allows an encoded two channel audio source or traditional audio source to be decoded into a multi channel surround format 
circle surround can be used in the recording process of music or movies and then implemented in a decoding playback device  such as a home audio receiver  dvd player or car audio product 
when used as an encoding decoding technology  cs encodes five discrete channels of sound through only two channels the same space required for stereo 
in the playback device  cs then takes the two channels of encoded material and decodes them back into the original five recorded channels for playback through a multi channel surround sound home theater or cinema system equipped with four or five speakers plus a subwoofer 
in addition  cs creates multiple channel surround sound from the wealth of legacy stereo and surround encoded material available on traditional music cds  vhs tapes  television or am fm broadcast 
circle surround technology is available for product manufacturers worldwide in the following formats analog ics through a relationship with analog devices  dsp implementations from cirrus logic and akm  digital software code from the company  and reference boards  sub systems and finished products for the home and car audio market from valence

wowthing 
com  the wow thing processor box which enhances the sound quality of music downloaded over the internet as well as audio performance of computer and home entertainment products and speakers 
other audio enhancement products for computer  home entertainment and game applications are in development for future introduction into the market place 
sales and marketing integrated circuits and licensing the company s sales and marketing strategies target the consumer electronics  computer  game and telecommunications industries 
to implement its strategy  the company has established a direct sales force and a worldwide network of independent sales agents and distributors 
the company has established distributors in korea  taiwan  japan  singapore  hong kong and china 
the company actively promotes the use of its trademarks and logos and directs customers to prominently display the appropriate srs technology logo on products  packaging and in advertising 
the company s corporate communications program includes press releases and sales informational mailings to its customers around the world 
the company also distributes audio cd cd roms that demonstrate srs technology and provides technical assistance and general consumer related information on the world wide web 
the company conducts tours and presentations for the press and other media outlets to promote the company s technologies and products 
the company regularly participates in tradeshows and conferences to increase awareness of its technologies and to market its technologies and products 
the company also works closely with its licensees and semiconductor partners to actively explore other opportunities to utilize the company s technologies in new products and or markets 
product and component sales the consumer electronics market in china is an important market for the company 
one way the company participates in this market is through the design and distribution of components and assembly kits to dvd and vcd manufacturers 
dvd and vcd players  which allow the playing of digital video on a compact disc format  are well suited for a broad range of applications  including music  video  education  training  movies and karaoke 
in a few short years  dvd and vcd have become and will continue to be the standard video format and have received mass market adoption in china 
through its distribution agreements and close relationships with leading digital video chip suppliers in china  such as national semiconductor and philips hong kong ltd  the company designs  develops and markets complete dvd and vcd players  as well as assembly kits and reference boards  at very competitive prices 
during fiscal  through a network of manufacturing partners in china  the company also produced and began offering home entertainment products under the brand name valence 
the consumer electronics market in china is highly competitive with many leading companies marketing to consumers in the larger cities in china  therefore  the company focuses its sales efforts on secondary markets 
the company has established a network of eight to ten regional distributors in various cities in china  who then sell the valence branded products to smaller distributors  dealers and retail establishments 
in fiscal  the company focused on the design and development of product and technology solutions either on a customer s request or under its own marketing and r d initiatives 
product and technology solutions developed and sold were for applications in dvd players  vcd players  digital power amplifiers  set top boxes  and surround sound decoders 
the technology solutions can be readily incorporated into end products  thus enabling a company s customer to shorten its time to market by reducing its own design and development cycle time 
research and development the company has spent approximately  and of total operating expenses on research and development in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage calculation for excludes expense related to acquired in process research and development 
the company s research and development group includes software  hardware and application engineers who focus on developing intellectual property  technology solutions and consumer products 
seven engineers are based in the us with the remainder based in hong kong and china 
the us based engineering group is focused upon developing new audio and voice technologies  improving the performance of existing technologies and reducing the implementation cost of the company s technologies 
these engineers also are focused on assisting customers to implement the company s technologies and supporting the company s sales and marketing efforts on a worldwide basis 
through valence  the company operates one of the largest independent ic design houses in hong kong  whose activities are primarily engaged in working on custom design asic projects for clients in the consumer electronics  game and telecommunications industries 
these clients range from local producers to large  multi national manufacturers around the world 
in  asp microelectronics  one of valence s subsidiaries  was awarded the hong kong industry award s hkitcc technological achievement award 
in  vsd electronics ltd  another valence subsidiary  was awarded the hong kong industry award s hkitcc certificate of merit in technology achievement 
the market for the company s technologies and products is subject to rapid and significant changes and frequent new technology and product introductions 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to continue to enhance its existing technologies and to introduce or acquire new technologies on a competitive basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to successfully enhance existing technologies and products or introduce or acquire new technologies and products 
competition the company competes in each of its business segments with a number of companies which produce a variety of audio and voice enhancement technologies  processes and products 
these technologies  processes and products include thx r  a certification program that indicates if a movie theater or particular piece of audio equipment meets certain specifications  dolby r a type  b type and c type noise reduction  dolby sr r  which provides noise reduction and encodes analog sound using four sound channels  prologic tm  a surround sound system incorporating an active center channel  dolbysrd r  which encodes a six channel digital sound track on a movie print  dts r  which uses cds to reproduce six channels of digital sound synchronized with a movie print  and sdds r  which encodes six or eight channels of digital sound on both sides of a movie print 
because srs works with any existing recorded material whether mono  stereo  surround sound or other encoding process  srs can be used either as an alternative or as a complement and enhancement to almost any competing audio technology 
as a multi channel encode decode technology  circle surround competes more directly with the various surround sound technologies listed above 
the company also directly competes in the field of d audio enhancement with other d audio providers  including aureal  qsound labs  inc  sensaura and spatializer 
the company is not aware of any direct competing technologies to its voice intelligibility technology  vip 
the company believes that trubass might directly compete with several technologies  including maxxbass from waves  ltd 
and non proprietary bass enhancement circuits  such as bass boost  that are included on a variety of electronics products  including televisions  audio systems and speaker products 
in addition  the company s technologies may  in the future  compete with audio technologies developed by other companies  some of whom may be current licensees of the company 
certain of these companies referenced above have  or may have  substantially greater resources than the company to devote to further technologies and new product developments 
the company believes that it will compete based primarily on the quality and performance of its proprietary technologies  brand name awareness  the ease and cost of implementing its technologies  the ability to meet oems needs to differentiate their products  and the strength of its licensee relationships 
there can be no assurance that based on these factors the company will continue to be competitive with existing or future products or technologies of its competitors 
the company s competitors to its semiconductor ic business are primarily fabless semiconductor design houses and manufacturers located in taiwan  japan and korea 
given that taiwan is focusing on the development of the personal computer industry  most of the fabless semiconductor design houses in taiwan also focus on the design of dynamic random access memory  static random access memory and semiconductors for personal computer applications 
these fabless semiconductor design houses focus less on semiconductors for consumer electronics such as home audio and video products  communications equipment and electronic games players 
although the chinese semiconductor industry is dominated by several major chip suppliers  such as motorola  national semiconductor and texas instruments  within every major market there is need for local  niche participants  such as the company 
generally speaking  established semiconductor companies do not offer semiconductor design services to manufacturers and will only do so if the volume of semiconductors required by such manufacturers is of a very large quantity 
instead  they supply standard semiconductors to such manufacturers 
these standard semiconductors may not be the most suitable components for the manufacturers as they may require additional semiconductor components to perform the designed functions required in their products 
in such cases  these semiconductors will be bulkier  heavier and more expensive compared to using just one custom designed system on chip asic 
the company s asic team is more flexible in its strategy of designing new products  as well as more responsive and flexible in the service provided to clients 
with fourteen years of background in the chinese semiconductor market  the company s personnel has expertise in local business practices and a strong franchise of relationships with clients that the company believes gives it a competitive advantage over newcomers to the industry or the large multi national firms 
the company s through valence and its subsidiaries chip and component distribution contracts to distribute products for third party semiconductor manufacturers in the domestic chinese market are not exclusive  and the company competes with other distributors  such as arrow electronics  future electronics and avnet inc in addition  the semiconductor companies who manufacture the components and chips also sell directly to manufacturers within china 
through a network of manufacturing partners in china  the company during fiscal produced and offered home entertainment products for wholesale and distribution through retailers  under the brand name valence 
in fiscal  the company focused on the development and marketing of product and technology solutions targeted at applications in dvd players  vcd players  digital power amplifiers  set top boxes  and surround sound decoders 
the technology solutions can be readily incorporated into end products  thus enabling a company s customer to shorten its time to market by reducing its own design and development cycle time 
although the overall consumer electronics market in china is vast  it is highly competitive with many large manufacturers competing in the retail channel with established brand names 
the markets in which the company sells its products are subject to extreme price competition  thus the company expects to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of its products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset declines in the selling prices of its products  the company must continue to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts and other savings negotiated with its manufacturing subcontractors 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facilities with respect to asics or product or component sales  it may not be able to reduce its costs as rapidly as its competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
the failure of the company to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or higher gross margin new products  or to successfully manage its manufacturing subcontractor relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margins 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information the company operates in industries where innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of its resulting intellectual property rights are important for success 
the company relies on a variety of intellectual property protections for its products and services  including patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual obligations  and pursues a policy of enforcing such rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s intellectual property rights will be adequate to ensure the company s competitive position  or that competitors will not be able to produce a non infringing competitive product or service 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  or that if required to obtain any third party licenses as a result of an infringement dispute the company will be able to obtain such licenses 
although the company believes that its patents and trademarks are important to each of its business segments  such patents and trademarks are especially important to the chip and licensing business segment 
srs is the subject of five us patents containing a combined total of claims 
the expiration dates for these us patents are may   june   september   october  and april   respectively 
in addition  the company has issued foreign patents relating to srs and over additional foreign patents pending 
the expiration dates for these foreign patents varies depending on the particular patent and the particular country  but in most cases the duration of such foreign patents will extend into the year the company also owns four us patents for speaker technologies and has issued foreign patents for these technologies with several other foreign patents pending 
the expiration dates for these us patents are april   june   january  and october   respectively 
the expiration dates for these foreign patents varies depending on the particular patent and the particular country  but in most cases the duration of such foreign patents will extend into the year the company owns us patents for vip  focus  trusurround and circle surround with numerous foreign patents pending for each of these technologies 
in addition  the company has multiple new audio technology patents pending in the us and worldwide for improvements to srs and for its focus  trusurround and trubass technologies

the in process research and development expenses arose from new product projects that were under development at the date of the acquisition and expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upon the discounted expected future net cash flows of the products over the products expected lives  reflecting the estimated stages of completion of the projects and the estimated costs to complete the projects 
new product development projects underway at valence at the time of the valence acquisition included  among others  asics for consumer electronics  computing and voice and audio applications  home entertainment systems  digital multimedia players and digital power amplifiers

the licensing revenue decrease was offset by the custom asic chip design and chip sales of  related to valence s activities

valence also exited from certain of the lower margin distribution business which enabled it to carry less inventories to support customer demands 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily due to the collection of other receivables of  during fiscal accounts payable decreased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to the decrease in component sales volume at valence  which resulted in reduced inventory levels and purchasing activity  as well as payment of various other trade payables by valence

year issue update the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues such as leap year related problems may occur with billing  payroll  or financial closings at month  quarterly  or year end 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively affected if its customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers and suppliers 
the company expended less than  on year readiness efforts from fiscal to fiscal these efforts included replacing some outdated  noncompliant hardware and noncompliant software as well as identifying and remediating year problems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company does not believe that its adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results quarterly fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the extent to which the company s licensees incorporate the company s technologies into their products  the timing of orders from  and the shipments  to major customers  the timing of new product introductions by the company  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s technologies  the rate that the company s semiconductor licensees manufacture and distribute chips to product manufacturers  and fluctuations in general economic conditions  particularly those affecting the consumer electronics market 
due to the company s dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact the company s revenues and net income 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company believes that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season as well as the chinese new year within the asia region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters  respectively 
valence s business the company derived a significant amount of its revenue from valence s asic and component distribution business 
valence s engineering team focuses on the design of custom asic to meet specific customers requirements and outsources the production of the design to mask houses  foundries and packaging houses located primarily in asia 
the operations of valence could be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products distributed and the mix of distribution channels employed  the emergence of a new industry standards  product obsolescence and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers 
the asic business revenue is concentrated in a limited number of customers in the areas of consumer electronics  communications products  computers and computer peripherals 
as such  the loss of any such customers or any bad debt arising from them may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
beginning in fiscal  valence began to exit from certain lower margin product offerings in the distribution side of the business and has begun developing and distributing products that are related to or incorporate the company s proprietary technologies 
as a result  the immediate loss in revenue of the low margin distribution business will not be entirely offset by the new proprietary technology based products  which will take time to develop and be introduced into the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to quickly introduce new products to offset the loss in revenue or that the new products developed will receive a favorable market acceptance 
the public offering of common shares of valencetech limited in hong kong is intended to bring new capital to grow valence s core business while  at the same time  adding significant value to the company s shareholders 
although the company expects that such offering will be completed during the second quarter of fiscal  there is no assurance that the offering will be completed during that time period or at all 
changes in the economic environment of hong kong and or the prc may adversely affect the offering or  if the offering is completed  may adversely affect the market price of the common shares 
the acquisition of valence has added significant diversity to the company s overall business structure and the company s opportunities 
the company recognizes that in the presence of such corporate diversity  and in particular with regard to the semiconductor industry  there will always exist a potential for a conflict among sales channels between the company and certain of the company s technology licensees 
although the operations of the company s licensing business and those of valence are generally complementary  there can be no assurances that sales channel conflicts will not arise 
if such potential conflicts do materialize  the company may or may not be able to mitigate the effect of such perceived conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop an effective distribution channel and build a brand recognition as a product manufacturer 
and as the business increases  it is anticipated that significant capital will be required to finance product inventory and account receivables 
as a result  the company is subject to risks of product obsolescence  bad debt and insufficient finance to grow the business 
the company also recognizes that as new consumer audio products are developed and marketed by the company  there will always exist a potential for a conflict and competition between the company and certain of the company s technology licensees 
although the intended products of the company and those of its licenses do not generally overlap  there can be no assurances that the company s products will not compete with those of their licensees 
if such conflicts do materialize  it is uncertain whether the company will be able to mitigate the effect of such conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations

there can be no assurance that such growth will not continue to decrease or that any slow down will not have a negative effect on the company s business  including valence 
the prc economy is also experiencing deflation which may continue in the future 
the current economic situation may adversely affect the company s profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation

the company can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
continued recession in hong kong  deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect the company s business 
currency risk stability of asian markets the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
to date  all of the company s licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
it is the company s expectation that licensing revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
because valence and its subsidiaries business is primarily focused in asia and because of the company s anticipated expansion of its business in china and other parts of asia  the company s consolidated operations and financial results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
in addition  the company s valuation of assets recorded as a result of the valence acquisition may also be adversely impacted by the currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar

competitive pressures the company s existing and potential competitors include both large and emerging domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
the company s present or future competitors may be able to develop products and technologies comparable or superior to those offered by the company  and to adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving market needs 
the company believes that the competitive factors affecting the market for the company s products and technologies include product performance  price and quality  product functionality and features  the ease of integration  and implementation of the products and technologies with other hardware and software components in the oem s products 
in addition  the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in its respective markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
importance of intellectual property the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company has filed several us and foreign patent applications and to date has a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of its technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other property rights

the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel 
the company anticipates that any future growth will require it to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain and recruit necessary personnel to operate its business and support future growth 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully also will require the company to continue to expand and improve its administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in the company s operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  strategic alliances between the company and third parties  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which the company does business  or relating to the company specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
acquisitions from time to time  the company expects to make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that are complementary to its business strategy 
such future acquisitions would expose the company to risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among others  difficulty of assimilating the operations  information systems and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  and the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through successful incorporation of the acquired technologies  employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that any potential acquisition will be consummated or  if consummated  that it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

there can be no assurance that the acquired in process research and development projects associated with the acquisitions of valence and vip will be successfully completed and commercially introduced

foreign currency the company has subsidiary operations in hong kong and china  and accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for its subsidiaries 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were nil in fiscal and due to the fact that the value of the hong kong dollar is currently pegged to the us dollar  and the exchange rate remained constant throughout such fiscal years 
under the current circumstances  the company believes that the foreign currency market risk is not material 
the company actively monitors its foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intends to implement strategies to reduce its risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful
