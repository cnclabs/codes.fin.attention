the company believes that operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation is viewed as a relevant supplemental measure of performance in the cellular telephone industry 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating results for the year ended december  reflect the continued improvement in operating cash flow  subscriber growth and the related increase in penetration  maintenance of a strong average revenue per subscriber arpu and strong cost controls which translate to a low average cost per subscriber 
revenue 
service revenues totaled approximately million for the current year compared to approximately million for or an increase of 
the increase is a result of greater local cellular revenue due to an increase in the average number of cellular subscribers and increased air time revenue as a result of the increase from 
billion minutes of use for minutes per average subscriber to billion minutes of use in minutes per average subscriber 
despite the increasing competition for additional cellular subscribers  the company was able to maintain its local revenue per cellular subscriber which in fact rose from in to in in addition  the company s outcollect roaming revenue  which is revenue that the company derives from other cellular companies subscribers roaming in our markets  increased as a result of an increase in usage from million minutes in to million minutes in in the future  the company may realize a decrease in the rate of growth from roaming revenue as a result of new roaming rates negotiated with some of the company s roaming partners 
equipment revenue amounted to million for the current year compared to million in the significant increase in equipment revenue of is a combination of a greater portion of the cost being recovered from subscribers  an increase in the average revenue per gross addition from to  and a greater emphasis on accessory sales to new subscribers 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in after excluding non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization  operating expenses amount to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for total operating costs per cellular subscriber excluding pcc overhead and all non cash charges amounted to in and in engineering  technical and other direct expenses increased from million in to million in there are three major components in this category 
the net cost of incollect  which represents the difference between the amount paid to other cellular carriers for the company s subscribers roaming in other carriers markets and the amount charged to these subscribers  variable network costs such as inter trunk  long distance and directory assistance costs  and engineering costs which consist principally of salaries and fixed span line costs and tower rentals 
as a result of negotiations with other cellular carriers  the company was able to reduce the amount it reimburses those carriers for incollect roaming resulting in a recovery of of cost for compared to a recovery for or a decrease of million of net expense 
offsetting these savings were increases in long distance  directory assistance and interconnect costs related to the increased utilization of the system which is evidenced by a increase in minutes of use 
decreases in engineering salaries and related expenses were offset by increases in fixed span line costs and additional cell site rents as the company continued to build out its system by adding new cell sites and increasing the number of radios in the existing cell sites 
the increase in gross subscriber additions combined with the increase in cellular phone upgrades as well as the higher cost of digital phones  resulted in an increase of the cost of equipment from million in to million in in addition  increases in the sale of accessories contributed to the increase in equipment cost 
the company recovered of the cost of equipment in compared to a recovery of in selling  general and administrative sg a increased to million for the current year compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sg a decreased from of total revenue in to in sales and marketing costs which include installation costs included as engineering in  salaries  commissions and advertising  amount to million for both and decreases in salaries and related benefits were offset by increases in commissions and advertising expenditures 
the cost to add a gross cellular subscriber  which consists of the net loss on equipment sales and sales and marketing expenditures  decreased from in to in customer service costs  which consist principally of billing costs and payroll and related benefits  increased to million in from million in increases in personnel and billing costs are a direct function of the increases in the number of subscribers 
additional subscribers require an increase in the number of cellular bills mailed out  as well as an increase in the number of customer service representatives to handle the additional subscriber inquiries 
general and administrative expenses remained almost constant amounting to million in and million in significant savings in payroll and related benefits were offset by the increase in the provision for bad debts 
included in operating expenses for is a charge of million representing the non cash compensation charges related to the conversion by an officer of the corporation of the company s preferred stock into common stock see notes to consolidated financial statements 
such charges are being expensed over the vesting period of the common stock 
the conversions occurred during and had there been a full year of expense  the total non cash compensation would have amounted to million for depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in decreases in the amortization of intangibles related to the finalization in of the value of the cellular licenses from the acquisition  were more than offset by increases in depreciation expense due to fixed asset additions in operating income improved significantly from million achieved in to million in earnings before non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million for or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the improvement is a function of management s ability to control costs while still maintaining significant subscriber growth and maintaining and growing arpu in the face of a declining trend in the cellular industry 
the increase in ebitda from to represents a growth of 
net interest expense  other income  income taxes  extraordinary item and net income 
net interest expense decreased to in from million in during  long term debt consisted of at various times the revolving loan and credit facility at variable interest rates  million of senior secured discount notes  million of senior subordinated notes  million of senior secured notes and million of senior exchangeable payable in kind notes 
in june  the company allowed the conversion of the million payable in kind notes and therefore incurred only six months of non cash interest expense 
the million notes and the million notes were outstanding for the full year 
the effect of the different borrowings resulted in interest savings of  the additional cash on hand as a result of the new borrowings in resulted in additional interest income of million 
the current debt outstanding pays cash interest and would result in interest expense of million for a full year 
other income for resulted largely from the gain from the sale of pricellular corporation warrants and stock 
other income for resulted primarily from the liquidation of a long standing investment by the company million and from net gains realized in capital markets by the parent company 
the income tax provision for of million compared to the income tax benefit of million in is a result of taxable income in at an effective rate of approximately compared to a taxable loss at a benefit of approximately 
the net income of million for compared to a net loss of million for is a function of the items discussed above 
in addition  includes million net of tax benefit of deferred finance charges written off  the premium associated with the early extinguishment of debt and interest paid for the early liquidation of the interest rate swap contracts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the results of operations for the company for the year ended december  are not comparable to the results of the prior year principally due to the fact that includes a full year of operations for the acquisition  a full year of interest to fund the acquisition and certain extraordinary items net of tax benefits  resulting from the refinancing in the current year 
included in other income for the current year are the gains realized from the sale of common stock and warrants of pricellular corporation the total of which amounted to million

price communications wireless and predecessor  year ended december  compared to december  revenue 
service revenues totaled million during  an increase of from million in the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the average number of subscribers to  for versus  in after adjusting for the sale of the fort myers and ga markets 
substantially offsetting this increase is the loss of service revenue of the cellular telephone systems resulting from the sale of fort myers and ga  which approximated million 
the increase in subscribers is the result of internal growth  which the company attributes primarily to its strong sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to the subscriber base growth  service revenues also increased because of a significant increase in the minutes of use for the company s subscribers 
average monthly revenue per subscriber decreased to during from in  which excluded incollect revenue 
this decrease is due to a common trend in the cellular telephone industry  where on average  new customers use less airtime than existing subscribers 
therefore  service revenues generally do not increase proportionately with the increase in subscribers 
in addition  the decline reflects more competitive rate plans introduced into the company s markets 
the decrease  however  is below the industry average 
equipment sales and installation revenue  which consists primarily of cellular subscriber equipment sales  increased to million during from million in as a percentage of total cellular revenue  equipment sales and installation revenue increased to of service revenue from for  reflecting the increased recurring revenue base as well as the ability to obtain increased prices for cellular equipment sold to customers

selling  general and administrative expenses increased a modest to million in from million in these expenses are comprised of i sales and marketing costs  ii customer service costs and iii general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing costs increased to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to an increase in gross subscriber activations excluding prepaids and the costs to acquire them and higher advertising costs in response to market competition 
as the level of penetration increases  the sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring additional subscribers increases 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing costs increased to during compared to in the company s cost to add a net subscriber  including loss on telephone sales  decreased to for from for sales and marketing expenses associated with the fort myers and ga markets approximated million 
customer service costs increased to million for from million in as a percentage of revenue  customer service costs amounted to for and for the increase in actual dollars was due primarily to an increase in license and maintenance costs for the company s billing systems due to the increase in the number of subscribers that receive invoices on a monthly basis  and was partially offset by the expenses incurred for the fort myers and ga markets which approximated million in general and administrative expenditures decreased to million during from million in general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in payroll and its related fringe benefits were the largest line items that reflected a decrease 
general and administrative expenses attributable to the cellular telephone systems sold in fort myers and ga amounted to million in as the company continues to add more subscribers  and generates associated revenue  general and administrative expenses should continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that this forward looking statement will not differ materially from actual results due to unforeseen general and administrative expenses and other factors

the income tax benefit for amounted to million representing the reduction of the accrued tax liability associated with the sale of the ft 
myers and ga properties  which was established as the result of purchase accounting 
the income tax benefit for was approximately million based on the loss for the year 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increased net loss is a result of the additional interest expense  increased depreciation and amortization expense and million of extraordinary items net of tax benefit
