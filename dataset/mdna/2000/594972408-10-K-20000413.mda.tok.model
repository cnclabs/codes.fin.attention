in july  we launched a new business unit called strategy 
com 
strategy 
com is our personal intelligence network  a new form of media that brings speed to transactions by actively delivering highly personalized  relevant and timely information to individuals through a wide variety of delivery methods  including e mail  telephone and wireless devices 
the strategy 
com network leverages the microstrategy software platform and is organized around a suite of information channels 
the network currently operates a finance channel and plans to launch additional channels on subjects such as weather  news  politics  arts  traffic  travel and entertainment 
strategy 
com syndicates its channels through other companies that serve as network affiliates and network associates  which we refer to collectively as affiliates 
affiliates offer the strategy 
com channels and services on a co branded basis directly to their customers and in turn share with strategy 
com a percentage of revenues they generate 
strategy 
com also provides application maintenance  development  customer billing  hosting and support services for these channels  enabling affiliates to focus on their core businesses 
strategy 
com has established more than network affiliate agreements with leading internet companies  communications carriers  media companies and financial institutions and now has approximately  subscribers for its strategy 
com finance channel 
strategy 
com has recognized no revenue as of december  since  we have significantly increased our sales and marketing  service and support  research and development and general and administrative staff 
although our revenues have significantly increased over the last three years  we experienced fluctuating operating margins during  and primarily as a result of increases in staff levels 
we expect to continue to increase staffing levels and incur additional associated costs in future periods 
in addition  we intend to substantially increase our investment in strategy 
com 
we therefore expect operating losses to significantly increase in our revenues historically have been derived from two principal sources  fees for product licenses and fees for maintenance  technical support  education and consulting services  which we refer to collectively as product support and other services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as applicable 
product license revenues are generally recognized upon the execution of a contract and shipment of the related software product if no significant obligations remain outstanding on our part and the resulting receivable is deemed collectible by management 
technical support revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with initial product license sales and subsequent renewals 
fees for our technical support services are displayed as deferred revenue when paid by the customer and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support agreement  which is typically one year 
we also record as deferred revenue the fair value of implicit maintenance arrangements when resellers or other customers that sell our software to end users offer these end users the right to receive the then current version of our software at the time of resale 
certain of these agreements extend over several years 
fees for our education and consulting services are typically recognized at the time the services are performed 
revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  technical support  installation or education 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence based on historical sales of the individual element by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
customers at times require consulting and implementation services which include evaluating their business needs  identifying resources necessary to meet their needs and installing the solution to fulfill their needs 
when the software license arrangement requires the company to provide significant consulting services to produce  customize or modify software or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and product support and other services revenue are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop the company recognizes revenue from these arrangements using the percentage of completion method and  therefore  both product license and product support and other services revenue are recognized as work progresses 
if the software license arrangement obligates the company to the delivery of unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
beginning initially in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  we began to sell our products and services to customers for large scale e commerce applications 
in contrast to earlier periods in which our typical customer transaction involved a stand alone software license and maintenance  these transactions typically involve multiple software products and services for use by very large numbers of end users across web  wireless and voice communications channels  and often incorporate elements from our strategy 
com network 
these multiple element transactions also often include significant implementation and other consulting work and may also include our providing the customer with hosting services  in which we manage the operation of hosting the customer s specific e commerce application 
customers often use our products and services in a variety of ways  including internal use  integration with their own products for resale to end users and creation of e commerce applications 
these arrangements typically lead to our recording revenue from multiple sources  including product license fees  product support fees and royalties based on advertising  e commerce transactions or the resale of solutions that incorporate our software platform 
these large  multiple element transactions typically involve more complex licensing and product support arrangements than the software licensing and product support arrangements that comprised the bulk of our revenues in earlier periods 
based on the revenue recognition criteria established in sop and sop  revenue from many of these large  multiple element contracts is not recognizable upon full execution and delivery of the software product as in the past  but instead is initially recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt of cash  with product revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs or ratably over the entire term of the contract 
as a result of the size and complexity of these transactions  our results for any quarter may depend significantly on the types of customer transactions that we enter into during the quarter and on the mix of product licenses  support agreements  implementation work and other specific terms of each transaction  each of which may have a significant effect on the manner in which we recognize revenue from the transaction 
the sales cycle for our products may span nine months or more 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of a quarter 
even minor delays in booking orders may have a significant adverse impact on revenues for a particular quarter 
to the extent that delays are incurred in connection with orders of significant size  the impact will be correspondingly greater 
product license revenues in any quarter can be dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
we license our software through our direct sales force and increasingly through  or in conjunction with  value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we intend to increase the level of indirect sales activities 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts to continue to expand indirect sales will be successful 
we also intend to continue to expand our international operations and have committed  and continue to commit  significant management time and financial resources to developing direct and indirect international sales and support channels

comparison of  and revenues 
total revenues consist of revenues derived from sales of product licenses and product support and other services  including technical support  education and consulting services 
total revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in  resulting in a revenue growth rate of in  in and in there can be no assurance that total revenues will continue to increase at the rates experienced in prior periods 
the slower growth rates in and were attributed to our new evolving business model 
we entered into several new multiple element transactions for large scale e commerce applications and complex strategy 
com deployments during and based on the revenue recognition criteria established in sop and sop  revenue from many of these large  multiple element arrangements is recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt of cash  with both product license revenues and product support and other services revenues recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs or ratably over the entire term of the contract or over the hosting period  as applicable 
in  we launched the strategy 
com finance channel and plan to launch additional information channels in the future 
we expect to begin earning subscription  advertising  transaction and other fees from our strategy 
com service by the end of product license revenues 
product license revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in  resulting in a growth rate of in  in and in the increase in product license revenues was due to continued demand for our core products  new product offerings supporting intelligent e business solutions and increasing market demand for intelligent e business solutions 
we are attracting new customers and our existing customer base is purchasing additional licenses and new products to support their e business solutions 
as we continue to pursue our new business model of larger scale  multiple element transactions  we expect product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate on a period to period basis  and may vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or continue to increase market acceptance for our family of products 
product support and other services revenues 
product support and other services revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in  resulting in a growth rate of in  in and in the increase in product support and other services revenues was primarily due to the increase in product licenses sold as well as an increase in large scale e commerce applications which require significant implementation and other consulting work 
an element of our sales and marketing strategy is to use third party implementation services to enable us to more rapidly penetrate our target market 
in addition  we plan to use our consultants more aggressively to help sell our products and services  assist with development of strategy 
com channels and other research and development projects 
to the extent that such efforts are successful  our product support and other services revenues could decline as a percentage of total revenues 
as a result of the above mentioned trends  we expect product support and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate on a period to period basis  and may vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
international revenues 
international revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in  resulting in a growth rate of in  in and in the increase in these revenues is due to the expansion of our international operations  new product offerings and growing international market acceptance of our software products 
we opened sales offices in brazil in  in canada and italy in and in austria  france  the netherlands  germany  united kingdom and spain prior to we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues and management expects to continue to commit significant time and financial resources to the maintenance and ongoing development of direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
we may not be able to maintain or continue to increase international market acceptance for our family of products 
costs and expenses cost of product license revenues 
cost of product license revenues consists primarily of the costs of product manuals  media  amortization of capitalized software expenses and royalties paid to third party software vendors 
cost of product license revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of product license revenues  however  cost of product license revenues decreased from in to in and to in the decrease in cost of product license revenues as a percentage of product license revenues was due to economies of scale realized by producing larger volumes of product materials and decreased materials costs due to an increase in the percentage of customers reproducing product documentation at their sites 
we anticipate that the cost of product license revenues will continue to increase as product license revenues increase  but decrease as a percentage of product license revenues 
however  in the event that we enter into any royalty arrangements with strategic partners in the future  cost of product license revenues as a percentage of total product license revenues may increase 
cost of product support and other services revenues 
cost of product support and other services revenues consists of the costs of providing technical support  education and consulting services to customers and partners 
cost of product support and other services revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of product support and other services revenues  cost of product support and other services revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of product support and other services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of personnel providing consulting  education and technical support to customers as a result of the increase in product licenses sold  new large scale e commerce applications and complex strategy 
com deployments 
despite the increase in personnel and other costs for  the total cost of product support revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues during compared to primarily due to the increase in technical support revenues which typically do not require proportionate increases in the costs required to perform associated technical support services 
this trend continued in  however  the improvements in margin due to increasing technical support revenues were offset by the increased use of third parties to perform consulting services 
we expect to continue to increase the number of customer education and implementation consultants and technical support personnel in the future 
to the extent that our product support and other services revenues do not increase at anticipated rates  the hiring of additional consultants and technical support personnel could increase the cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues 
in addition  to the extent that we cannot hire adequate numbers of support personnel to meet demand  we may need to rely more heavily on third parties to perform consulting services  further increasing cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  advertising  public relations programs and promotional events  such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in and increased to in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels in the sales force  increased commissions earned  increased promotional activities and advertising  increased marketing efforts for strategy 
com and general marketing efforts 
in addition  we began a national advertising campaign during the fourth quarter of  which we plan to continue in we have invested and will continue to substantially increase our investment in sales and marketing over the next twelve months in order to create better market awareness of the value added potential of our product suite and to seek to acquire market share 
in addition  we intend to invest heavily over the next twelve months to market strategy 
com 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of software engineering personnel  depreciation of equipment and other costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from in to in and to in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to hiring additional research and development personnel to continue development of strategy 
com channels  new products  product releases and e commerce technology 
we intend to substantially increase our investment over the next twelve months to develop sports  traffic and other channels as part of our suite of information channels of our strategy 
com network 
in addition  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue to invest in developing new products  applications and product enhancements for our existing platform business 
in  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer equipment to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we capitalized research and development costs associated with the version release of our software product line 
as a result  we capitalized approximately million of research and development costs during during and  no costs were capitalized as the establishment of technological feasibility and general release of such software had substantially coincided 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our finance  human resources  information systems  administrative and executive departments as well as outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expense were in  in and in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased staff levels and related costs associated with the growth of our business during these periods 
although we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future  such expenses are not expected to significantly vary as a percentage of total revenues in the future 
in process research and development 
in december  we purchased the intellectual property and other tangible and intangible assets  including the assembled workforce  relating to ncr s teracube project in exchange for  shares of class a common stock  valued at million  based on the price of our stock at the closing 
we will develop the teracube assets in concert with its existing proprietary technology to create a business intelligence platform for datawarehouses using ncr s teradata database 
our preliminary allocation of the million purchase price was million for in process research and development and million to tangible and intangible assets including core technology  computer equipment  assembled work force and agreements not to compete 
we believe the weighted average estimated useful life of such assets  based upon the final allocation  will be less than years and anticipate the final allocation will be completed during the first half of as a result  we will incur substantially incresased amortization expense in future periods relating to the amortization of these intangible assets 
we recorded  in related amortization expense related to the teracube project in in estimating the fair value of the in process research and development projects acquired  we considered  among other factors  the stage of development of the teracube research and development projects at the time of the acquisition and projected estimated cash flows from those projects when completed and the percentage of the final products cash flows that is attributed to our core technology and that was already developed by ncr 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing teracube and  thereby  achieving technological feasibility and risk related to the impact of potential changes in future technology 
we intend to incur expenses of approximately  over the next year in order to complete the project 
the project was approximately complete at the time of the acquisition and approximately of the final product s estimated cash in flows are attributable to the acquired teracube technology 
we used a discount rate of when estimating the net present value of the projected incremental cash flows 
remaining development efforts are focused on completing development of certain sub products of teracube that will maximize efficiencies in operation of our business intelligence and e business products and make it compliant with industry standards 
completion of these projects will be necessary before revenues are produced 
we expect to begin to benefit from the purchased in process research and development by the end of if these projects are not successfully developed  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process research and development projects 
deferred compensation expense 
during  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock  of which options to purchase  shares of class a common stock were granted at exercise prices below fair market value 
we will amortize million of compensation expense related to these options ratably over the five year vesting period 
in and  compensation expense was  and  respectively 
we will record additional compensation expense of  in each year beginning through  and  in  if all of the related options vest 
provision for income taxes 
in and  we recorded income tax expense of million and  respectively 
prior to our initial public offering  we had elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
under subchapter s  our income was allocated to our individual stockholders rather than to us 
accordingly  no federal or state income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements  prior to june  when we converted to a c corporation 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents product support and other services fees that are collected in advance  product license and product support and other services fees relating to multiple element software arrangements for which the fair value of each element cannot be established or product license and product support and other services fees relating to arrangements which required implementation related services that are significant to the functionality of features of the software product  including arrangements with subsequent hosting services 
deferred revenue was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to a few large contracts with customers that involved multiple elements  including software products  product support and other services  hosting services and or strategy 
com services and for which our revenue recognition policy requires that the revenues be recognized on a percentage of completion basis or recognized over the entire term of the contract or the hosting period  as applicable 
we expect to recognize approximately million of this deferred revenue in  however  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support and other services  deferred revenue as of any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources from inception until our initial public offering  we primarily financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations and short and long term borrowings 
on june   we raised million  net of offering costs  from our initial public offering  and we raised an additional million  net of offering costs  on february  from a public offering of  shares of class a common stock 
on december  and december   we had million and million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  respectively 
cash provided by operations was  for and cash used in operations was million for the decrease in cash used in operations from to was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred income and prepaid expenses offset by an increase in net loss 
as discussed in the overview  we intend to aggressively pursue financing to allow us to invest significant resources to market  develop and operate strategy 
com 
because of this anticipated ongoing investment  we expect to use significant cash in operations 
cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities from to reflected purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer and office equipment required to support expansion of our operations and building of infrastructure to support strategy 
com 
as of december  we had million in commitments for computer software and equipment 
additionally  in november  we signed a three year master lease agreement to lease up to million of computer equipment  of which we leased approximately million as of march  the lease bears interest at a rate equal to interest on three year us treasury notes plus to 
future draw downs and interest rates under the lease agreement are subject to our credit worthiness 
if the lessor deems our credit unworthy  we may not be able to lease additional equipment under the agreement 
our financing activities provided cash of million and million for and  respectively 
the principal source of cash from financing activities during was from the sale of  shares of class a common stock in which we raised million  net of offering costs 
in march  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank which provides for a million unsecured revolving line of credit for general working capital purposes 
borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus to  depending upon the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the line of credit agreement includes a unused line of credit fee and expires on may  as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
we currently do not comply with all of the covenants contained in the line of credit agreement  but have received a waiver through april  at which time we expect to restructure the credit facility 
if we are not in compliance with all covenants contained in the line of credit agreement  we will not have the right to borrow amounts under the agreement 
we declared a million dividend to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering 
the dividend was paid in the form of notes  prior to the termination of our s corporation election  which occurred immediately prior to the consummation of our initial public offering 
as of december   the entire million of the dividend notes had been repaid 
we will require additional external financing through credit facilities  sale of additional equity or other financing facilities to support our planned investment of significant resources to build the strategy 
com personal intelligence network  to continue to grow the microstrategy software platform business  and to increase both microstrategy and strategy 
com brand awareness 
there are no assurances that such financing facilities would be available on acceptable terms  however  we believe that our existing cash and cash generated internally by operations will meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months with more modest growth in strategy 
com and microstrategy and minimal brand awareness expenditures 
in december  we received approximately  shares adjusted for a two for one stock split of exchange applications  valued at million in consideration for the sale of microstrategy software  technical support and consulting services 
subsequent to year end  we sold approximately  of these shares at an average price of approximately per share 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
subsequently  the sec released sab a  which delayed the implementation date of sab for registrants with fiscal years that begin between december  and march  we are required to be in conformity with the provisions of sab  as amended by sab a  no later than april  and do not expect a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of sab in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for our fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we believe the adoption of sfas nos 
and will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of 
the size  timing and execution of significant orders and shipments  
the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  
the timing of new product announcements  
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  
market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  
the length of our sales cycles  
changes in our operating expenses  
personnel changes  
our success in expanding our direct sales force and adding to our indirect distribution channels  
the pace and success of our international expansion  
delays or deferrals of customer implementation  
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and 
seasonal factors such as a lower pace of new sales in the summer 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
because we plan to expand our business  we expect our operating expenses to increase substantially 
in particular  during we expect to increase significantly the costs associated with marketing  developing and operating our strategy 
com network and with expanding our technical support  research and development and sales and marketing organizations 
we also expect to devote substantial resources to expanding our indirect sales channels and international operations 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
in the short term we may not be able to reduce the actual operating expenses associated with our expansion 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
we have recently introduced strategy 
com and it is uncertain whether it will achieve widespread acceptance we have implemented the finance channel of our strategy 
com network  and our weather and news channels have been introduced on a test basis 
we plan on introducing sports and traffic channels as part of our suite of information channels  but they are still in development 
while we expect to implement these channels on a commercial basis by the end of  we may encounter delays or difficulties in this commercial introduction 
we expect that a portion of our future revenue will depend on fees from subscribers for the use of the strategy 
com network service  from products and services offered through this network  and from royalties from affiliates who bundle our strategy 
com network with their own product and service offerings 
we have not  to date  generated any revenue from our strategy 
com network and may not be able to do so in the future 
if this service  or the products and services offered through it  fail to achieve widespread customer acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  revenue from strategy 
com would be adversely affected if our affiliates do not perceive that the integration of our strategy 
com network with their product and service offerings will increase demand for their products and services or will otherwise be able to generate a sufficient return on their investment in the use of our network 
we intend to make significant expenditures in developing our strategy 
com network  which will result in us incurring operating losses we plan to substantially increase the amounts we will expend on our strategy 
com network compared to the expenses we have incurred to date 
we intend to substantially increase our investment in strategy 
com over the next twelve months to market  develop and operate strategy 
com 
we therefore expect operating losses to increase in we also intend to continue making significant investments in strategy 
com after and therefore believe we will continue to be unprofitable for the foreseeable future 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which would reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while they seek internal approval for the purchase of our products 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products varies widely from one customer to the next 
implementing our product can sometimes last several months  depending on the customer s needs and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
our employees  investors  customers  vendors and lenders may react adversely to the revision of our  and revenues and operating results our future success depends in large part on the support of our key employees  investors  customers  vendors and lenders  who may react adversely to the revision of our  and revenues and operating results 
the revision of our  and revenues and operating results has resulted in substantial amounts of negative publicity about us 
we may not be able to retain key employees and customers if they lose confidence in us  and our vendors and lenders may reexamine their willingness to do business with us 
in addition  investors may lose confidence which may cause the trading price of our class a common stock to decrease 
if we lose the services of our key employees or are unable to retain and attract our existing and new customers  vendors and lenders  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our recognition of deferred revenue is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of actual revenues for succeeding periods our deferred revenue was million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain we intend to grow our business rapidly  including investing substantial amounts in our strategy 
com business and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we may require significant external financing in the future 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including 
market conditions  
our operating performance  and 
investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive to us 
if we are unable to raise capital to fund our growth  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
we face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we and some of our directors and executive officers are named as defendants in a number of private securities litigation matters 
although we intend to defend these actions vigorously  no assurance can be given as to the outcomes 
it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
in addition  the sec has issued a formal order of private investigation in connection with matters relating to our restatement of our financial results 
the sec has requested that we provide the them with certain documents concerning the revision of our financial results and financial reporting documents 
we are cooperating with the sec in connection with this investigation 
regardless of the outcome of any of these actions  it is likely that we will incur substantial defense costs and that such actions will cause a diversion of management time and attention 
we expect that our ability to borrow money under our existing credit facilities will require waivers by our lenders or amendments to those facilities our credit facilities require that we comply with a number of financial covenants 
although we have not borrowed any amounts under our million unsecured line of credit  we do not currently comply with all of the covenants contained in the line of credit agreement  however  we have received a waiver from the lender through april  at which time we expect to restructure the credit facility 
if we are in violation of any financial covenants  we will not have the ability to borrow amounts under this facility 
in addition  we signed a three year master lease agreement to lease up to million of computer equipment  of which we have leased approximately million as of march  future draw downs and interest rates under the lease agreement are subject to our credit worthiness 
if the lessor deems our credit unworthy  we may not be able to lease additional equipment under the agreement 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for e business  e commerce  customer relationship management  portals  business intelligence and internet based and wireless based information networks are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many of our competitors in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with our products and our strategy 
com network 
our most direct competitors provide 
e business products  
customer relationship management products  
e commerce transaction systems  
business intelligence products  
internet and wireless information networks and portals  
vertical internet portals and information networks  and 
wireless communications and wireless access protocol enabled products 
each of these market segments are discussed more fully below 
e business infrastructure software 
in the e business infrastructure market  broadvision  e 
piphany  vignette  net perceptions  broadbase  art technology group  engage technologies  doubleclick and personify all provide products that compete directly or indirectly with our software platform 
many of these companies provide alternatives to our technology for adding intelligence and personalization to e commerce applications 
for example  customer information  such as past purchases  clickstream data and stated preferences  can be used to create a personalized e commerce experience that targets customers with offers and interactions to which they are more likely to respond 
customer relationship management products 
companies that deliver customer relationship management products alone or in conjunction with e commerce applications  such as broadvision  e 
piphany  vignette  and siebel  compete with our intelligent e business products 
e commerce transaction systems 
products that support e commerce transactions  such as those provided by microsoft  ibm  america online s netscape division  broadvision  open market  interworld  and oracle could provide competition for us 
these products have the potential to extend their capabilities to use customer information as the basis for generating targeted  personalized product offers  which would compete with our e business products 
business intelligence products 
in the business intelligence market  we compete with providers of software used to enable businesses to analyze and optimize their operations 
in the enterprise category  which is generally focused on large deployments  information advantage  which was recently acquired by sterling software  competes with us 
in the desktop analysis and reporting category  we face competition from companies such as business objects  cognos  and brio technology 
a third category includes products from companies such as oracle  microsoft  and ibm that are generally bundled with or designed to work with their own relational databases 
web portals and information networks 
web portals and information networks  such as microsoft network  yahoo  lycos  excite  america online and infospace 
com  offer an array of information that is similar to information provided by strategy 
com 
strategy 
com seeks to differentiate itself by 
providing a greater level of personalization  
allowing users to receive the precise information they want across the broadest range of information delivery devices including through email  wireless phone  pager  wireless access protocol enabled products  fax  personal digital assistants and the telephone  and 
partnering with financial institutions  device manufacturers  internet companies  communication carriers  media companies and wireless companies  to embed strategy 
com information services as an ingredient in their own offerings 
one or more of these companies  however  could expand their offerings and reduce our differentiation in these three areas 
vertical internet portals and information networks 
expedia  weather 
com  cnbc 
com  abc 
com  espn 
com  microsoft investor  stockboss  microsoft carpoint  infobeat  internet travel network and others have developed custom applications and products to commercialize  analyze and deliver specific information over the internet 
these systems are usually tailored to one application  such as providing news  sports or weather  but in the aggregate  they offer applications similar to those provided by strategy 
com 
any one of these companies could expand their offerings to more closely compete with strategy 
com 
wireless communications and wireless access protocol enabled products 
wireless communications providers  such as at t  sprint  mci worldcom  nextel communications  british telecom  deutsche telekom  pagenet  nokia  ericsson  aether systems  com and palm offer a variety of mobile phones and wireless devices over which strategy 
com delivers information 
these companies may develop in house information services or partner with other companies to deliver information that is competitive to that offered by strategy 
com 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the e business industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could harm our ability to obtain maintenance revenues for new and existing product licenses on favorable terms 
our business is expanding  and our failure to manage this expansion effectively  as well as the strain on our resources  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition we have been expanding rapidly and we expect to continue expanding our operations 
our total number of employees has grown from on december  to  on december  and we expect the number of employees to continue to increase 
we have placed significant demands on our administrative  operational  financial and personnel resources and expect to continue doing so 
in particular  we expect the current and planned growth of our international operations to lead to increased financial and administrative demands 
for example  expanded facilities will complicate operations  managing relationships with new foreign partners will mean additional administrative burdens  and managing foreign currency risks will require expanded treasury functions 
we may also need to expand our support organization to develop our indirect distribution channels in new and expanded markets and to accommodate growth in our installed customer base 
failure to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the development of our strategy 
com network could divert the time and attention of our senior management from our other business 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  currently is responsible for the strategic planning and direction of both our microstrategy software platform and strategy 
com network businesses 
if mr 
saylor does not effectively manage his time and attention between our businesses  it could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors 
our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  
our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and 
our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time to develop and test major new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  introductions of new competitive products or customer requirements  nor can we be sure that our new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our ability to market our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our microstrategy applications 
although the core database component of our business intelligence solutions is compatible with nearly all enterprise server hardware and operating system combinations  such as os  as  unix and windows  our application server component runs only on the windows operating system 
therefore  our ability to increase sales currently depends on the continued acceptance of the windows operating system 
we cannot market our current business intelligence applications to potential customers who use unix operating systems as their application server 
we would have to invest substantial resources to develop a unix product and we cannot be sure that we could introduce such a product on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
the legal environment regarding collection and use of personal information is uncertain and new laws or government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition although some existing laws govern the collection and use of personal information obtained through the internet or other public data networks  it is unclear whether they apply to us and our products 
most of these laws were adopted before the widespread use and commercialization of the internet and other public data networks 
as a result  the laws do not address the unique issues presented by these media 
due to increasing use of the internet and the dramatically increased access to personal information made possible by technologies like ours  the us federal and various state and foreign governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of personal information of users of the internet and other public data networks 
although we attempt to obtain permission from users prior to collecting or processing their personal data  new laws or regulations governing personal privacy may change the ways in which we and our customers and affiliates may gather this personal information 
there may be significant costs and delays involved with adapting our products to any change in regulations 
our business  and in particular our strategy 
com network  depends upon our receiving detailed personal information about subscribers in order to provide them with the services they select 
privacy concerns may cause some potential subscribers to forego subscribing to our service 
if new laws or regulations prohibit us from using information in the ways that we currently do  or if users opt out of making their personal preferences and information available to us and our affiliates  the utility of our products will decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if personal information is misused by us  our customers or our network affiliates  our legal liability may be increased and our growth may be limited 
the federal trade commission has recently launched investigations of the data collection practices of various internet companies 
in addition  numerous individuals and privacy groups have filed lawsuits or administrative complaints against other companies asserting that they were harmed by the misuse of their personal information 
if comparable legal proceedings were commenced against us  regardless of the merits of the claim  we could be required to spend significant amounts on legal defense and our senior management s time and attention could be diverted from our business 
in addition  demand for our products could be reduced if companies are not permitted to use clickstream data derived from their web sites 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in europe  the european union directive on data protection  a comprehensive administrative and regulatory program  currently limits the ability of companies to collect  store and exchange personal data with other entities 
because the us may not currently provide a level of data protection sufficient to meet the guidelines under the european union directive  us companies could be prohibited from obtaining personal data from or exchanging such data with companies in europe 
our business may suffer if either the internet infrastructure or the wireless communication infrastructure is unable to effectively support the growth in demand placed upon it our strategy 
com network and our other products depend increasingly upon the internet infrastructure and wireless communications infrastructures to collect information and deliver information to customers 
we cannot assure you that either of these infrastructures will continue to effectively support the capacity  speed and security demands placed upon them as they continue to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use and increased requirements for data transmission by users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may incur considerable costs to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure or attacks by hackers 
these outages and delays could impact the web sites using our products or hosting our strategy 
com network and could materially affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing stockholders  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without anyone else s approval or prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of march   holders of our class b common stock owned or controlled  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  controlled  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power  as of march  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of whom are employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of a majority of the holders of outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without seeking anyone else s approval  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
we rely on our strategic channel partners and if we are unable to develop or maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on strategic channel partners  such as original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers  to license and support our products in the united states and internationally 
in particular  for the years ended december    and  channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately   and of our total revenues  respectively 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including some products that compete with ours 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we intend to increase the level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts to continue to expand indirect sales in this manner will be successful 
we cannot be sure that we will attract strategic partners who will market our products effectively and who will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in developing and maintaining successful relationships with those strategic partners 
if we are unable to develop or maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
we rely on our network affiliates to market our strategy 
com network to their customers and if we are unable to enter into arrangements with a sufficient number of affiliates  or if our affiliates are unable to interest their customers in our services  our business will suffer we rely on our network affiliates to market our strategy 
com network to their customers 
we cannot be sure that we will attract affiliates who will market our services effectively 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in recruiting and maintaining successful relationships with affiliates 
if we are unable to recruit affiliates or maintain our relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
third party providers of information and services for our strategy 
com network may fail to provide us such information and services or may also provide such information and services to our competitors we rely on third parties to provide information and services for our strategy 
com network 
for example  we rely on ameritrade to provide users of our strategy 
com network with stock quote information and expect to rely upon a third party to execute trades in securities when this capability is added to our network 
if one or more of these providers were to stop working with us  we would have to rely on other parties to provide the information and services we need 
we cannot predict whether other parties would be willing to do so on reasonable terms 
furthermore  we do not have long term agreements with our providers of information and services and we cannot restrict them from providing similar information and services to our competitors 
as a result  our competitors may be able to duplicate some of the information and services that we provide and may  therefore  find it easier to enter the market for personal intelligence and compete with us 
we rely upon our network affiliates to deliver services we offer through our strategy 
com network and if they have difficulty in doing so  we could be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer we depend upon our affiliates to deliver services to subscribers of our strategy 
com network 
if our affiliates fail to deliver reliable services  we could face liability claims from our subscribers and our reputation could be damaged 
in addition  we will be dependent on the performance of the systems deployed and maintained by these parties  whom we will not control 
we expect to include contractual provisions limiting our liability to the subscriber for failures and delays  but we cannot be sure that these limits will be enforceable or will be sufficient to shield us from liability 
we will seek to obtain liability insurance to cover problems of this sort  but we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or that the amounts of our coverage will be sufficient to cover all potential claims 
our network affiliates will rely on us to maintain the infrastructure of the strategy 
com network and any problems with that infrastructure could expose us to liability from our affiliates and their customers our network affiliates depend on us to maintain the software and hardware infrastructure of our strategy 
com network 
if this infrastructure fails or our affiliates or their customers otherwise experience difficulties or delays in accessing the network  we could face liability claims from them 
we expect to include contractual provisions limiting our liability to our affiliates for system failures and delays  but we cannot be sure that these limits will be enforceable or will be sufficient to shield us from liability 
we will seek to obtain liability insurance to cover problems of this sort  but we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or that the amounts of our coverage will be sufficient to cover all potential claims 
we are vulnerable to system failures which could cause interruptions or disruptions in our service the hardware infrastructure on which the strategy 
com system operates is located at the exodus communications data center in northern virginia 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage this relationship successfully to mitigate any risks associated with having our hardware infrastructure maintained by exodus 
unexpected events such as natural disasters  power losses and vandalism could damage our systems 
telecommunications failures  computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems could adversely affect the operation of our systems 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any damages or interruptions in our systems 
accordingly  we could be required to make capital expenditures in the event of damage 
we do not currently have a formal disaster recovery plan 
periodically  we experience unscheduled system downtime that results in our web site being inaccessible to subscribers 
although we have not suffered material losses during these downtimes to date  if these problems persist in the future  users  network affiliates and advertisers could lose confidence in our services 
system capacity constraints may diminish our ability to generate revenues from strategy 
com a substantial increase in the use of the products and services offered by strategy 
com could strain the capacity of our systems  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
system failures or slowdowns could adversely affect the speed and responsiveness of our strategy 
com network 
these would diminish the experience for our subscribers and affect our reputation 
the ability of our systems to manage a significantly increased volume of transactions in a production environment is unknown 
as a result  we face risks related to our ability to scale up to our expected transaction levels while maintaining satisfactory performance 
if our transaction volume increases significantly  we may need to purchase additional servers and networking equipment to maintain adequate data transmission speeds 
the availability of these products and related services may be limited or their cost may be significant 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights we regard our software products as proprietary and we rely on a combination of federal and international copyright  state and federal trademark and service mark and state and common law trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
we have no patents  no registered trademarks  other than microstrategy r  dss agent r and quickstrike r 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult  and we cannot be certain that we can prevent it  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our products may be susceptible to claims by other companies that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
expanding our international operations will be difficult and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition international sales accounted for   and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we plan to continue expanding our international operations and to enter new international markets 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in order to expand international sales successfully  we must set up additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers and distributors 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so in a timely manner  and our failure to do so may limit our international sales growth 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
costs of localizing products for foreign countries  
lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  
longer accounts receivable payment cycles  
difficulties in managing international operations  
tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  
weaker intellectual property protection in other countries  and 
the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors or defects  especially when first or subsequent versions are released 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in new products after their introduction 
we cannot be certain that  despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions 
although there have been no product liability claims against us to date  our license and support of products may involve the risk of these claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  fixed income financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the british pound sterling and the german deutsche mark 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  our foreign currency gains and losses have been immaterial
