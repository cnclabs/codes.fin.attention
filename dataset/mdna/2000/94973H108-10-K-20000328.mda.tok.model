the company s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under factors that may affect future results of operations 
general the company is one of the nation s largest publicly traded managed health care companies 
as of december   wellpoint had approximately million medical members and approximately million specialty members 
the company offers a broad spectrum of network based managed care plans 
wellpoint provides these plans to the large and small employer  individual and senior markets 
the company s managed care plans include hmos  ppos  pos plans  other hybrid medical plans and traditional indemnity plans 
in addition  the company offers managed care services  including underwriting  actuarial services  network access  medical cost management and claims processing 
the company also provides a broad array of specialty and other products  including pharmacy  dental  utilization management  life insurance  preventive care  disability insurance  behavioral health  cobra and flexible benefits account administration 
the company markets its products in california under the name blue cross of california and outside of california under the name unicare 
historically  the company s primary market for managed care products has been california 
the company holds the exclusive right in california to market its products under the blue cross name and mark 
sale of workers compensation segment on july   wellpoint entered into a stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement by and between wellpoint and fremont indemnity company fremont 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  fremont acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of unicare specialty services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of wellpoint unicare specialty 
the transaction was completed on september  the principal asset of unicare specialty was the capital stock of unicare workers compensation insurance company unicare workers compensation 
the purchase price for the acquisition was the statutory surplus adjusted in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement of unicare workers compensation as of the date of the closing 
the purchase price based upon adjusted statutory surplus of unicare workers compensation as of september   the closing date of the transaction  was approximately million  after closing adjustments 
subsequent to september   the company and fremont are jointly marketing integrated workers compensation and medical insurance products in the small employer group market 
based upon the results of a post closing audit  the company made a payment of approximately million in final settlement of the purchase price 
national expansion and other recent developments in an effort to pursue the expansion of the company s business outside the state of california  the company acquired two businesses in and  the life and health benefits management division mmhd of massachusetts mutual life insurance company and the group benefits operations the gbo of john hancock mutual life insurance company 
the company s march  acquisition of rush prudential health plans and its pending transaction with cerulean companies  inc cerulean are also components of this expansion strategy 
as a result of the gbo and mmhd acquisitions  the company has significantly expanded its operations outside of california 
in order to integrate its acquired businesses and implement the company s regional expansion strategy  the company will need to develop satisfactory networks of hospitals  physicians and other health care service providers  develop distribution channels for its products and successfully convert acquired books of business to the company s existing information systems  which will require continued investments by the company 
in response to rising medical and pharmacy costs the company has recently implemented premium increases with respect to certain of its products 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for further premium increases  plan design changes and other appropriate actions in the future in order to maintain or restore profit margins 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will be able to take subsequent pricing or other actions or that any actions previously taken or implemented in the future will be successful in addressing any concerns that may arise with respect to the performance of certain businesses 
acquisition of rush prudential on march   the company completed its acquisition of rush prudential health plans rush prudential 
rush prudential offers a broad array of products and services ranging from hmo products to traditional ppo products 
the acquisition has more than doubled the company s current illinois medical membership to nearly  members 
the transaction  which was financed with cash  is valued at approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
this acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
pending acquisition of cerulean on july   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cerulean see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cerulean  principally through its blue cross and blue shield of georgia subsidiary  offers insured and administrative services products primarily in the state of georgia 
cerulean has historically experienced a higher administrative expense ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher concentration of administrative services business 
cerulean has also historically experienced a higher medical loss ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher percentage of large group business and fewer managed care offerings 
accordingly  it is expected that cerulean s higher loss and administrative expense ratios will ultimately contribute to an increase in those ratios for the company after the transaction is completed 
the transaction is expected to be completed during legislation in september  the california legislature enacted and the california governor subsequently signed into law a number of health care reform measures 
federal legislation enacted during the last four years seeks  among other things  to insure the portability of health coverage and mandates minimum maternity hospital stays 
california legislation enacted during  among other things  establishes an explicit duty on managed care entities to exercise ordinary care in arranging for the provision of medically necessary health care services and establishes a system of independent medical review 
in  texas adopted legislation purporting to make managed care organizations such as the company liable for their failure to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions 
similar legislation has also been enacted in georgia 
these and other proposed measures may have the effect of dramatically altering the regulation of health care and of increasing the company s loss ratio and administrative costs or decreasing the affordability of the company s products 
year the company is substantially dependent on its computer systems  business applications and other information technology systems it systems  due to the nature of its managed health care business and the increasing number of electronic transactions in the industry 
historically  many it systems were developed to recognize the year as a two digit number  with the digits being recognized as the year as a result  the year presented a number of potential problems for such systems  including potentially significant processing errors or failure 
given the company s reliance on its computer systems to process health care transactions  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any significant errors or failures 
additionally  the year presented potential problems for other systems and applications containing date dependent embedded microprocessors non it systems  such as elevators and heating and ventilation equipment 
beginning in and continuing throughout and  the company developed and implemented a comprehensive plan designed to address the year issue for its it and non it systems and applications 
this plan included a detailed risk assessment of the company s various computer systems  business applications and other affected systems  the completion of remediation efforts  on going internal testing and third party review of certain of its year remediation efforts 
as part of its year readiness efforts  the company s various business units formulated detailed contingency plans in order to address unexpected year readiness issues or issues beyond the company s control 
these contingency plans focused on identifying potential failure scenarios for the company s it and non it systems and those of third parties with which the company interacts and on ensuring the continuation of critical business operations 
during the year ended december   the company spent approximately million for remediation of its it software systems and applications  approximately million for renovation or replacement of its telecommunications equipment 
the company expensed year remediation costs as incurred and funded these costs through cash flow from operations 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant disruptions in its operations as a result of year issues nor is the company aware of any significant year related disruptions experienced by any other company with which the company interacts on a regular basis 
the company will continue to monitor its it and non it systems throughout with respect to year compliance issues 
if the company were to experience any year issues  either as a result of a failure of its own systems or those of third parties with which it interacts  the company could be subject to a number of potential consequences including  among others  inability to timely and accurately process health care claims  collect customers premiums and administrative fees  verify subscriber eligibility  assess utilization trends or compile accurate financial data for use by management 
the company is attempting to limit its exposure to any year issues by closely monitoring its on going year readiness efforts  assessing the year readiness efforts of various third party with which it interacts and developing contingency plans addressing potential problems that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

such additional indebtedness may require that a significant amount of the company s cash flow be applied to the payment of interest  and there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient cash flow to service the indebtedness 
any additional indebtedness may adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations and could limit its ability to pursue business opportunities that may be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
as part of the company s business strategy  over the past four years the company has acquired substantial operations in new geographic markets 
as discussed above  the company has entered into a merger agreement with cerulean  pursuant to which cerulean will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
these businesses  which include substantial indemnity based insurance operations  have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
since the relevant dates of acquisition of mmhd and gbo  the company has continued to work extensively on the integration of these businesses  however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of the company s integration efforts or regarding the ability of the company to maintain or improve the results of operations of the businesses of completed or pending transactions as the company pursues its strategy of motivating the acquired members to select managed care products 
in order to implement this business strategy  the company has incurred and will  among other things  need to continue to incur considerable expenditures for provider networks  distribution channels and information systems in addition to the costs associated with the integration of these acquisitions 
the integration of these complex businesses may result in  among other things  temporary increases in claims inventory or other service related issues that may negatively affect the company s relationship with its customers and contribute to increased attrition of such customers 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the company experiences such problems or is otherwise unable to implement fully its expansion strategy 
the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  state and local agencies in all jurisdictions in which the company operates 
many of these agencies have increased their scrutiny of managed health care companies in recent periods 
the company also provides insurance products to medi cal beneficiaries in various california counties under contracts with the california department of health services or delegated local agencies and provides administrative services to the health care finance administration hcfa in various capacities 
there can be no assurance that acting as a government contractor in these circumstances will not increase the risk of heightened scrutiny by such government agencies and that profitability from this business will not be adversely affected through inadequate premium rate increases due to governmental budgetary issues 
future actions by any regulatory agencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to capital surplus requirements by the california department of corporations  various other state departments of insurance and the blue cross blue shield association 
although the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all applicable requirements  there can be no assurances that such requirements will not be increased in the future 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs incurred on existing business and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in mandated benefits  utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
periodic renegotiation of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
recently  large physician practice management companies have experienced extreme financial difficulties including bankruptcy  which may subject the company to increased credit risk related to provider groups 
additionally  the company faces competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  select underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
managed care organizations  both inside and outside california  operate in a highly competitive environment that has undergone significant change in recent years as a result of business consolidations  new strategic alliances  aggressive marketing practices by competitors and other market pressures 
additional increases in competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
additional increases in competition including competition from market entrants offering internet based products and services  could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
as a result of the company s recent acquisitions  the company operates on a select geographic basis nationally and offers a spectrum of health care and specialty products through various risk sharing arrangements 
the company s health care products include a variety of managed care offerings as well as traditional fee for service coverage 
with respect to product type  fee for service products are generally less profitable than managed care products 
a critical component of the company s expansion strategy is to transition over time the traditional insurance members of the company s acquired businesses to more managed care products 
with respect to the risk sharing nature of products  managed care products that involve greater potential risk to the company generally tend to be more profitable than management services products and those managed care products where the company is able to shift risks to employer groups 
individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase the company s higher risk managed care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures 
typically  government sponsored programs involve the company s higher risk managed care products 
over the past few years  the company has experienced greater margin erosion in its higher risk managed care products than in its lower risk managed care and management services products 
this margin erosion is attributable to product mix change  product design  competitive pressure and greater regulatory restrictions applicable to the small employer group market 
in response to pressure on margins in and again in  the company implemented price increases in certain of its managed care businesses 
while these price increases are intended to improve profitability  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
subsequent unfavorable changes in the relative profitability between the company s various products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and on the continued feasibility of the company s geographic expansion strategy 
substantially all of the company s investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase or increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  the value of equity securities can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions 
changes in the value of the company s investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  can affect the company s stockholders equity which could impact leverage ratios  credit ratings or compliance with covenants of its revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurances that interest rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company is dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet its future needs 
the company faces intense competition for qualified information technology personnel and other skilled professionals 
there can be no assurances that an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company regularly evaluates its asset and liability interest rate risks as well as the appropriateness of investments relative to its internal investment guidelines 
the company operates within these guidelines by maintaining a well diversified portfolio  both across and within asset classes 
the company has retained an independent consultant to advise the company on the appropriateness of its investment policy and the compliance therewith 
asset interest rate risk is managed within a duration band tied to the company s liability interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by maintaining high average quality ratings and a well diversified portfolio 
the company s use of derivative instruments is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of forward exchange contracts intended to minimize the portfolio s exposure to currency volatility associated with certain foreign demoninated bond holdings 
the company s investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for leveraging purposes as well as the creation of risk exposures not otherwise allowed within the policy 
since  the company has from time to time entered into interest rate swap agreements primarily by exchanging the floating debt payments due under its outstanding indebtedness for fixed rate payments 
the company believes that this allows it to better anticipate its interest payments while helping to manage the asset liability relationship 
interest rate risk as of december   approximately of the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities maturing in more than one year  the value of which generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates 
the company has evaluated the net impact to the fair value of its fixed income investments from a hypothetical change in all interest rates of  and basis points bp 
in doing so  optionality was addressed through monte carlo simulation of the price behavior of securities with embedded options 
in addressing prepayments on mortgage backed securities  the model follows the normal market practice of estimating a non interest rate sensitive component primarily related to relocations and an interest sensitive component primarily related to refinancings separately 
the model is based on statistical techniques applied to historical prepayment and market data  and then incorporates forward looking mortgage market research and judgments about future prepayment behavior 
changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio are reflected in the balance sheet through stockholders equity 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 effective january   all derivative financial instruments will be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value 
the results of this analysis as of december  are reflected in the table below 
increase decrease in fair value given an interest rate increase of bp bp bp in millions fixed income portfolio results as of december  are reflected in the table below 
the table reflects the change in valuation of interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december  to the extent that the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements exceeded the principal balance of the company s floating rate indebtedness 
increase decrease in fair value given an interest rate increase of bp bp bp in millions fixed income portfolio valuation of interest rate swap agreements the company believes that an interest rate shift in a month period of bp represents a moderately adverse outcome  while a bp shift is significantly adverse and a bp shift is unlikely given historical precedents 
although the company holds its bonds as available for sale for purposes of sfas no 
 the company s cash flows and the short duration of its investment portfolio should allow it to hold securities to maturity  thereby avoiding the recognition of losses  should interest rates rise significantly 
interest rate swap agreements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to reduce the volatility of interest expense resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had entered into million of floating to fixed rate swap agreements and also had million of libor based floating rate debt outstanding 
the company also receives a libor based payment as a result of its swap arrangements  thereby eliminating the payment exposure to changes in interest rates on that million of outstanding debt 
in  the company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to exchange three month libor the index associated with the aforementioned swap for one month libor the index associated with the revolving credit facility in order to hedge against rising interest rates at the end of the year 
equity price risk the company s equity securities are comprised primarily of domestic stocks as well as certain foreign holdings 
assuming an immediate decrease of in equity prices  as of december  and  the hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity is estimated to be approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange risk the company has generally hedged the foreign exchange risk associated with its fixed income portfolio 
the company generally uses short term foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain fixed income securities denominated in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company believes that there is minimal risk to the fixed income portfolio due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s hedging program related to its foreign currency denominated investments is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not hedge its foreign exchange risk arising from equity investments denominated in foreign currencies 
assuming a foreign exchange loss of across all foreign equity investments  the net hypothetical pre tax loss in fair value as of december  and  is estimated to be million and million  respectively
