year from to  the company made the modifications and replacements necessary to assure its systems and equipment would not experience problems handling dates in the year costs directly associated with achieving year compliance  including modifying computer software or converting to new programs  consist of payments to third parties as well as an allocation of the payroll and benefits of its employees based on the amount of their time devoted to this activity 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
costs for new hardware are capitalized in accordance with the company s fixed asset policy  and any equipment retired is written off 
the following table summarizes the company s direct year compliance expenditures by year in thousands expenses paid to third parties allocated payroll costs capital expenditures in addition to work undertaken explicitly to achieve year compliance  the company has replaced or upgraded a number of systems in the ordinary course of business where the replacement or upgrade will  in addition to its primary benefits  also provide year compliance 
the nature of these costs  and their accounting treatment  is the same as described above 
the following table summarizes the company s expenditures on systems improvements undertaken for reasons unrelated to the year  but also serving to achieve year compliance in thousands expenses paid to third parties allocated payroll costs capital expenditures  contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi  which are considered incidental to its business 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the company operates internationally  principally in canada  europe and the far east  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect the company s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
for foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect abi s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices
