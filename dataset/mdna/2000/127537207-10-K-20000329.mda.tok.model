item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the consolidated financial statements set forth herein for each of the three years in the period ended december   reflect the results of operations of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries including sun world 
a summary of the sun world elements which management of the company believes is essential to an analysis of the results of operations for such periods is presented below 
for purposes of this summary  the term sun world will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to the operations and activities of the company s sun world subsidiary  and the term cadiz will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to those operations and activities of the company not involving sun world 
the company s net income or loss in future fiscal periods will be largely reflective of a the operations of the company s water development activities including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program the program and b the operations of sun world 
sun world conducts its operations through four operating divisions farming  packing  marketing and proprietary product development 
net income from farming operations varies from year to year primarily due to yield and pricing fluctuations which can be significantly influenced by weather conditions  and are  therefore  generally subject to greater annual variation than sun world s other divisions 
however  the geographic distribution of sun world s farming operations within california and the diversity of its crop mix makes it unlikely that adverse weather conditions would affect all of sun world s properties or all of its crops in any single year 
nevertheless  net profit from sun world s packing  marketing and proprietary product development operations tends to be more consistent from year to year than net profit from sun world s farming operations 
as such  sun world continues to strategically add volume in the packing and marketing areas that will complement sun world s in house production or fill in contra seasonal marketing windows 
packing and marketing revenues from third party growers currently represent less than ten percent of total company revenues 
sun world has entered into agreements internationally to license selected proprietary fruit varieties and continues to pursue additional domestic and international licensing opportunities 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company s agricultural operations are impacted by the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 
sun world has historically received the majority of its net income during the months of june to october following the harvest and sale of its table grape and stonefruit crops 
due to this concentrated activity  sun world has  therefore  historically incurred a loss with respect to its agricultural operations in the other months during the year

liquidity and capital resources general discussion of liquidity and capital resources based on the cash on hand at december  and the revolving credit facility in place for sun world and anticipated payments under the program  as further discussed below  the company believes it will be able to meet its working capital needs over the next year without looking to additional outside funding sources  although no assurances can be made 
see current financing arrangements below 
under sun world s historical working capital cycle  working capital is required primarily to finance the costs of growing and harvesting crops  which generally occur from january through september with a peak need in june 
sun world harvests and sells the majority of its crops during the period from june through october  when it receives the majority of its revenues 
in order to bridge the gap between incurrence of expenditures and receipt of revenues  large cash outlays are required each year which are financed through a million revolving credit agreement the sun world revolver 
see current financing arrangements sun world s obligations below 
current financing arrangements cadiz obligations as cadiz has not received significant revenues from its water resource activity to date  cadiz has been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  cadiz has addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements with its lenders  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   cadiz was obligated for approximately million under a senior term loan facility 
during  the company entered into two extensions of the loan which extended the maturity date of the obligation to january   and reduced the interest rate from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points  payable semi annually 
in connection with obtaining the extensions  the company issued certain warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock and also repriced certain warrants previously issued

the company had million outstanding under the cadiz revolver at december  as the company continues to actively pursue its business strategy  additional financing specifically in connection with the company s water programs may be required 
responsibility for funding the design  construction and program implementation costs of the capital facilities for the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program will  under currently developed principles and terms  be shared equally by the company and the metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan 
the company is analyzing various alternatives for funding its share of the estimated million to million cost of the program capital facilities 
these funding alternatives include a long term financing arrangements  b utilization of monies to be received from metropolitan for its initial purchase of  acre feet of indigenous groundwater  and c financing through metropolitan by offsetting cadiz costs for capital facilities financing against payments due to cadiz for stored or transferred water 
based upon the results of analyses performed by investment banking firms retained by the company  management believes that several alternative long term financing arrangements are available to the company 
sun world obligations sun world has outstanding million of first mortgage notes the sun world notes which will mature on april  and are publicly traded and are registered under the securities act of the sun world notes are redeemable at the option of sun world  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  interest accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually on april and october of each year

no amount was outstanding under the intercompany revolver as of december  cash used for operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to cash used for operating activities of million for the year ended december  the reduction in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to improved farming results from sun world offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory primarily resulting from the increased farming operations at december  associated with sun world s two new citrus ranches which were acquired during the fourth quarter of cash used for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the same period in in october  sun world received an initial distribution of million from a owned partnership  american sunmelon

outlook the company is actively pursuing the development of its water resources 
specifically  in july  the company and metropolitan approved the principles and terms for agreement for the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
the principles and terms for agreement provide that metropolitan will  during wet years or periods of excess supply  store surplus water from its colorado river aqueduct in the groundwater basin underlying the company s property 
during dry years or times of reduced allocations from the colorado river  the previously imported water  together with additional existing groundwater  will be extracted and delivered  via a conveyance pipeline  back to the aqueduct 
based upon negotiations with metropolitan  the terms of the agreement are anticipated to be as follows over the year term of the agreement  metropolitan will store a minimum of  acre feet of colorado river aqueduct water in the company s groundwater basin and purchase up to a minimum of  acre feet of existing groundwater for transfer during dry years 
the program will have the capacity to convey  either for storage or transfer  up to approximately  acre feet in any given year 
during storage operations  metropolitan will pay a fee per acre foot for put of water into storage and a fee per acre foot for return of water from storage  and a storage fee of per acre foot every year that water is stored in the groundwater basin for the first million acre feet of stored water 
on the transfer of water  metropolitan will pay a base rate of approximately per acre foot  which will be adjusted according to a water price formula 
additionally  recognizing that delivery of the company s high quality  indigenous groundwater to the aqueduct provides a significant water quality benefit  metropolitan will pay the company a water quality fee for both transferred and returned water 
metropolitan will purchase the first  acre feet in two installments million payable upon environmental certification and the balance of million  subject to adjustment for the water price index  payable upon completion of construction 
finally  metropolitan will commit to purchase the additional  acre feet at the earlier of delivery or in annual  acre feet increments commencing at the start of operations 
the program facilities  including spreading basins  extraction wells  conveyance pipeline and a pumping plant  are estimated to cost between and million  and both parties will share these costs 
all operational costs of the program  including annual operations  maintenance and energy costs  will be the obligation of metropolitan 
the principles and terms for agreement call for the establishment of a comprehensive groundwater monitoring and management plan to ensure long term protection of the groundwater basin 
the final agreement may reflect adjustments to these principles and terms in order to reflect information identified during the ongoing environmental review process and will be subject to the approval of the respective boards of both parties 
also  see narrative description of business water resource development cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
in addition to the development of its water resources  the company is actively involved in further agricultural development and reinvestment in its landholdings 
such development will be systematic and in furtherance of the company s business strategy to provide for maximization of the value of its assets 
the company also continually evaluates acquisition opportunities  which are complimentary to its current portfolio of water and agricultural resources 
the company believes that  based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  sun world can adequately service its indebtedness and meet its seasonal working capital needs utilizing available internal cash  the sun world revolver and  if necessary  through an intercompany revolver with cadiz 
cadiz expects to be able to meet its ordinary working capital needs  in the short term  through a combination of cash on hand  payments under the program  quarterly management fee payments from sun world  payments from sun world under an agricultural lease whereby sun world now operates the company s  acres of developed agricultural property at cadiz  california  and the possible exercise of outstanding stock options 
except for the foregoing  additional intercompany cash payments between sun world and cadiz are subject to certain restrictions under its current lending arrangements 
year to date  the company has not experienced any problems related to year yk within its own operations or with any significant customers or vendors 
as such  management does not anticipate any significant yk issues will occur in the future 
certain trends and uncertainties in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
the company wishes to caution readers that these factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any projected  estimated or forward looking statements relating to the company 
the following factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by the company or its representatives  including any forward looking discussion  as well as comments contained in press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  or other communications by the company 
in making these statements  the company is not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding the company s business or results  and is not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes to discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  certain of these matters may have affected the company s past results and may affect future results 
risks inherent in agricultural operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with its agricultural operations 
numerous factors can affect the price  yield and marketability of the crops grown on the company s properties 
crop prices may vary greatly from year to year as a result of the relationship between production and market demand 
for example  the production of a particular crop in excess of demand in any particular year will depress market prices  and inflationary factors and other unforeseeable economic changes may also  at the same time  increase operating costs with respect to such crops 
in addition  the agricultural industry in the united states is highly competitive  and domestic growers and produce marketers are facing increased competition from abroad  particularly from mexico 
there are also a number of factors outside of the company s control that could  alone or in combination  materially adversely affect the company s agricultural operations  such as adverse weather conditions  insects  blight or other diseases  labor problems such as boycotts or strikes and shortages of competent laborers 
the company s operations may also be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies  social and economic conditions  and industry production levels 
risks of water development projects 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses from its non sun world operations until such time as it is able to receive significant revenues from the development of its water development projects  including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
in addition to the risks associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits with respect to the company s water development projects  the company may also encounter unforeseen technical difficulties  which could result in construction delays  and cost increases or determination that a project is not feasible 
the company is continuing to negotiate the terms and conditions of water storage and supply programs with various california water agencies including metropolitan with respect to preparing the final agreement for the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
however  the outcome of these negotiations cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties  including hydrologic risks of variable water supplies  risks presented by allocations of water under existing and prospective priorities  and risks of adverse changes to or interpretations of us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
other important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the company or on behalf of the company are discussed elsewhere within this form k in the sections entitled seasonality  regulation  competition  and liquidity and capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
other instruments  such as interest rate swaps  options  floors  caps or collars may also be used depending upon market conditions 
no such instruments were used in the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interests rates  and fair values by year of scheduled maturities to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes in thousands of dollars
