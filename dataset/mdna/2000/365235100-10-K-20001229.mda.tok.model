a restaurant is included in this computation after it has been open for full calendar months 
as a result  a restaurant may be included in this computation for only a portion of a given quarter or year 
the company s restaurants experience seasonal influences  as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is realized during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings  and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its cash requirements principally from cash flow from operating activities  bank debt  mortgage and capital lease financing and sale of common stock 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory  and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms when purchasing food and supplies 
for the year ended september   the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities  received million from bank debt and equipment financing offset by payments of million  and received million from the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
as of september   the company had borrowed all of its million bank line of credit 
such credit line bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate  which totaled per annum as of september   or libor rounded to the nearest whole of plus 
as of september   million of the million credit line was borrowed at libor 
the credit agreement will expire on december  and contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends or to effect mergers or acquisitions without the bank s approval 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by equipment and other assets 
in connection with the development of new restaurants  the company has over time obtained mortgage and equipment financing from approximately nine lenders  each of which has financed multiple loans 
the outstanding balance of each loan generally is between million and million 
the loans have varying maturity rates extending through august  interest rates generally ranging from through with an average interest rate of per annum  and in certain cases  pre payment penalties of one to two percent 
as of september   the outstanding balances on such loans aggregated approximately million 
the company s principal capital requirement has been and will continue to be funding the development of restaurants 
for the year ended september   capital expenditures totaled million  million of which funded the development of new restaurants  offset by million in capital reductions due to sale lease back of two restaurant locations 
the remaining capital expenditures primarily funded replacements and new additions at existing restaurants 
in addition to budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal of million for new restaurant openings  the company has budgeted million in expenditures for fiscal for capital improvements at existing sites 
see business unit economics 
the company believes that i internally generated funds  ii available borrowings under the bank credit line  iii funds that it will be able to borrow pursuant to secured credit facilities consistent with its past practices and iv sale lease back of some of its owned properties will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through at least the end of fiscal if these sources of financing are insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to the company on favorable terms  or at all 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to guests 
new accounting standard effective october  the company adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  sop 
sop requires that the costs of start up activities  which are inclusive of pre opening costs  should be expensed as incurred 
as is typical in the restaurant industry  prior to october  the company had deferred its restaurant pre opening costs and amortized them over the twelve month period following the opening of each respective restaurant 
the company recognized the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of the related income tax effect of million 
business risks in addition to other information in this form k  shareholders and prospective investors should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating the company and its business 
certain operating results and considerations in fiscal  and  the company experienced an increase of  and respectively  in comparable restaurant sales 
the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period 
in addition  the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases 
as a result  the company does not believe that recent comparable restaurant sales are indicative of future trends in comparable restaurant sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales may be modest 
see selected financial data 
expansion risks the company opened eight salad buffet restaurants in fiscal  ten in fiscal and seventeen in fiscal the company currently intends to open eleven restaurants in fiscal the company may experience difficulty in opening eleven restaurants in fiscal  including but not limited to hiring qualified restaurant managers and staff 
the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  qualified managers  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals  construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
in addition  since its inception  the company has closed three non performing restaurants 
given the number of restaurants in current operation and the company s projected expansion rate  there can be no assurances that the company will not close restaurants in the future 
any closure could result in a significant write off of assets  which could adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
owned restaurants generally require significantly more up front capital than leased restaurants 
as a result  an increase in the percentage of owned restaurant openings as compared to historical practice would increase the capital required to meet the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
see restaurant industry and competition  business expansion strategy and business competition 
restaurant industry and competition the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food products offered  quality of service  price  dining experience  restaurant location and the ambiance of the facilities 
the company s primary competitors include mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  as well as traditional self service buffet and other soup and salad restaurants and healthful and nutrition oriented restaurants 
the company competes with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the number of buffet and casual restaurants with operations generally similar to the company s has grown substantially in the last several years and the company believes competition among buffet style and casual restaurants has increased and will continue to increase as the company s competitors expand operations in various geographic areas 
such increased competition could increase the company s operating costs or adversely affect its revenues 
the company believes it competes favorably in the industry  although many of the company s competitors which have been in existence longer than the company  have a more established market presence and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company  which may give them certain competitive advantages 
in addition  the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry 
therefore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not be able to successfully imitate and implement the company s concept 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
cost sensitivity the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future 
see reliance on key suppliers and distributors  and business 
importance of key employees the company is heavily dependent upon the services of its officers and key management personnel involved in restaurant operations  purchasing  expansion and administration 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the management and leadership of its four executive officers  michael p 
mack  david w 
qualls  r 
gregory keller and kenneth j 
keane 
the loss of any of these four individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of the company and its individual restaurants depends upon the company s ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified restaurant operations and other management personnel 
the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
see business restaurant operations restaurant management and business restaurant operations customer service 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business experiences seasonal fluctuations as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized in the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
see quarterly results and seasonality 
geographic concentration in california and florida  restaurant base thirty four of the company s existing salad buffet restaurants are located in california and eighteen are located in florida 
accordingly  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these regions  including natural disasters  such as hurricanes which have occurred annually in recent years in florida  or other acts of god that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s significant investment in  and long term commitment to  each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company has a small number of restaurants relative to some of its competitors 
consequently  a decline in the profitability of an existing restaurant or the introduction of an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s result of operations than would be the case in a company with a larger number of restaurants 
see business restaurant facilities and business expansion strategy 
reliance on key suppliers and distributors the company utilizes sole source suppliers for certain produce and grocery items 
in addition  in order to minimize price fluctuations  the company enters into fixed price supply contracts that typically have terms of two months to one year and generally do not have minimum purchase requirements 
however  in the event that the company s suppliers are unable to make the required deliveries due to shortages or interruptions caused by adverse weather or other conditions or are relieved of their contract obligations due to an invocation of an act of god provision  the company would need to renegotiate these contracts or purchase such products and groceries elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that the company s produce and grocery costs would not as a result be higher  and such higher costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the company has several local produce distributors that are governed by one program and two main grocery distributors 
all produce and groceries purchased by the company are channeled from the growers and other suppliers to the company s restaurants and central kitchens through these distributors 
in the event that any of these distributors were to cease distribution on behalf of the company  the company would be required to make alternate arrangements for produce and grocery distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company s distribution expense would not be greater under such alternate arrangements 
see cost sensitivity and business restaurant operations 
legal matters the company is from time to time the subject of complaints  threat letters or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect the company and its restaurants  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether the company is liable 
the company is party to various legal actions relating to former employees 
in the opinion of management  after reviewing the information which is currently available with respect to these matters  and consulting with the company s counsel  any liability which may ultimately be incurred will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the company 
see legal proceedings 
government regulation the company s business is subject to and affected by various federal  state and local laws 
each restaurant must comply with state  county and municipal licensing and regulation requirements relating to health  safety  sanitation  building construction and fire prevention 
in addition  the company is required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government  states and municipalities where its restaurants are located 
typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the company s restaurants  including minimum age of guests and employees  hours of operation  advertising  wholesale purchasing  inventory control and handling  storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages 
failure to comply with federal  state or local regulations could cause the company s licenses to be revoked or force it to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of its restaurants 
difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of additional restaurants 
the company has not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining licenses and approvals to date  however  beer and wine licenses are not always available to the company as a result of the location of certain of its restaurants 
the company is subject to state dram shop laws and regulations  which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person 
while the company carries liquor liability coverage as part of its existing comprehensive general liability insurance  there can be no assurance that it will not be subject to a judgment in excess of such insurance coverage or that it will be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs  or at all 
the company s restaurants are subject to federal and state laws governing wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
congress and various states including california passed proposals that imposed increases in state or federal minimum wages in   and there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to pass increased costs on to its guests 
the company is subject to the americans with disabilities act of  which requires certain accommodations to the company s restaurant designs to allow access for people with disabilities 
in addition  the company is subject to the regulations of the immigration and naturalization service ins 
given the location of many of the company s restaurants  even if the company s operation of those restaurants is in strict compliance with ins requirements  the company s employees may not all meet federal citizenship or residency requirements  which could lead to disruptions in its work force 
additionally  legislative proposals are currently under consideration by congress and state legislators to require employers to pay for health insurance for all employees 
anti takeover measures certain provisions of the company s restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
certain of these provisions allow the company to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of the holders of the common stock 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated since the initial public offering of the common stock in may quarterly operating results of the company and other restaurant companies  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the restaurant industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term interest rates as the company s line of credit is tied to the prime rate 
as of september   the company had million in debt outstanding under the credit facility 
based on a hypothetical basis point adverse change in prime rates  net interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise would decrease earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on debt  nor can there be any assurance that long term fixed rate debt will be available at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated results due to adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
the company did not have any foreign currency or other market risk or any derivative financial instruments at september
