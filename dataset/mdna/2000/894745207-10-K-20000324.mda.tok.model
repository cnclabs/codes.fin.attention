the following information with respect to timet commission file number has been summarized from such reports which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of timet 
general 
titanium metals corporation timet is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and has the largest sales volume worldwide 
timet is the only integrated producer with major titanium processing facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
the demand for titanium reached a peak in when worldwide mill products shipments reached  metric tons 
since this peak  annual shipments declined to  metric tons in and a further to  metric tons in timet estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of world sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in diverse uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive and architectural uses 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
timet believes it is among the lower cost producers of titanium sponge and melt products due in part to its economies of scale  manufacturing expertise and investment in technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
timet believes that at least of the world s titanium sponge is produced by six companies 
timet intends to continue its focus on the following long term goals and objectives to change the traditional way business is conducted o maximize the long term value of its core aerospace business by focusing on timet s basic strengths of sponge production  melting and forging of various shapes of titanium products  and by entering into strategic agreements with major titanium users to help mitigate the cyclicality of timet s aerospace business 
o invest in strategic alliances  including joint ventures  acquisitions and entrepreneurial arrangements  as well as new markets  applications and products  to help reduce traditional dependence on the aerospace sector 
o invest in technology  capacity and innovative projects aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity  quality  customer service and production capabilities 
o stabilize the cost and supply of raw materials 
o maintain a strong balance sheet 
timet s focus in the short term is to return to profitability as quickly as possible by reducing costs  improving quality and streamlining its overall business and manufacturing processes 
to that end  timet has o limited planned capital expenditures to include those principally intended for capital maintenance  environmental  health and safety purposes 
o rationalized staffing and production worldwide to fit current market conditions 
o suspended the dividend on its common stock 
o negotiated new credit agreements to provide liquidity through the current down cycle 
o initiated a plan to reduce overhead  inventory and receivables 
timet intends to consider further means to reduce costs if the foregoing do not prove sufficient to return to profitability 
current industry conditions and outlook for the titanium industry historically has derived the majority of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the historical fluctuations in performance of titanium companies  which had cyclical peaks in mill products shipments in  and and cyclical lows in and during the period  timet reported aggregate net income of million  which substantially more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult period 
timet currently expects that the loss in will exceed the loss and looks to return to profitability in late worldwide industry mill products shipments of approximately  metric tons in were above levels 
in  industry mill product shipments declined approximately  to approximately  metric tons  with a further decline to approximately  metric tons in expectations for are a further decline in mill product shipments although it is expected to be less than the decline as experienced during each of the last two years 
timet believes that the reduction in demand for aerospace products is attributable to a decline in the number of aircraft forecast to be produced  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes  compounded by reductions in inventories throughout the aerospace industry supply chain as customers adjust to the decreases in overall production rates 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components such as rotor blades  discs  rings and engine cases  and air frame components  such as bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear and wing supports  can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
industry shipments to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of total aerospace demand of total titanium demand 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of over billion estimated in  compared to billion in each of and timet believes that commercial aircraft deliveries peaked in current expected deliveries for and  while below the record levels of and  are still high by historical standards  and the current generations of airplanes use substantially more titanium than their predecessors 
the demand for titanium generally precedes aircraft deliveries by about a year  which results in timet s cycle preceding that of the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
timet can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will result in demand for titanium products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded 
existing industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in diverse uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive and architectural uses 
several of these are emerging applications and represent potential growth opportunities that timet believes may reduce the industry s historical dependence on the aerospace market 
the business environment in which timet finds itself in remains very different from during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
during  aerospace customers continued to reduce inventories  and customers and end users continue to indicate that a substantial inventory overhang exists 
as a result  a significant number of timet s major aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
most importantly  timet believes orders under timet s long term contract with the boeing company boeing were significantly below the contractual volume requirements for although boeing has informed timet that it will either order the required contractual volume under the contract in or pay the liquidated damages provided for in the agreement  timet has received virtually no boeing related orders under the contract for the year boeing has also informed timet that it is unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year  and timet has filed a lawsuit against boeing for repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
these factors lead timet to believe that year sales will be somewhat lower than the fourth quarter annualized amount 
adding to the challenges in the aerospace sector  industrial demand for titanium remains soft due to the weakness in asian and other economies 
assuming overall market demand remains at currently expected levels  which is lower than  timet currently expects operating and net losses in each quarter of in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts referred to below are expected to cause sales  gross profit and operating income excluding special charges to be lower in than in in the fourth quarter of and january timet began implementing a plan of action designed to address current market conditions without abandoning key elements of its long term strategy  which it believes remain sound 
the action plan entails the following o timet s global manufacturing operations and commercial operations have been consolidated into two organizations with personnel reductions of about people compared to year end levels 
this comes on top of a reduction of approximately people during and o timet will focus significant efforts in improving manufacturing performance 
considerable resources will be devoted to continuous improvement programs to improve the quality of manufacturing  customer service and management processes 
o reductions in plant overhead costs as well as in selling and administrative costs have been targeted 
o supply contracts with key vendors have been renegotiated in order to reduce volumes and  to some extent  prices 
similar efforts will continue throughout o capital expenditures will be reduced from levels 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in  compared to approximately million in and an aggregate of approximately million in and in addition to its short term plan of actions as described above  timet has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company 
these agreements provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
the contracts were structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of timet s long term aerospace strategy 
these agreements should limit pricing volatility both up and down for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
the boeing contract requires boeing to purchase a minimum percentage of their titanium requirements from timet 
although boeing placed orders and accepted delivery of certain volumes in  timet believes the level of orders was significantly below the contractual volume requirements for although boeing has informed timet that it will either order the required contractual volume under the contract in or pay the liquidated damages provided for in the agreement  timet has received virtually no boeing related orders under the contract for the year boeing has also informed timet that it is unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year on march   timet filed a lawsuit against boeing in a colorado state court seeking damages for boeing s repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
timet s complaint seeks damages from boeing that timet believes are in excess of million and a declaration from the court of timet s rights under the contract 
as a complement to the long term agreements entered into with timet s key customers  timet has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that were intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for timet s key customers 
primarily because of the lack of boeing orders  the order flow did not meet expectations in  therefore  timet restructured the terms of certain agreements 
acquisitions and capital transactions during the past three years 
during  timet entered into a welded tube joint venture valtimet intended to combine best manufacturing practices and market coverage in this market 
in  timet i acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  particularly oil and gas  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe  ii purchased for cash million of non voting preferred securities of special metals corporation  a us manufacturer of wrought nickel based superalloys and special alloy long products  and iii entered into a castings joint venture with wyman gordon 
in january  timet sold its interest in the castings joint venture 
during the fourth quarter of  timet recorded a million charge to pretax earnings for the write down associated with timet s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
products and operations 
timet is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
in  virtually all of timet s sales were generated by timet s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
timet s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nevada  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
timet sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to timet s service centers 
timet s customers usually process timet s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of products  timet performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that timet s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
timet is dependent upon the services of outside processors to perform important processing functions with respect to certain of its products 
in particular  timet currently relies upon a single processor to perform certain rolling steps with respect to some of its plate  sheet and strip products 
although timet believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on timet s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
timet is exploring ways to lessen its dependence on any individual processor 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
timet processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
during  approximately of timet s production was made from internally produced sponge  from purchased sponge  from titanium scrap and from alloying elements 
while timet is one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a portion of its sponge needs in based upon timet s evaluation of the relative cost of raw materials and the technical requirements of its customers  timet expects the mix of raw materials in to be internally produced sponge  purchased sponge  scrap and alloying elements 
sponge producers in japan and kazakhstan are expected to supply all of timet s sponge purchases in timet has a long term agreement  concluded in  for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
this sponge purchase agreement is for ten years  with firm pricing for the first five years subject to certain possible adjustments 
this contract provides for annual purchases by timet of  to  metric tons 
the parties agreed to reduced minimums for and due to the decrease in demand for titanium  timet has abandoned its plans to purchase on a long term basis premium quality sponge produced in japan 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  africa south africa and sierra leone  india and the united states 
a majority of timet s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
timet believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which timet purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
in addition  although timet believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that timet will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single source near timet s plant  but alternative suppliers are available 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
timet facilities 
in addition to its us sponge capacity discussed below  timet s worldwide melting capacity in aggregates approximately  metric tons estimated of world capacity  and its mill products capacity aggregates approximately  metric tons estimated of world capacity 
approximately of timet s worldwide melting capacity is represented by electron beam cold hearth melting eb furnaces  by vacuum arc remelting var furnaces and by a vacuum induction melting vim furnace 
timet has operated its major production facilities at varying levels of practical capacity during the past three years 
in  the plants operated at of practical capacity  decreasing to in and a further reduction to in in  timet s plants are expected to operate at of practical capacity 
during  timet closed  metric tons of melting capacity by permanently shutting down facilities in verdi  nevada and millbury  massachusetts 
in  timet temporarily idled its kroll leach process sponge facility in nevada due to changing market conditions for certain grades of titanium sponge 
timet s vdp sponge facility in henderson  nevada is expected to operate at approximately of its annual practical capacity of  metric tons during  which approximates the level and down from approximately in vdp sponge is used principally as a raw material for timet s ingot melting facilities in the us during  timet expanded the use of vdp sponge to its european facilities and approximately metric tons of vdp production was used in europe  which represented approximately of the sponge consumed in timet s european operations 
timet expects the consumption of vdp sponge in its european operations to increase to one third of their sponge requirements in  which is expected to increase operating volumes and reduce manufacturing cost rates at the henderson  nevada facility 
due to changing market conditions for certain grades of sponge  timet s older kroll leach process sponge plant in nevada was temporarily idled at the end of march the raw materials processing facilities in morgantown primarily process scrap used as melting feedstock  either in combination with sponge or separately 
timet s us melting facilities in henderson  nevada  morgantown  pennsylvania and vallejo  california produce ingots and slabs both sold to customers and used as feedstock for its mill products operations 
these melting facilities are expected to operate at approximately of aggregate capacity in  with certain production facilities temporarily idled 
titanium mill products are principally produced at timet s forging and rolling facility in toronto  ohio  which receives titanium ingots and slabs from timet s us melting facilities 
timet s forging and rolling facilities are expected to operate at approximately of practical capacity in timet uk s melting facility in witton  england produces var ingots used primarily as feedstock for its forging operations  also in witton 
the forging operations process the ingots principally into billet product for sale to customers or into an intermediate for further processing into bar and plate at its facility in waunarlwydd  wales 
uk melting and mill products production in is expected to be approximately and  respectively  of capacity 
capacity of owned timet savoie in ugine  france is to a certain extent dependent upon the level of activity in cezus zirconium business  which may from time to time provide timet savoie with capacity in excess of that contractually required to be provided by cezus the minority partner in timet savoie 
during  timet savoie expects to operate at approximately of the maximum capacity required to be provided by cezus 
sponge for melting requirements in both the uk and france is purchased principally from suppliers in japan and kazakhstan  with approximately one third of timet s european requirements expected to be provided by timet s henderson  nevada vdp plant 
distribution 
timet sells its products through its own sales force based in the u 
s and europe  and through independent agents worldwide 
timet s marketing and distribution system also includes ten timet owned service centers six in the us and four in europe  which sell timet s products on a just in time basis 
timet believes that it has a competitive sales and cost advantage arising from the location of its production plants and service centers  which are in close proximity to major customers 
these centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products including bar and flat rolled sheet and strip 
timet believes its service centers give it a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
markets and customer base 
about of timet s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
while no customer accounts for more than of timet s direct sales in  about of timet s mill product sales were used by timet s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
timet has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  which accounted for approximately of aerospace sales in timet expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace sector  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft boeing commercial airplane group and the airbus consortium and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
timet s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use timet s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on timet 
timet s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during although timet believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect timet s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of through various strategic relationships  timet seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
timet has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
timet also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  former soviet union fsu and china 
timet is one of five integrated producers in the world  with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
timet believes that most producers will continue to generally operate at lower capacity utilization levels in than in  increasing price competition 
timet s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny technologies inc  rti international metals  inc 
and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
timet competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent timet has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on timet has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
the gsp program has been renewed for two years and is scheduled to expire during the second quarter in  gsp benefits to these products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine had for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
titanium sponge imports from japan were also subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision  and the briefing of the appeal was concluded in the third quarter of a decision is expected during and until such decision is reached  the orders remain revoked 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of timet 
however  timet has  in recent years  been one of the largest importers of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent timet remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to timet for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
timet believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
timet s research and development activities are directed toward improving process technology  developing new alloys  enhancing the performance of timet s products in current applications  and searching for new uses of titanium products 
for example  aerospace applications continue to grow for some of timet s proprietary alloys such as timetal r s and timetal additionally  testing of alloys such as timetal lcb and timetal is increasing for new non aerospace applications 
timet conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nevada laboratory  which timet believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton  england facility 
patents and trademarks 
timet holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
timet continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by timet do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
timet believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
the following table shows the significant reduction in the number of timet employees over the past years 
the reduction in employees from the peak in was in response to a reduction in market demand 
during  timet expects to reduce employment by an additional people  or approximately of timet s worldwide workforce 
the vast majority of the employee reductions are expected to occur during the first half of the year 
employees at december  us    europe  total    timet s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
negotiations with respect to the henderson contract are expected to begin during the third quarter of employees at timet s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
over of the salaried and hourly employees at timet s european facilities are represented by various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements  the majority of which are still under negotiation for timet expects to complete the negotiation of one year contracts in the uk and france that would include modest wage increases 
while timet currently considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect timet s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
timet s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the following federal acts the clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
timet uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at timet s henderson  nevada facility  timet uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
timet has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in timet s operations 
timet s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to timet s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
timet s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on timet 
timet believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws 
timet s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  timet may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties 
timet incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental compliance matters of approximately million in each of  and and its capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies environmental matters  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
unconsolidated affiliate nl nl files periodic reports with the commission pursuant to the exchange act  as amended 
the following information with respect to nl commission file number has been summarized from such reports  which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of nl 
general 
nl conducts its continuing operations through its principal wholly owned subsidiary  kronos  inc in january  the specialty chemicals business of rheox  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nl  was sold for million to elementis plc  including million attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business 
see item business unconsolidated affiliate nl discontinued operations rheox for related discussion 
kronos is the world s fourth largest producer of titanium dioxide pigments tio with an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume in approximately one half of kronos sales volume was in europe  where kronos is the second largest producer of tio nl s primary objective is to maximize total shareholder return 
nl has taken a number of steps towards achieving its objective  including i increasing its regular quarterly dividend to 
per share  ii controlling costs  iii investing in certain cost effective debottlenecking projects to increase tio production capacity and efficiency  and iv improving its capital structure 
nl periodically considers mergers or acquisitions within the chemical industry and acquisitions of additional tio production capacity to meet its objective 
industry 
titanium dioxide pigments are chemical products used for imparting whiteness  brightness and opacity to a wide range of products  including paints  plastics  paper  fibers and ceramics 
tio is considered a quality of life product with demand affected by gross domestic product in various regions of the world 
pricing within the global tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
nl s average tio selling prices on a billing currency basis decreased during the first three quarters of  before increasing in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of industry wide demand for tio increased in  with second half demand higher than first half demand as a result of  among other things  customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases 
kronos sales volume increased from its sales volume with growth in all major regions 
kronos expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  depending primarily upon global economic conditions 
prices at the end of the fourth quarter of were higher than the average for the quarter and nl expects to continue to phase in previously announced price increases during the first quarter of nl s expectations as to the future prospects of the tio industry and prices are based upon a number of factors beyond nl s control  including continued worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from nl s expectations  industry and nl s performance could be unfavorably affected 
kronos has an estimated share of european tio sales volume and an estimated share of north american tio sales volume 
per capita consumption of tio in the united states and western europe far exceeds that in other areas of the world and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of tio significant regions for tio consumption could emerge in eastern europe  the far east or china if the economies in these regions develop to the point that quality of life products  including tio  are in greater demand 
kronos believes that  due to its strong presence in western europe  it is well positioned to participate in growth in consumption of tio in eastern europe 
products and operations 
nl believes that there are no effective substitutes for tio however  extenders such as kaolin clays  calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used in a number of kronos markets 
generally  extenders are used to reduce to some extent the utilization of higher cost tio the use of extenders has not significantly changed tio consumption over the past decade because  to date  extenders generally have failed to match the performance characteristics of tio as a result  nl believes that the use of extenders will not materially alter the growth of the tio business in the foreseeable future 
kronos currently produces over different tio grades  sold under the kronos and titanox trademarks  which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers specific requirements 
kronos major customers include domestic and international paint  plastics and paper manufacturers 
kronos is one of the world s leading producers and marketers of tio kronos and its distributors and agents sell and provide technical services for its products to over  customers with the majority of sales in europe and north america 
kronos international operations are conducted through kronos international  inc  a germany based holding company formed in to manage and coordinate nl s manufacturing operations in germany  canada  belgium and norway  and its sales and marketing activities in over countries worldwide 
kronos and its predecessors have produced and marketed tio in north america and europe for years 
as a result  kronos believes that it has developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture  sale  shipment and service of its products in domestic and international markets 
by volume  approximately one half of kronos tio sales were to europe  with to north america and the balance to export markets 
kronos is also engaged in the mining and sale of ilmenite ore a raw material used in the sulfate pigment production process described below and has estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least years 
kronos is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of iron based water treatment chemicals derived from co products of the pigment production processes 
water treatment chemicals are used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater  and in the manufacture of iron pigments 
manufacturing process and raw materials 
tio is manufactured by kronos using both the chloride process and the sulfate process 
approximately two thirds of kronos current production capacity is based on its chloride process which generates less waste than the sulfate process 
although most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  chloride process pigments are generally preferred in certain coatings and plastics applications  and sulfate process pigments are generally preferred for certain paper  fibers and ceramics applications 
due to environmental factors and customer considerations  the proportion of tio industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments and  in  chloride process production facilities represented almost of industry capacity 
kronos produced  metric tons of tio in  compared to a record  metric tons produced in and  metric tons in kronos average production capacity utilization rate in was  down from full capacity in  primarily due to nl s decision to manage inventory levels by curtailing production volume during the first quarter of kronos believes its current annual attainable production capacity is approximately  metric tons  including its one half interest in the joint venture owned louisiana plant see item business unconsolidated affiliate nl tio manufacturing joint venture 
the primary raw materials used in the tio chloride production process are chlorine  coke and titanium containing feedstock derived from beach sand ilmenite and natural rutile ore 
chlorine and coke are available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally in australia  south africa  canada  india and the united states 
kronos purchases slag refined from beach sand ilmenite from richards bay iron and titanium proprietary limited south africa under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of natural rutile ore  another chloride feedstock  is purchased primarily from iluka resources  inc formerly rgc mineral sands limited australia  a wholly owned subsidiary of westralian sands limited australia  under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of nl does not expect to encounter difficulties obtaining long term extensions to existing supply contracts prior to the expiration of the contracts 
raw materials purchased under these contracts and extensions thereof are expected to meet kronos chloride feedstock requirements over the next several years 
the primary raw materials used in the tio sulfate production process are sulfuric acid and titanium containing feedstock derived primarily from rock and beach sand ilmenite 
sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
currently  the principal active sources are located in norway  canada  australia  india and south africa 
as one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process pigments  kronos operates a rock ilmenite mine in norway  which provided all of kronos feedstock for its european sulfate process pigment plants in for its canadian plant  kronos also purchases sulfate grade slag from rio tinto iron and titanium  inc formerly qit fer et titane inc 
under a long term supply contract which expires in kronos believes the availability of titanium containing feedstock for both the chloride and sulfate processes is adequate for the next several years 
kronos does not expect to experience any interruptions of its raw material supplies because of its long term supply contracts 
however  political and economic instability in certain countries from which nl purchases its raw material supplies could adversely affect the availability of such feedstock 
tio manufacturing joint venture 
subsidiaries of kronos and huntsman ici holdings hici each own a interest in a manufacturing joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc 
lpc owns and operates a chloride process tio plant located in lake charles  louisiana 
production from the plant is shared equally by kronos and hici the partners pursuant to separate offtake agreements 
a supervisory committee  composed of four members  two of whom are appointed by each partner  directs the business and affairs of lpc including production and output decisions 
two general managers  one appointed and compensated by each partner  manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee 
the manufacturing joint venture operates on a break even basis and  accordingly  kronos transfer price for its share of tio produced is equal to its share of the joint venture s production costs and interest expense  if any 
kronos share of the production costs are reported as cost of sales as the related tio acquired from the joint venture is sold  and its share of the joint venture s interest expense  if any  is reported as a component of interest expense 
competition 
the tio industry is highly competitive 
during the early s  supply of tio exceeded demand  primarily due to new chloride process capacity coming on stream  which suppressed selling prices 
prices improved in the mid s with a peak in the first half of prices declined until the first quarter of  when selling prices of tio began to increase as a result of increased demand  peaking in the fourth quarter of kronos average selling price in was lower than pigment prices declined during the first three quarters of  but increased in the fourth quarter as a result of price increases announced by all major producers effective during the fourth quarter 
such price increases began to be phased in during the fourth quarter of and continue to be implemented in the first quarter of kronos recently announced a price increase in europe effective april  the successful implementation of the price increase will depend on market conditions 
should demand in remain strong  additional price increases could be announced later in no assurance can be given that demand or price trends will conform to nl s expectations 
see item business unconsolidated affiliate nl industry for a description of certain risks and uncertainties affecting the tio industry 
kronos worldwide sales volume in the first half of was lower than the first half of the previous year 
demand in the second half of was stronger than comparable periods in both and although a portion of the increased demand may be attributed to customers buying in advance of announced price increases 
kronos total worldwide sales volume was higher than kronos expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from the strong overall performance of  but this will depend upon  among other things  global economic conditions 
kronos competes primarily on the basis of price  product quality and technical service  and the availability of high performance pigment grades 
although certain tio grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of kronos grades and substantially all of kronos production are considered commodity pigments with price generally being the most significant competitive factor 
during kronos had an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume  and kronos believes that it is the leading seller of tio in a number of countries  including germany and canada 
kronos principal competitors are ei du pont de nemours co 
dupont  millennium chemicals  inc  hici  kerr mcgee corporation  kemira oy  and ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
kronos six largest competitors have estimated individual shares of tio production capacity ranging from to  and an estimated aggregate share of worldwide tio production volume 
dupont has about one half of total us tio production capacity and is kronos principal north american competitor 
effective june   imperial chemicals industries plc ici sold its titanium dioxide business  including its ownership interest in lpc  to hici  a newly formed company that is owned by huntsman corporation and owned by ici 
in february kerr mcgee announced an agreement to acquire kemira s tio business in the netherlands and the us if this acquisition is completed  kronos would become the world s fifth largest producer of tio capacity additions that are the result of construction of greenfield plants in the worldwide tio market require significant capital and substantial lead time  typically three to five years in nl s experience 
no greenfield plants have been announced  but industry capacity can be expected to increase as kronos and its competitors debottleneck existing plants 
based on the factors described under the caption industry above  nl expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for tio during the next three to five years 
discontinued operations rheox 
on january   nl sold its rheox specialty chemicals business to elementis plc for million  including million attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business 
as a result of the sale  nl has reported its rheox operation as discontinued operations 
the majority of the million after tax proceeds has been used to reduce nl s outstanding indebtedness 
research and development 
nl s expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs  excluding discontinued operations  have averaged approximately million annually during the past three years 
research and development activities are conducted principally at the leverkusen  germany facility 
such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes  improving product quality and strengthening kronos competitive position by developing new pigment applications 
patents and trademarks 
patents held for products and production processes are believed to be important to nl and to the continuing business activities of kronos 
nl continually seeks patent protection for its technical developments  principally in the united states  canada and europe  and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties 
nl s major trademarks  including kronos and titanox  are protected by registration in the united states and elsewhere with respect to those products it manufactures and sells 
foreign operations 
nl s chemical businesses have operated in non us markets since the s 
most of kronos current production capacity is located in europe and canada 
kronos european operations include facilities in germany  belgium and norway 
approximately three quarters of nl s consolidated sales were to non us customers  including to customers in areas other than europe and canada 
foreign operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations and nl s results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on nl s results of operations are discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations nl industries and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk nl industries 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which nl operates may expose it to risk of loss 
nl does not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
nl cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on its operations 
nl s manufacturing and mining operations are also subject to extensive and diverse environmental regulation in each of the foreign countries in which they operate 
see regulatory and environmental matters below 
customer base and seasonality 
nl believes that neither its aggregate sales nor those of any of its principal product groups are concentrated in or materially dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers 
neither nl s business as a whole nor that of any of its principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent 
due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet the spring and summer painting season demand  tio sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
nl facilities 
kronos currently operates four tio facilities in europe leverkusen and nordenham  germany  langerbrugge  belgium  and fredrikstad  norway 
in north america  kronos has a facility in varennes  quebec  canada and  through the manufacturing joint venture described above  a one half interest in a plant in lake charles  louisiana 
nl also owns a slurry plant in lake charles  louisiana 
nl s fredrikstad tio plant has a lien on it that secures a claim by norwegian tax authorities  pending resolution of certain tax litigation 
kronos principal german operating subsidiary leases the land under its leverkusen tio production facility pursuant to a lease expiring in the leverkusen facility  with about one third of kronos current tio production capacity  is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by bayer ag 
kronos is the only unrelated party so situated 
under a separate supplies and services agreement expiring in  bayer provides some raw materials  auxiliary and operating materials and utilities services necessary to operate the leverkusen facility 
both the lease and the supplies and services agreement restrict kronos ability to transfer ownership or use of the leverkusen facility 
all of kronos principal production facilities described above are owned  except for the land under the leverkusen facility 
kronos has a governmental concession with an unlimited term to operate its ilmenite mine in norway 
employees 
as of december   nl employed approximately  persons  excluding the joint venture employees  with approximately employees in the united states and approximately  at sites outside the united states 
hourly employees in production facilities worldwide  including the tio manufacturing joint venture  are represented by a variety of labor unions  with labor agreements having various expiration dates 
nl believes its labor relations are good 
regulatory and environmental matters 
certain of nl s businesses are and have been engaged in the handling  manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  certain past and current operations and products of nl have the potential to cause environmental or other damage 
nl has implemented and continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks 
the policy of nl is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all its facilities and to strive to improve its environmental performance 
it is possible that future developments  such as stricter requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  could adversely affect nl s production  handling  use  storage  transportation  sale or disposal of such substances as well as nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s us manufacturing operations are governed by federal environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations  principally the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla  as well as the state counterparts of these statutes 
nl believes the louisiana plant owned and operated by the joint venture and a slurry facility owned by nl are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of these laws or compliance orders issued thereunder 
nl has no other us plants 
from time to time  nl s facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under such statutes 
resolution of such matters typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution may result in the payment of penalties  but to date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s european and canadian production facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which governmental authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers which allow them to issue operating permits required for the plants to operate 
nl believes that all its plants are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
while the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in europe vary from country to country  a common regulatory denominator is provided by the european union the eu 
germany and belgium are members of the eu and follow its initiatives 
norway  although not a member  generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the eu 
nl believes that kronos is in substantial compliance with agreements reached with european regulatory authorities and with an eu directive to control the effluents produced by tio production facilities 
nl has a contract with a third party to treat certain of its leverkusen and nordenham  germany sulfate process effluents 
either party may terminate the contract after giving four years advance notice with regard to the nordenham plant 
under certain circumstances  kronos may terminate the contract after giving six months notice with respect to treatment of effluents from the leverkusen plant 
nl expects to complete in an million landfill expansion for its belgian plant which will provide the plant with twenty years of storage space for neutralized chloride process solids 
in order to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere consistent with applicable environmental regulations  kronos completed the installation of off gas desulfurization systems in at its norwegian and german plants at a cost of million 
nl s capital expenditures related to its ongoing environmental protection and improvement programs are currently expected to be approximately million in and million in nl has been named as a defendant  potentially responsible party prp  or both  pursuant to cercla and similar state laws in approximately governmental and private actions associated with waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  or its subsidiaries  or their predecessors  certain of which are on the us environmental protection agency s us epa superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
these proceedings seek cleanup costs  damages for personal injury or property damage  and or damages for injury to natural resources 
certain of these proceedings involve claims for substantial amounts 
although nl may be jointly and severally liable for such costs  in most cases it is only one of a number of prps who may also be jointly and severally liable 
the extent of cercla liability cannot accurately be determined until the remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs is complete  the us epa issues a record of decision and costs are allocated among prps 
the extent of liability under analogous state cleanup statutes and for common law equivalents are subject to similar uncertainties 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs for cercla matters and other environmental liabilities 
at december   nl had accrued million for those environmental matters which are reasonably estimable 
nl determines the amount of accrual on a quarterly basis by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs to nl 
such costs include  among other things  expenditures for remedial investigations  monitoring  managing  studies  certain legal fees  cleanup  removal and remediation 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
nl has estimated that the upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to nl for sites for which it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million 
nl s estimate of such liability has not been discounted to present value and nl has not recognized any potential insurance recoveries 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed either accrued amounts or the upper end of the range for sites for which estimates have been made  and no assurance can be given that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no estimate presently can be made 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes with respect to site cleanup costs or allocation of such costs among prps  or a determination that nl is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated by nl to be required for such matters 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future 
more detailed descriptions of certain legal proceedings relating to environmental matters are set forth below 
in july the united states filed an action in the us district court for the southern district of illinois against nl and others united states of america v 
nl industries  inc  et al  civ 
no 
cv with respect to the granite city  illinois lead smelter formerly owned by nl 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief to compel the defendants to comply with an administrative order issued pursuant to cercla  and fines and treble damages for the alleged failure to comply with the order 
nl and the other parties did not implement the order  believing that the remedy selected by the us epa was invalid  arbitrary  capricious and was not selected in accordance with law 
the complaint also seeks recovery of past costs and a declaration that the defendants are liable for future costs 
although the action was filed against nl and ten other defendants  there are other prps who have been notified by the us epa 
some of those notified were also respondents to the administrative order 
in february the court entered a case management order directing that the remedy issues be tried before the liability aspects are presented 
in september the us epa released its amended decision selecting cleanup remedies for the granite city site 
nl presently is challenging portions of the us epa s selection of the remedy 
in september the us epa informed nl that past and future cleanup costs are estimated to total approximately million

in nl and other prps entered into an administrative consent order with the us epa requiring the performance of a rifs at two subsites in cherokee county  kansas  where nl and others formerly mined lead and zinc 
a former subsidiary of nl mined at the baxter springs subsite  where it is the largest viable prp 
in august the us epa issued the record of decision for the baxter springs and treece subsites 
the us epa has estimated that the selected remedy will cost an aggregate of approximately million for both subsites million for the baxter springs subsite 
in nl entered into a consent decree with the us epa resolving its liability at the baxter springs subsite  and has reached an agreement in principle with the other prps with respect to allocation of site costs 
in addition  nl and other prps are performing an investigation in four additional subsites in cherokee county 
in the us epa ordered nl to perform a removal action at a formerly owned facility in chicago  illinois 
nl is complying with the order and has completed the on site work at the facility 
offsite contamination is being investigated 
residents in the vicinity of nl s former philadelphia lead chemicals plant commenced a class action allegedly comprised of over  individuals seeking medical monitoring and damages allegedly caused by emissions from the plant 
wagner  et al 
v 
anzon  inc and nl industries  inc  no 
 court of common pleas  philadelphia county 
the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages from nl and the current owner of the plant  and alleged causes of action for  among other things  negligence  strict liability  and nuisance 
a class was certified to include persons who resided  owned or rented property  or who work or have worked within up to approximately three quarters of a mile from the plant from through the present 
nl answered the complaint  denying liability 
in december the jury returned a verdict in favor of nl 
plaintiffs appealed to the pennsylvania superior court and in september the superior court affirmed the judgment in favor of nl 
in december plaintiffs filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court  which was declined 
residents also filed consolidated actions in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  shinozaki v 
anzon  inc and wagner and antczak v

nos 
  and the consolidated action is a putative class action seeking cercla response costs  including cleanup and medical monitoring  declaratory and injunctive relief and civil penalties for alleged violations of the rcra  and also asserting pendent common law claims for strict liability  trespass  nuisance and punitive damages 
the court dismissed the common law claims without prejudice  dismissed two of the three rcra claims as against nl with prejudice  and stayed the case pending the outcome of the state court litigation 
at a municipal and industrial waste disposal site in batavia  new york  nl and approximately others have been identified as prps 
the us epa has divided the site into two operable units 
pursuant to an administrative consent order entered into with the us epa  nl conducted a rifs for operable unit one  the closure of the industrial waste disposal section of the landfill 
nl s rifs costs were approximately million 
in june the us epa issued the record of decision for operable unit one  which is estimated by the us epa to cost approximately million 
in september the us epa and certain prps entered into an administrative order on consent for the remedial design phase of the remedy for operable unit one and the design phase is proceeding 
nl and other prps entered into an interim cost sharing arrangement for this phase of work 
nl and the other prps have completed the work comprising operable unit two the extension of the municipal water supply with the exception of annual operation and maintenance 
the us epa alleges it has incurred approximately million in past costs 
nl and other prps have concluded a nonbinding allocation process  as a result of which nl was assigned of future site costs 
nl and other prps currently are negotiating a consent decree based on this allocation 
lead pigment litigation 
nl was formerly involved in the manufacture of lead based paint and lead pigments for use in paint 
nl has been named as a defendant or third party defendant in various legal proceedings alleging that nl and other manufacturers are responsible for personal injury  property damage and government expenditures allegedly associated with the use of lead pigments 
nl is vigorously defending such litigation 
considering nl s previous involvement in the lead pigment and lead based paint businesses  there can be no assurance that additional litigation  similar to that described below  will not be filed 
in addition  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been enacted or proposed that seek to a impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and b effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date which are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  the imposition of market share liability or other legislation could have such an effect 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
in june a complaint was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  against the pigment manufacturers and the lead industries association lia 
plaintiffs seek damages  contribution and or indemnity in an amount in excess of million for monitoring and abating alleged lead paint hazards in public and private residential buildings  diagnosing and treating children allegedly exposed to lead paint in city buildings  the costs of educating city residents to the hazards of lead paint  and liability in personal injury actions against the city and the housing authority based on alleged lead poisoning of city residents the city of new york  the new york city housing authority and the new york city health and hospitals corp 
v 
lead industries association  inc  et al  no 

in december the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss claims alleging negligence and strict liability and denied the remainder of the motion 
in january defendants appealed the denial 
in may the appellate division of the supreme court affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss plaintiffs fraud  restitution and indemnification claims 
in may the trial court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs restitution and indemnification claims  and plaintiffs appealed

 hls district court of new jersey 
the action relating to lead pigment litigation defense costs filed in may against commercial union insurance company commercial union seeks to recover defense costs incurred in the city of new york lead pigment case and two other cases which have since been resolved in nl s favor 
in july the court granted nl s motion for summary judgment and ordered commercial union to pay nl s reasonable defense costs for such cases 
in june nl filed an amended complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against commercial union seeking to recover costs incurred in defending four additional lead pigment cases which have since been resolved in nl s favor 
in august the court granted nl s motion for summary judgment and ordered commercial union to pay the reasonable costs of defending those cases 
in july the court entered judgment on the order requiring commercial union to pay previously incurred nl costs in defending those cases 
in september the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed and remanded for further consideration the decision by the trial court that commercial union was obligated to pay nl s reasonable defense costs in certain of the lead pigment cases 
the trial court had made its decision applying new jersey law  the appeals court concluded that new york and not new jersey law applied and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination under new york law 
on remand from the court of appeals  the trial court in april granted nl s motion for summary judgment  finding that commercial union had a duty to defend nl in the four lead paint cases which were the subject of nl s second amended complaint 
the court also issued a partial ruling on commercial union s motion for summary judgment in which it sought allocation of defense costs and contribution from nl and two other insurance carriers in connection with the three lead paint actions on which the court had granted nl summary judgment in the court ruled that commercial union is entitled to receive such contribution from nl and the two carriers  but reserved ruling with respect to the relative contributions to be made by each of the parties  including contributions by nl that may be required with respect to periods in which it was self insured and contributions from one carrier which were reinsured by a former subsidiary of nl  the reinsurance costs of which nl may ultimately be required to bear 
in june nl reached a settlement in principle with its insurers regarding allocation of defense costs in the lead pigment cases in which reimbursement of defense costs had been sought 
other than granting motions for summary judgment brought by two excess liability insurance carriers  which contended that their policies contained absolute pollution exclusion language  and certain summary judgment motions regarding policy periods and ruling regarding choice of law issues  the court has not made any final rulings on defense costs or indemnity coverage with respect to nl s pending environmental litigation 
nor has the court made any final ruling on indemnity coverage in the lead pigment litigation 
no trial dates have been set 
other than rulings to date  the issue of whether insurance coverage for defense costs or indemnity or both will be found to exist depends upon a variety of factors  and there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will exist in other cases 
nl has not considered any potential insurance recoveries for lead pigment or environmental litigation in determining related accruals

regulatory and environmental matters regulatory and environmental matters for timet and nl are discussed in their respective business sections contained elsewhere herein and in item legal proceedings 
in addition  the information included in note to the consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference 
in  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the arkansas division of pollution control and ecology in connection with certain alleged water discharge permit violations at one of several abandoned barite mining sites in arkansas 
the settlement agreement  in addition to requiring the payment in of a  penalty  required the company to undertake a remediation reclamation program which has been completed at a total cost of approximately million 
this site is now subject only to ongoing monitoring and maintenance obligations 
another of the sites is currently being evaluated by the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq 
the company  along with two other identified potentially responsible parties  has entered into discussions with adeq that are expected to result in one or more voluntary settlement agreements pertaining to investigations and remedial actions to be undertaken at this site 
the company believes that to the extent it has any additional liability for remediation at this site  it is only one of a number of apparently solvent potentially responsible parties that would ultimately share in any such costs 
as of december   the company had accrued approximately million related to these matters 
the company records liabilities related to environmental remediation obligations when estimated future expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by the company at its non operating facilities  or a determination that the company is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites  could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known or where no estimate can presently be made 
further  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future

the results of operations of timet and nl  and the company s equity therein  are discussed below 
equity in earnings of other joint ventures consist principally of real estate development earnings of landwell  which can fluctuate from period to period 
corporate expenses  net 
tremont s corporate expenses  net for consist primarily of expenses related to intercorporate service agreements and opeb 
tremont s corporate expenses  net for include expenses related to intercorporate service agreements and opeb primarily offset by million of interest earned on short term investments and a 
million gain for cash received related to an investment that had previously been written off 
corporate expenses  net for  include million of interest earned on short term investments and a million gain on the sale of a certain oil and gas production well interest 
interest expense 
interest expense was higher in due to higher average borrowings under the advance agreement with contran  which agreement was entered into in october see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects interest expense in to be comparable to due to slightly lower borrowing levels offset by higher interest rates 
income taxes 
the company s income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate principally due to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to the recognition of a deductible difference associated with affiliates not included in the consolidated tax group that previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the variance in rates in was due to a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to a net decrease in the basis differences related to the company s investment in nl 
the variance in rates in was principally due to no tax benefit being recognizable on equity in losses from its investment in nl 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed below  the company expects to report equity in losses of timet in the company s effective income tax rate in is expected to vary from the us statutory rate because tremont does not expect that recognizing a deferred income tax asset with respect to such equity in losses will be appropriate under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
other 
tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  principally its investments in nl and timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a writedown which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
the company s per share net carrying amount of its investment in nl at december  was per share  compared to a per share market price of at that date 
at december   after considering what the company believes to be all relevant factors including  among other things  timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  the company recorded a million pre tax non cash charge million net of tax to earnings to reduce the net carrying value of its investment in timet for an other than temporary impairment in its market value 
after such writedown  at december   the company s net carrying value of its investment in timet was per share compared to a per share market price of at that date 
in determining the amount of the impairment charge  the company considered  among other things  recent ranges of timet s stock price and current estimate of timet s future operating losses which would further reduce the company s net carrying value of its investment in timet as it records additional equity in losses 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate its interests in nl and timet based upon  among other things  their respective results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and business outlook 
in the event tremont determines that any further decline in value of its interests below their net carrying value has occurred which is other than temporary  it would report an appropriate writedown at that time 
year yk 
tremont  as a holding company  does not itself have numerous applications or systems 
during  the company completed an assessment of potential yk issues in its information systems and implemented remedial actions as necessary 
the cost to the company for yk readiness was not material 
the company did not experience any significant adverse effects on its systems or operations as a result of the yk issues 
yk issues related to timet and nl are discussed below 
timet the company s equity in timet s earnings losses differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s december  ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of timet and because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in timet 
amortization of such basis differences in timet other than with respect to the other than temporary impairment charge discussed above generally increases earnings  and decreases losses  attributable to timet as reported by tremont 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of timet has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by timet file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning timet  including complete financial statements 
general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately three fourths of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
during the second half of  it became evident to timet that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
during  aerospace customers reduced inventories and adjusted to decreases in overall production rates and  as a result  timet s mill products shipments declined to  metric tons 
timet s fourth quarter sales of million was the lowest quarterly sales amount in four years 
at present  a substantial inventory overhang still exists throughout the aerospace industry supply chain and current expectations are that sales will be somewhat below the fourth quarter annualized due to lower expected sales volumes and selling prices 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies and is expected to remain soft during timet estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons and decreased in to approximately  metric tons and decreased a further in to  metric tons 
expectations for are a further decline in mill product shipments although the decline is expected to be less than that experienced during each of the last two years 
timet s order backlog decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during timet expects that production levels  capacity utilization  sales volumes  sales prices  gross margins and operating income excluding special charges  will all be lower in than they were in accordingly  timet currently expects that its loss before special charges will exceed its loss before special charges and looks to return to profitability in late in january  timet adopted a plan to restructure the organization and reduce costs 
as part of this reorganization  the global manufacturing and commercial operations have been consolidated into two organizations  and timet will further reduce personnel by about  or employees  primarily during the first half of additional resources will be focused in an effort to significantly improve the quality of timet s manufacturing  customer service and management processes to return to profitability 
the restructuring actions taken in january are expected to result in an additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of of up to million  primarily related to employee termination costs 
additionally  in february  timet entered into new us and us credit facilities 
in connection therewith  timet wrote off million of deferred financing costs associated with its previous us facility 
timet has implemented plans to address the current market conditions  as more fully described in item business unconsolidated affiliate timet current industry conditions and outlook for restructuring charges in and as a result of timet s action plans were million and million  respectively 
the components of the and restructuring charges are summarized below 
segment segment melted and melted and mill mill products other products other in millions property and equipment 
disposition of german subsidiary pension and opeb costs  net 
personnel severance and benefits 
other exit costs  principally related to leased facilities 
summarized statement of operations information of timet is presented below 
years ended december  in millions net sales titanium melted and mill products other eliminations operating income titanium melted and mill products other dividends and interest income general corporate income expense  net 
interest expense pretax income loss income tax expense benefit minority interest convertible preferred securities other minority interest net income loss tremont s equity in timet s income loss  including amortization of basis differences provision for market value decline note mill product shipments volume metric tons    average price per kilogram timet operates in two segments i titanium melted and mill products  its principal segment  and ii other 
in and  the other segment consisted primarily of timet s titanium castings operations which were combined in a joint venture during and subsequently sold in january in  the other segment consists of timet s nonintegrated joint ventures 
sales and operating income loss compared with the titanium melted and mill product segment net sales in decreased compared to primarily due to a decrease in mill products shipment volume resulting primarily from reduced demand in the aerospace market  as described above 
average selling prices for were approximately lower than reflecting both the price effect of long term agreements and increased price competition on non contract business 
average prices on shipments are expected to be as much as lower than average in certain product lines  but only slightly lower than average prices in the fourth quarter of timet produced approximately million of titanium ingot in  for which the customer was billed but income recognition was deferred 
timet anticipates the majority of this ingot will be converted and shipped in  at which time the related income will be recorded 
the decrease in net sales of the other segment is a result of timet s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is a result of the lower selling prices  lower production volumes  higher depreciation  and increased reserves for slow moving inventory 
yield  rework and deviated material costs were also higher and plant operating rates were lower 
selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were lower than in dollar terms due in large part to the completion of the implementation of the initial phase of timet s business enterprise system during the first half of these costs as a percentage of sales  however  increased to approximately primarily due to the decline in sales 
in the fourth quarter of  timet recorded million of special charges consisting of million of restructuring charges and million of write downs associated with timet s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
during the same quarter  timet also recorded a million charge to cost of sales for slow moving inventory 
approximately half of the restructuring charges were non cash  primarily related to the disposition of a germany subsidiary  with the cash component relating to the termination of people 
the million charge for slow moving inventory and million of the million of special charges are included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million 
operating losses of the other segment included million and million of special charges in and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet 
equity in losses of the other segment were higher in due to timet recording a higher share of the losses for a full year in as a result of increased ownership in certain of these ventures in mid sales and operating income compared with net sales of the titanium melted and mill products segment in were below levels primarily due to lower volumes from reduced demand during the last half of the year in both aerospace and industrial markets  as described above 
mill product shipment volume for the year declined to  metric tons 
selling prices on shipments were relatively flat  in large part due to prices on orders entered prior to the decline in demand 
net sales of the other segment were down primarily as a result of timet s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july total cost of sales was of sales in  comparable to of sales in selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were higher than in  in both total dollar and percent of sales terms  up from  in large part due to information technology costs  including implementation of timet s business enterprise information system and addressing yk issues 
equity in earnings of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment improved in over principally due to improved earnings of valtimet 
equity losses of the other segment were higher in as certain ventures were held for the full year  compared to a part year in european operations 
timet has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing timet s us and european operations are substantially the same 
approximately of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and european currencies tied to the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for timet s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of timet s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of timet s european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
timet s export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and as such are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the us dollar sales and purchases of timet s european operations described above provide some natural hedge of non functional currencies  and timet does not use currency contracts to hedge its currency exposures 
net currency transaction gains losses included in earnings was a million loss in  a 
million gain in and nominal in at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of u 
s 
dollar cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and borrowings 
exchange rates among european currencies including the french franc  italian lira and german mark  but excluding the british pound became fixed relative to each other as a result of the implementaion of the euro effective in costs associated with modifications of systems to handle euro denominated transactions were not significant 
dividends and interest income 
in  dividends and interest income consists principally of accrued dividends on million of non voting preferred securities of special metals corporation  which were purchased by timet in october in and  the amount represents primarily earnings on corporate cash equivalents and varies with cash levels and interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources timet financing activities 
general corporate income expense 
general corporate income expense consists principally of currency transaction gains losses 
interest expense 
interest expense for more than doubled from the levels of primarily due to higher levels of average debt and increased interest rates 
also contributing to the higher comparative interest expense is a lower level of interest being capitalized in compared to as major capital projects have been completed 
while average borrowing levels increased in over  interest rates declined and interest capitalized increased 
interest expense in is expected to be higher than due to higher average borrowing levels and higher interest rates on the new credit facilities 
minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by compagnie europeene du zirconium cezus  sa cezus 
income taxes 
timet operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income loss can impact timet s overall effective tax rate 
in  timet s income tax rate also varied from the us statutory rate due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes 
for financial reporting purposes  timet has recognized the tax benefit of all of its net operating loss carryforwards  and expects that tax benefits to be recognized during will be deferred 
year yk 
as a result of many computer systems and applications being written to use two digit fields to designate a year  many date sensitive systems may have recognized the year as  or not at all 
this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing systems to incorrectly process critical financial  manufacturing and operational information 
these are generally referred to as the yk issues 
during  timet  with the help of outside specialists and consultants  completed all yk readiness procedures and did not experience any significant adverse effects on its systems or operations as a result of the yk issues 
these readiness procedures included i an initial assessment of potential yk issues in its non information systems eg  its manufacturing and communication systems  as well as in those information systems that were not replaced by the new business enterprise system  ii determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii developing contingency plans in the event internal or external yk issues were not resolved by the target date for completion 
timet expended in the aggregate approximately million in million in on these specific non information system yk issues  principally embedded system technology 
additionally  most of timet s information systems have been replaced in connection with the implementation of timet s business enterprise system  the initial implementation of which was substantially completed with the rollout of the system to the uk sites in the cost of the new system  including related equipment and networks  aggregated approximately million in million capital  million expense  of which million million capital  million expense was expended in to date in  none of timet s manufacturing facilities have suffered any downtime due to noncompliant systems  nor have any significant problems associated with the yk issues been identified in any systems 
timet will continue to monitor its major systems in order to ensure that such systems continue to be year compliant 
however  based primarily upon success to date  timet does not currently expect any significant yk issues will develop for any of its systems 
furthermore  timet is not aware of any significant adverse yk issues that may have arisen for its key suppliers or customers 
nl industries the company s interest in nl is reported by the equity method 
valhi and tremont together may be deemed to control nl 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of nl has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by nl file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning nl  including complete financial statements on nl s historical basis of accounting 
tremont s equity in earnings of nl differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to nl s separately reported earnings because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of nl in and the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in nl 
amortization of such basis differences generally reduces earnings  and increases losses  attributable to nl as reported by tremont 
nl s continuing operations are conducted by kronos in the tio business segment 
as discussed below  average tio selling prices significantly increased in and slightly decreased in compared to the prior year 
kronos operating income increased million in and declined million in gross profit margins were in  in and in many factors influence tio pricing levels  including industry capacity  worldwide demand growth and customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions

kronos operating income for was higher than due to higher average tio selling prices  partially offset by lower sales volume and million of income from refunds of german trade capital taxes  discussed below 
in billing currency terms  kronos average tio selling prices were lower than in with higher prices in north america offset by lower prices in europe and export markets 
european prices at the end of the year when expressed in us dollars at year end exchange rates were below prices available in the us as a result of the strong us dollar against major european currencies 
pigment prices declined during the first three quarters of  but increased in the fourth quarter as a result of price increases announced by all major producers effective during the fourth quarter 
such price increases began to be phased in during the fourth quarter of and continue to be implemented in the first quarter of kronos recently announced a price increase in europe effective april  the successful implementation of the price increase will depend on market conditions 
average selling prices in the fourth quarter of were lower than the fourth quarter of  lower than the average selling price for full year and higher than the third quarter of selling prices at the end of the fourth quarter were higher than the average for the quarter 
average tio selling prices in were higher than with strong increases in all major regions 
industry wide demand was strong throughout and the first half of  before moderating in the second half of and early demand in the second half of was stronger than comparable periods in both and as a result of  among other things  customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases 
kronos sales volume in the fourth quarter of increased from the fourth quarter of sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was higher than with growth in all major regions 
sales volume in was lower than  reflecting lower sales in asia and latin america 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  and the balance to other regions 
kronos expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  depending primarily upon global economic conditions  and accordingly  nl believes sales volume will approximate levels 
kronos produced at or near full capacity in and  but curtailed production during the first quarter of to manage inventory levels 
as a result  kronos reduced finished goods inventories by approximately  metric tons 
kronos production volume in was lower than and capacity utilization in was compared to full capacity in kronos production volume in is expected to closely match expected sales volume 
kronos believes average tio selling prices in should continue an upward trend as nl expects to continue to phase in announced price increases during should demand in remain strong  additional price increases could be announced later in nl believes that average prices will exceed average prices 
as a result of anticipated higher average prices and its continued focus on controlling costs  kronos expects its operating income will be higher than the extent of this improvement will be determined primarily by the magnitude of realized price increases 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which decreased nl s expenses in both and  kronos cost of sales in was higher than due to higher sales volume and higher unit costs  which resulted primarily from lower production levels 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than primarily due to lower sales volume 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of lower average selling prices and higher unit costs  and decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of increased average selling prices 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which decreased nl s expenses in both and  kronos selling  general and administrative expenses  in absolute dollar amounts  increased in from the previous year due to higher distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes  while expenses  in absolute dollar amounts  were lower than as a result of lower distribution expenses related to lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in and in both and the million of german trade capital tax refunds received in relates to years prior to and includes interest 
the german tax authorities were required to remit refunds based on i court decisions which reduced the trade capital tax base and ii prior agreements between nl and the german tax authorities regarding payment of disputed taxes 
nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the us dollar translated value of nl s foreign sales and operating costs is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses 
a significant amount of nl s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
excluding the million gain described above  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted nl s operating expenses and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income comparisons was not significant in or general corporate 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding general corporate income expense 
years ended december  change in millions securities earnings corporate expenses  net interest expense securities earnings fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
average funds invested in were lower than primarily due to the repayment of certain of nl s debt in the last half of average funds invested in were higher than primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of rheox in january nl expects security earnings in will be lower than due to lower average levels of funds available for investment due to debt reduction made during and higher projected expenditures in for dividends  environmental remediation and other corporate purposes 
corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to million of expenses in related to the unsuccessful acquisition of certain tio businesses and assets of a competitor 
corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to the million noncash charge taken in related to nl s adoption of sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
this charge is included in selling  general and administrative expense for in nl s consolidated statements of income 
excluding this charge  corporate expenses  net were slightly lower than due to the recognition of million of income in related to the straight line  five year amortization of million of proceeds received in conjunction with the sale of rheox attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business  partially offset by the aforementioned million expense in in nl recorded million of income related to the amortization of this deferred income 
interest expense 
interest expense declined in and compared to the respective prior years due to prepayment of the deutsche mark dm denominated bank credit facility in and prepayments of outstanding indebtedness in  principally the senior secured discount notes  the joint venture term loan and a portion of kronos dm denominated debt 
interest expense in declined compared to principally due to prepayments of this outstanding indebtedness 
assuming no significant change in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to lower levels of outstanding indebtedness and lower margins on variable rate debt 
provision for income taxes 
nl s operations are conducted on a worldwide basis and the geographic mix of income can significantly impact nl s effective income tax rate 
in and nl s effective tax rate varied from the normally expected rate due predominantly to the recognition of certain deductible tax attributes which previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
also in and  nl recognized certain one time benefits related to german tax settlements 
in the geographic mix of income  including losses in certain jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate  contributed to nl s effective tax rate varying from a normally expected rate

based upon nl s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on nl s cash resources as discussed herein  nl expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected 
income tax contingencies 
certain of nl s tax returns in various us and non us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income tax related items and interest 
certain significant german tax contingencies aggregating an estimated dm million million when resolved through were resolved in nl s favor in during the german government enacted certain income tax law changes that were retroactively effective as of january  based on these changes  nl s ongoing current cash income tax rate in germany increased in during nl received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to nl appealed this assessment and  in february  the fredrikstad city court ruled in favor of the norwegian tax authorities on the primary issue  but asserted that such tax authorities assessment was overstated by nok million million at december  
the tax authorities response to the court s assertion is expected by the end of march nl is considering its appeals options 
during nl was informed by the norwegian tax authorities that additional tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  will likely be proposed for the year on an issue similar to the aforementioned case 
the outcome of the case is dependent on the eventual outcome of the case 
although nl believes that it will ultimately prevail  nl has granted a lien for the tax assessment on its fredrikstad  norway tio plant in favor of the norwegian tax authorities and will be required to grant security on the assessment when received 
no assurance can be given that nl s tax matters will be favorably resolved due to the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
nl believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   nl had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
environmental matters and litigation 
in addition to the chemicals business conducted through kronos  nl also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses  and holdings of marketable equity securities including securities issued by valhi and other contran subsidiaries 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant  including sites for which ems has contractually assumed nl s obligation 
nl believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
nl has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually and in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
see item business unconsolidated affiliate nl regulatory and environmental matters 
foreign operations 
as discussed above  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   nl had substantial net assets denominated in the canadian dollar and norwegian kroner  partially offset by a euro denominated net liability 
year issue 
over the past few years  nl spent time  effort and money in order to address the yk issues in an attempt to ensure that computer systems  both information technology it systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology  and software applications would function properly after december  this process included  among other things  the identification of all systems and applications potentially affected by the yk issues  the determination of which systems and applications required remediation and the completion thereof and the testing of systems and applications following remediation for year compliance 
in addition  nl requested confirmation from its major software and hardware vendors  suppliers and customers that they were developing and implementing plans to become  or that they had become  year compliant 
contingency plans were also developed to address potential yk issues related to business interruption in the event one or more of nl s internal systems or the systems of third parties upon which it relies ultimately proved not to be year compliant 
as part of these contingency plans  nl temporarily idled its manufacturing facilities shortly before the end of as an added safeguard against unexpected loss of utility service  all of such facilities resumed production shortly after midnight of year end after all of the efforts described above  nl believed that its key systems were year compliant prior to december  as part of its normal business operations  nl had already installed upgraded information systems at certain locations which addressed the yk issues

nl is exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  nl has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  nl has not generally entered into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor has nl entered into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading purposes 
nl was not a party to any forward or derivative option contracts related to currency exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  or interest rates 
nl is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   nl s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings fixed rate and variable rate 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for nl s aggregate indebtedness at december  and at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in euros in and deutsche marks in information shown below for such euro denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using that date s exchange rate of

nl is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the european union euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations nl industries for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
as described above  at december   nl had million of indebtedness denominated in euros million outstanding denominated in deutsche marks 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million million 
marketable equity security prices 
nl is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million and million  respectively 
other 
nl believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect nl s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for nl s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses nl would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by nl of future events  gains or losses
