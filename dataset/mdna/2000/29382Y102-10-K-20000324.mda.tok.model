item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sync develops and sells frame relay access devices frads  circuit management probe products  digital transmission devices and supporting software 
the company follows a sales strategy relying primarily on a direct sales force and leveraging resellers  distributors  and carriers as delivery channels for its products 
current partners include at t  mci  electronic data systems  unisys and diebold 
in and  the company implemented various expense reduction programs with the goal of enabling the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
however  there can be no assurance that its efforts to implement expense reductions will enable it to become profitable at lower revenue levels  if at all 
also  there can be no assurance that the company s products will achieve significant market penetration  either through its channel partners and other resellers or its direct sales force  or that the company will successfully introduce new and enhanced products or compete effectively in its market 
risk factors the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion under results of operations  inflation  year compliance and liquidity and capital resources constitutes forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following is a description of certain of the major risks and uncertainties 
history of losses  significant fluctuations in operating results  uncertain profitability the company has experienced operating losses since inception  with  in recent years  operating losses of  million in  million in and million in as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors 
factors that have in the past caused  or may in the future cause  the company s revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include the timing of significant orders  the relatively long length of the sales cycles for certain of the company s products  the market conditions in the networking industry  the timing of capital expenditures by the company s target market customers  competition and pricing in the industry  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products  new product introductions by the company s competitors  production or quality problems  changes in material costs  disruption in sources of supply  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and general economic conditions 
in addition  revenues and gross margins may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels employed and the mix of products sold 
for example  the company generally realizes a higher gross margin on direct sales than on sales through its channel partners and other resellers 
accordingly  if channel partners and other resellers account for a large percentage of the company s net revenues  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decline 
the company s future revenues are difficult to predict 
revenues and operating results in any quarter depend on the volume and timing of  and the ability to fulfill  orders received within the quarter 
sales of the company s products typically involve a sales cycle of several months to over a year from the point of initial customer contact until receipt of the first system order  and  in addition  the company has in the past encountered  and may in the future encounter  delays between initial orders and network wide deployment 
there can be no assurance that average sales cycles will not increase in future periods 
during the past year  the company has shifted its efforts from a focus utilizing channel partners to one focused more on a direct sales model while utilizing channel partners for strategic opportunities and fulfillment 
accordingly  the company s revenues in any period are highly dependent upon the sales efforts and success of the company s direct sales force and those channel partners upon which it relies 
there can be no assurance that the company s channel partners and other resellers will give a high priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to competitive products or solutions or that the company s channel partners and other resellers will continue to offer the company s products 
in addition  the company has shifted its focus from large corporate fortune enterprises to the middle market enterprise  those companies with to remote locations 
there can be no assurance that the middle market enterprise prospect customers will select the company s products as compared to alternative product offerings provided by other vendors 
significant portions of the company s expenses are relatively fixed 
if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse effect of a shortfall in sales on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
the company has in the past and may in the future reduce prices or increase spending to respond to competition or to pursue new product or market opportunities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attain or sustain profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
in addition  if the company s operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
uncertain market for frame relay for mission critical applications during  and  sales of frame relay access products  which enable multiprotocol ip  ipx and sna internet working over frame relay  represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the market for sna over frame relay products is maturing 
the success of the company and its channel partners in generating significant sales of frame relay access products will depend in part on their ability to educate end users about the benefits of the company s technology and convince end users to switch their mission critical applications to frame relay rather than remaining on leased line networks or selecting newer and or alternative technologies 
in addition  broad acceptance of frame relay services will also depend upon the tariffs for such services  which are determined by carriers 
if the tariff structure for dedicated leased lines becomes more favorable relative to tariffs for a comparable network utilizing frame relay  the market for frame relay networking products could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the market will adopt frame relay for mission critical applications to any significant extent 
the failure of such adoption to occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s frame relay access products are targeted at the large installed base of ibm customers utilizing sna networks 
ibm has sold  in the past  the company s framenode registered trademark product family under the name ibm nways the agreement between ibm and the company expired in march sales to ibm accounted for  and of the company s net revenues in  and  respectively 
on august   ibm announced its intention to discontinue support for many of its wide area network products and in lieu of such support entered into an arrangement with cisco systems to transition its customers and prospects towards solutions provided by cisco 
the company has relied on ibm products  in certain circumstances  to provide support for sync products at the customer s data center 
due to the ibm announcement  the company will need to enhance its product capability to include interoperability with products provided by vendors other than ibm 
there can be no assurance that ibm will continue to support frame relay  that ibm will not develop or promote sna over frame relay products competitive with the company s products  that the ibm cisco relationship will not adversely impact the company s ability to sell its products  or that the company will be able to sufficiently provide for interoperability between its products and products provided by vendors other that ibm 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
uncertain market acceptance of the company s products  product concentration the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from its frame relay access  circuit management  transmission and related services and expects that revenues from these products will continue to account for substantially all of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
broad market acceptance of  and continuing demand for  these products  is  therefore  critical to the company s future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of the company s products include the extent to which frame relay is adopted for mission critical applications  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  services or pricing relevant to the company  the success of the sales efforts of the company and its resellers and tariff rates for carrier services 
moreover  the company s operating history in the wan internetworking market and its resources are limited relative to certain of its current and potential competitors 
the company s future performance will also depend in part on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on channel partners and other resellers the company s channel partners and other resellers account  and are expected to continue to account  for a relatively large percentage of the company s net revenues  including most of its sales outside of the united states 
sales through channel partners and other resellers accounted for  and of net revenues of the company in  and  respectively 
current partners include at t  mci  electronic data systems  unisys and diebold 
the company has also sold its products through oem relationships with ibm among others 
the agreement between ibm and sync expired in march sales to ibm accounted for  and of the company s net revenues for in   and  respectively 
the company s agreements with its channel partners and other resellers do not restrict the sale of products that compete with those of the company 
each of the company s channel partners or other resellers can cease marketing the company s products at the reseller s option  under certain conditions  with limited notice and with little or no penalty 
in addition  these agreements generally provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period  do not require minimum purchases  prohibit distribution of certain products by the company through certain categories of third parties under certain conditions and provide for manufacturing rights and access to source code upon the occurrence of specified conditions or defaults 
many of the company s channel partners and resellers offer alternative solutions  designed by themselves or third parties and have pre existing relationships with current or potential competitors of the company 
certain of the company s former channel partners have developed competitive products and terminated their relationships with the company  and such developments could occur in the future 
the company generally realizes a higher gross margin on direct sales than on sales through its channel partners and other resellers 
accordingly  as channel partners and other resellers continue to account for a relatively large portion of the company s net revenues  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decline 
there can be no assurance that the company will retain its current channel partners or other resellers or that it will be able to recruit additional or replacement channel partners 
the loss of one or more of the company s channel partners or other resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s channel partners and other resellers will give priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to competitive products or alternative networking solutions or that the company s channel partners and other resellers will continue to offer the company s products 
any reduction or delay in sales of the company s products by its channel partners and other resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change and new products the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion enhancements to its existing products and new products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new products successfully  that such new products will gain market acceptance or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by competitors 
in addition  the company has on occasion experienced delays in the introduction of product enhancements and new products 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to introduce product enhancements or new products on a timely basis 
further  from time to time  the company may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of product enhancements or new product offerings will not cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products or cause resellers to return products to the company 
failure to introduce new products or product enhancements effectively and on a timely basis  customer delays in purchasing products in anticipation of new product introductions and any inability of the company to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product errors products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected software or hardware errors 
such errors have occurred in the past  and there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and customers  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
moreover  there can be no assurance that once detected  such errors can be corrected in a timely manner  if at all 
software errors may take several months to correct  if they can be corrected at all  and hardware errors may take even longer to rectify 
the occurrence of such software or hardware errors  as well as any delay in correcting them  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of the company s products  additional warranty expense  diversion of engineering and other resources from the company s product development efforts or the loss of credibility with the company s end user customers  channel partners and other resellers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intense competition the market for communications products is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change and emerging industry standards 
the company s current competitors include internetworking companies  such as cisco and nortel  frad providers  such as hypercom  motorola and cabletron  and circuit management and digital transmission providers such as visual networks  netscout  digital link  racal  paradyne and adtran  among others 
potential competitors include other internetworking and wan access and transmission companies  frame relay switch providers  and the company s other channel partners 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than does the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than the company 
many also have long standing customer relationships with mid sized and large enterprises that are part of the company s target market  and these relationships may make it more difficult to complete sales of the company s products to these enterprises 
further  certain of the company s former channel partners have developed competitive products and terminated their relationships with the company  and such developments could occur in the future 
as a consequence of all these factors  the company expects increased competition which could result in significant price competition  reduced profit margins or loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on contract manufacturers the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials planning and procurement  light assembly  system integration  testing and quality assurance 
the company has entered into arrangements with contract manufacturers to outsource substantial portions of its board level procurement  assembly and system test operations 
there can be no assurance that these independent contract manufacturers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for manufactured products or that such independent contract manufacturers will not experience quality problems in manufacturing the company s products 
the inability of the company s contract manufacturers to provide the company with adequate supplies of high quality products could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the loss of any of the company s contract manufacturers could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement manufacturer 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s manufacturing procedures may in certain instances create a risk of excess or inadequate inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
any manufacturing delays  excess manufacturing capacity or inventories or inability to increase manufacturing capacity  if required  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on suppliers certain key components used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently purchased only from single or limited sources 
at present  single sourced components include programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits and cables  custom molded plastics and custom tooled sheet metal  and limited sourced components include flash memories  drams  printed circuit boards and selected integrated circuits 
the company generally relies upon contract manufacturers to buy component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies 
the company buys directly final assembly parts  such as plastics and metal covers  cables and other parts used in final configurations 
the company generally does not have long term agreements with any of these single or limited sources of supply 
any loss of a supplier  increase in lead times  cost increases  component supply interruption  or the inability of the company to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if orders do not match forecasts  the company may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices or termination of contracts 
from time to time the company has experienced shortages of certain components and has paid above market prices to acquire such components on an accelerated basis or has experienced delays in fulfilling orders while waiting to obtain the necessary components 
such shortages may occur in the future and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on and risks associated with international sales sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately million  million and million  or  and of the company s net revenues in  and respectively 
the company targets international sales on an opportunistic basis and has historically sold products internationally through partners and resellers 
the company will continue to work with select partners and resellers to generate sales in the european and asian markets 
at this time  international sales are expected to continue to represent a small portion of the company s sales 
failure of the company s international partners and resellers to market the company s products internationally or the loss of any of these resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s ability to increase sales of its products to international end users may be limited if the carrier services  such as frame relay  or protocols supported by the company s products are not widely adopted internationally 
a number of additional risks are inherent in international transactions  including currency valuation 
company s international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in international markets 
international sales may also be limited or disrupted by the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 
in addition  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world typically are adversely affected in the third quarter of each year as many customers and end users reduce their business activities during the summer months 
these international factors could have a material adverse effect on future sales of the company s products to international end users and  consequently  the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology the company s future success depends  in part  upon its proprietary technology 
the company does not hold any patents and currently relies on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in the event that protective measures are not successful  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company is also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into license arrangements or result in litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
should litigation with respect to any such claims commence  such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
tariff and regulatory matters rates for public telecommunications services  including features and capacity of such services  are governed by tariffs determined by carriers and subject to regulatory approval 
future changes in these tariffs could have a material effect on the company s business 
for example  should tariffs for frame relay services increase relative to tariffs for dedicated leased lines  the cost effectiveness of the company s products could be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s products must meet industry standards and receive certification for connection to certain public telecommunications networks prior to their sale 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  the company s products must comply with standards established by the various european community telecommunications authorities 
in addition  carriers require that equipment connected to their networks comply with their own standards 
any future inability to obtain on a timely basis or retain domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certifications or to comply with existing or evolving industry standards could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the continued contributions of its key personnel 
the company believes its future success will also depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
during  the company has undergone significant personnel turnover in research and development  sales  and other functional areas and the company experienced significant turnover in the composition of its executive officers 
such turnover has affected the company s ability to successfully develop new products and generate additional business 
two of the current three executive officers have been officers of the company for less than a year 
the loss of the services of any of the company s key personnel or the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
general economic conditions demand for the company s products depends in large part on the overall demand for communications and networking products  which has in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a decline in demand for its products due to general economic conditions 
any such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
volatility of stock price factors such as announcements of technological innovations or the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  as well as market conditions in the technology sector  may have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
further  the stock market has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and which often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
nasdaq stock listing the company s common stock is listed and traded on the nasdaq stock market 
on january   the company received a letter from nasdaq notifying the company that it has failed to maintain a closing bid price of greater than in accordance with the nasdaq listing requirements 
in order to comply with the nasdaq listing requirements  on june  the company implemented a for reverse stock split that was approved by the company s stockholders at the annual meeting on june  as a result of the reverse stock split  the company has maintained its stock price above the per share minimum level  and  accordingly  was informed by nasdaq that it had met the requirements for continued listing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet the minimum closing bid price or any other nasdaq listing requirements on an ongoing basis 
anti takeover provisions the company is subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s charter documents  including provisions eliminating cumulative voting  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call meetings or to take actions by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management of the company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
certain of the company s stock option and purchase plans and agreements provide for assumption of such plans  or  alternatively  immediate vesting upon a change of control or similar event 
in addition  the company has entered into severance agreements with its officers  pursuant to which they are entitled to defined severance payments if they are actually or constructively terminated within specified time periods following a change of control of the company 
the board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
the company has no present plan to issue shares of preferred stock
