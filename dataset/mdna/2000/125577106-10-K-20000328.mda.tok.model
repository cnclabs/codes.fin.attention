item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview for the year ended december   our net income totaled million  increasing from million in and million in the earnings represented the twelfth consecutive increase in annual earnings  and the ninth consecutive year of record earnings 
the results reflect continued growth in the commercial and equipment finance portfolios  solid fee generation  improved consumer business profitability and continued strong credit quality 
current year net income also includes earnings of million for the former newcourt operations from the november  acquisition date through december  the improvements in over resulted from stronger revenues from a higher level of financing and leasing assets  lower commercial credit losses and improvements in operating efficiency 
the following table summarizes our net income and related data  excluding the special items 
years ended december  net income dollars in millions earnings per diluted share eps return on average stockholders equity roe 
return on average earning assets roa the earnings included a one time million pretax gain on the sale of an equity interest acquired in a loan workout partially offset by certain non recurring expenses principally related to our fourth quarter ipo 
including these special items  net income was million  with eps of  roe of and roa of 
managed assets totaled billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase of over reflects primarily the acquisition of over billion in newcourt managed assets in late the remainder of the increase reflects strong new business volume and two strategic factoring purchases in the commercial finance segment  offset by a drop in consumer assets due to our decision to discontinue certain product lines and liquidate our recreational boat and wholesale inventory finance portfolios 
the increase of over was principally due to record internally generated new business  with strong performance across all cit segments 
see financing and leasing assets for additional information 
net finance income and margin we earn finance income on the loans and leases we provide to our borrowers and equipment users 
the interest expense is the cost to us of borrowing funds used to make loans and purchase equipment to lease to customers 
the excess of finance income over interest expense is net finance income 
during our net finance income as a percentage of aea increased significantly  due to a higher level of operating leases in considering this growing proportion of operating leases in the portfolio  we believe that a more meaningful measure of profitability is finance income after depreciation on operating lease equipment or net finance margin 
a comparison of the components of  and net finance income and net finance margin is set forth below 
years ended december  dollars in millions finance income    interest expense   net finance income  depreciation on operating lease equipment net finance margin average earning assets aea    net finance income as a of aea net finance margin as a of aea net finance margin increased in from  and in from the increases primarily reflect growth in our loans  leases and operating leases 
as a percentage of aea  net finance margin was versus and in and  respectively 
this downward three year trend primarily reflects the growing operating leasing business which generally has lower net finance margins than finance receivables  but which also generates equipment gains  renewal fees and tax depreciation benefits 
finance income totaled  million in   million in and  million in as a percentage of aea excluding interest income related to short term interest bearing deposits  finance income was in  in and in the increase in yield in reflected primarily changes in product mix  while the decline in yield in was principally due to the decline in market interest rates and the highly competitive marketplace 
interest expense totaled  million in   million in and million in as a percentage of aea  interest expense excluding interest relating to short term interest bearing deposits and dividends related to preferred capital securities was in  in and in  reflecting lower market interest rates 
although interest expense as a percentage of aea for the full year was below the prior year  interest rates escalated during the latter part of see note debt for further information regarding interest rates during and as of the years ended  and we seek to mitigate interest rate risk by matching the repricing characteristics of our assets with our liabilities  which is in part done through the use of derivative financial instruments  principally interest rate swaps 
for further discussion  see market risk management 
the operating equipment lease portfolio was billion at december  versus billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
as a result  depreciation on operating lease equipment was million in  versus million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of average operating leases  depreciation was   and in  and  respectively 
the increase in over reflects the impact of the former newcourt portfolio  which includes smaller ticket and shorter term assets than the existing cit business 
this mitigates the impact of an increasing proportion of airline and rail assets with longer depreciable lives from to in the equipment financing and leasing segment 
see financing and leasing assets for further discussion on growth of our operating lease portfolio 
fees and other income fees and other income improved to million during  from million during and million during as set forth in the following table 
years ended december  dollars in millions factoring commissions fees and other income gains on sales of leasing equipment gains on securitizations gains on sales of venture capital investments the increase reflects primarily an increase in factoring commissions  due in part to the two acquisitions completed during the year  and syndication fees in fees and other income from the newcourt acquisition 
the former newcourt operations contributed million in total fees and other income for the period from the acquisition date through december  included in fees and other income are gains recognized by increased sales of receivables million in and million in 
total fees and other income increased in from primarily due to higher fees from servicing and commercial businesses and improved gains on the sale of equipment coming off lease  offset by lower gains on securitizations 
we expect this trend of increasing fees and other income to continue in the future given the higher proportion of fee based business within the former newcourt and factoring businesses 
gain on sale of equity interest acquired in loan workout we originated a loan in the s to a telecommunications company that subsequently went into default 
pursuant to a workout agreement  the stock of that company was transferred to us and a co lender 
in  we received all amounts due and retained an equity interest in such telecommunications company  which we sold in the second quarter of at a pretax gain of million 
salaries and general operating expenses salaries and general operating expenses were million in  million in  and million in during  core operating expense growth was modest due to consumer business productivity improvements and increased use of electronic data exchange in our factoring business 
however  expenses increased in due to the newcourt and factoring acquisitions 
the largest portion of this increase was in employee costs and facilities expenses 
the expenses included a million pretax charge relating to the termination of a long term incentive plan in connection with the ipo  higher performance based incentive accruals  and a provision for vacant leased space 
without these items  salaries and general operating expenses would have been million 
our personnel increased to approximately  at december  from  at december  and  at december   primarily reflecting the late newcourt acquisition 
we manage expenditures using a comprehensive budgetary process 
expenses are monitored closely by business unit management and are reviewed monthly with our senior management 
to ensure overall project cost control  an approval and review procedure is in place for major capital expenditures  such as purchases of computer equipment  including post implementation evaluations 
management monitors productivity via the analysis of an efficiency ratio and the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to ama 
ama is comprised of average earning assets plus the average of finance receivables previously securitized and currently managed by us 
these ratios  excluding goodwill amortization and the non recurring pretax gain and expenses previously described  are set forth in the following table 
years ended december  efficiency ratio salaries and general operating expenses as a percentage of ama the efficiency ratio includes the results of newcourt from the november  acquisition date through year end 
newcourt s efficiency ratio has historically been significantly higher than cit s 
the deterioration in the efficiency ratio in from reflects the impact of the newcourt acquisition  as integration cost savings are not expected to be fully realized until the latter part of year and beyond 
as the former newcourt operations results are only included for the period from november  to december   the expense ratio will likely increase in the near term before expense savings and efficiency enhancements take effect 
in connection with the acquisition  we established an integration plan which identified activities that would not continue and the associated costs of exiting those activities 
the plan identified areas for adjusting the amount of real estate required including the closing of the newcourt corporate location in new jersey  reducing corporate office space in toronto  canada and eliminating various other operating locations throughout the united states and canada 
the plan also outlined that approximately employees would be involuntarily terminated 
further  additional restructuring activities  which were contemplated in our overall integration plan  may occur in the year goodwill amortization goodwill amortization was million in versus million and million in and  respectively 
this trend reflects the partial year impact of the acquisitions of newcourt  heller and congress  each of which were accounted for under the purchase method 
reserve and provision for credit losses credit quality our consolidated reserve for credit losses increased to million of finance receivables at december   from million at december  and million at december  the increases in amount and percentage primarily reflect the newcourt acquisition 
the acquired newcourt portfolio had a higher reserve percentage than cit s  commensurate with its higher past due loan and charge off profile 
the reserve increases in and reflect growth in finance receivables in each year 
the ratio of the consolidated reserve for credit losses to non accrual finance receivables was at year end our consolidated reserve for credit losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy considering economic conditions  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including charge off experience and levels of past due loans and non performing assets 
it is management s judgment that the consolidated reserve for credit losses is adequate to provide for potential credit losses 
we review finance receivables periodically to determine the probability of loss  and take charge offs after considering such factors as the obligor s financial condition and the value of underlying collateral and guarantees 
automatic charge offs are recorded on consumer finance receivables at intervals beginning at days of contractual delinquency  based upon historical loss severity 
the consolidated reserve for credit losses is intended to provide for future events  which by their nature are uncertain 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may necessitate additions or deductions to the consolidated reserve for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was million for  million for  and million for net charge offs were million for  million for  and million for our net charge off experience is provided in the following table 
years ended december  net credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables excluding finance receivables held for sale equipment financing and leasing commercial finance consumer total charge offs of the acquired newcourt portfolio have been historically higher as a percentage of average finance receivables than cit s experience as shown above 
accordingly  charge offs as a percentage of average finance receivables will increase in the short term 
the decrease in our equipment financing and leasing segment s net credit losses reflects continued improvement in credit quality in our portfolio and sustained strength of the united states economy 
the three year trend in commercial finance net credit losses reflects unusually high recoveries in as a percentage of average managed finance receivables  consumer net credit losses were for  for  and for past due and non performing assets the following table sets forth certain information concerning our past due and non performing assets and the related percentages of finance receivables at december   and the amounts and ratios below do not reflect various portfolio transfers between the former newcourt business units and the equipment financing and leasing segment 
at december  dollars in millions finance receivables  past due days or more equipment financing and leasing newcourt commercial finance consumer total non performing assets equipment financing and leasing newcourt commercial finance consumer total for these calculations  certain finance receivables held for sale and the associated past due and non performing balances are included 
non performing assets reflect both finance receivables on non accrual status and assets received in satisfaction of loans 
the increase in our overall delinquency and non performing asset ratio was in a large part due to the acquired newcourt portfolios which carry a higher level of delinquency and non performing assets 
in  equipment financing and leasing past due loans increased  however non performing assets remained relatively stable at 
the increase in equipment financing and leasing past dues included three commercial aircraft that became past due in the fourth quarter 
we believe the carrying values are adequately supported by the underlying aircraft collateral 
the increase in consumer delinquencies and non performing assets reflects increases in the manufactured housing portfolio  whereas the increase in consumer delinquencies and non performing assets from to primarily relates to the seasoning of home equity receivables and the growth and expansion of the wholesale inventory financing product line 
during  equipment financing and leasing non performing assets increased to a more normal level from the particularly low year end balance 
income taxes the provision for federal  state and local and foreign income taxes totaled million in  compared with million in  and million in the effective income tax rate for declined to  compared with in  and in  primarily as a result of lower state and local taxes 
results by business segment net income for improved million or from  as all of our original business segments improved from both the equipment financing and leasing and commercial finance segments improved approximately from  due to the continuation of strong asset growth 
the commercial finance segment results also reflected the heller and congress acquisitions 
the consumer segment earnings grew by and benefited from improved efficiency and gains on receivable sales 
the increased corporate expense in over included higher goodwill amortization  higher corporate interest expense and the absence of venture capital investment gains 
the net income improved million  or from  as the earnings improvement in the equipment financing and leasing segment was mitigated by the more modest earnings growth of in the commercial finance segment and a million reduction in net income from the prior year in the consumer segment reflecting higher net credit losses

commercial airline industry commercial airline financing and leasing assets totaled billion of our total financing and leasing assets and aircraft at december  compared with billion and aircraft in the acquisition of newcourt increased our portfolio by approximately billion  represented by aircraft 
our portfolio is secured by commercial aircraft and related equipment 
from through mid  we limited the growth of our aerospace portfolio due to weakness in the commercial airline industry  industry overcapacity and declining equipment values 
in  we decided to resume growing the aerospace portfolio  but will continue to monitor this growth relative to our total financing and leasing assets 
we continue to reduce our stage ii exposure so that of our portfolio at december  consists of stage iii aircraft versus at december  all of our stage ii aircraft are currently deployed outside the continental united states 
we continue to shift our commercial aircraft product mix from secured financings to operating lease equipment  relying on our strong industry and equipment management and remarketing expertise to compete effectively in commercial aircraft operating lease transactions 
operating lease transactions accounted for of the total commercial airline portfolio outstanding at december   at december   and at december  during  we entered into agreements with both airbus industries and the boeing company to purchase a total of aircraft  for a total commitment of approximately billion  with options to acquire additional units 
deliveries of these new aircraft are scheduled to take place over a five year period starting in the fourth quarter of risk management our business activities contain various elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk to be credit risk including credit  collateral and equipment risk and market risk including interest rate  foreign currency and liquidity risk 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our commercial and consumer businesses and to maintaining profitability 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
credit risk management we have developed systems specifically designed to manage credit risk in our commercial and consumer business segments 
we evaluate financing and leasing assets for credit and collateral risk during the credit granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds 
in response to our growing businesses  a corporate credit risk management group  which reports to the chief risk officer  was formed in the fourth quarter of to oversee and manage credit risk throughout cit 
this group s structure includes senior credit executive alignment with each of the business units  as well as a senior executive with corporate wide asset recovery and work out responsibilities 
this group reviews non traditional transactions and transactions which are outside of established target market definitions and risk acceptance criteria or which exceed the strategic business units credit authority 
in addition  an executive credit committee ecc  which includes the chairman and chief executive officer  the chief risk officer  and three members of the corporate credit risk management group  approves credits that are beyond the authority of the business units 
the credit risk management group also includes an independent credit audit function  which previously was part of our internal audit group 
each of our strategic business units has developed and implemented a formal credit management process in accordance with formal uniform guidelines established by the credit risk management group 
these guidelines set forth risk acceptance criteria for o acceptable maximum credit line  o selected target markets and products  o creditworthiness of borrowers  including credit history  financial condition  adequacy of cash flow and quality of management  and o the type and value of underlying collateral and guarantees including recourse from dealers and manufacturers 
we also employ a risk adjusted pricing process where the perceived credit risk is a factor in determining the interest rate and or fees charged for our financing and leasing products 
as economic and market conditions change  credit risk management practices are reviewed and modified  if necessary  to seek to minimize the risk of credit loss 
for small ticket business originated in our vendor technology finance business unit and the consumer segment  we utilize automated credit scoring capabilities 
the vendor technology finance capability  which was acquired in the newcourt purchase  dates back to the late s 
in these proprietary models  we utilize statistical techniques in analyzing customer attributes  including industry and corporate data  trade payment history  and other credit bureau information 
model scores are measured against actual delinquency and loss experience 
modifications are made to the models based upon this monitoring effort as appropriate 
compliance with established corporate policies and procedures and the credit management processes at each strategic business unit are reviewed by the credit audit group 
the credit audit group examines adherence with established credit policies and procedures and tests for inappropriate credit practices  including whether potential problem accounts are being detected and reported on a timely basis 
the credit audit group reports to the chief risk officer and to the audit committee 
commercial 
we have developed systems specifically designed to effectively manage credit risk in our commercial segments 
the process starts with the initial evaluation of credit risk and underlying collateral at the time of origination and continues over the life of the finance receivable or operating lease  including collecting past due balances and liquidating underlying collateral 
credit personnel of the applicable strategic business unit review each potential borrower s financial condition  results of operations  management  industry  customer base  operations  collateral and other data  such as third party credit reports  to thoroughly evaluate the customer s borrowing and repayment ability 
borrowers are graded according to credit quality based upon our uniform credit grading system  which grades both the borrower s financial condition and the underlying collateral 
credit facilities are subject to approval within our overall credit approval and underwriting guidelines and are issued commensurate with the credit evaluation performed on each borrower 
we review and monitor credit exposures on an ongoing basis to identify  as early as possible  those customers that may be experiencing declining creditworthiness or financial difficulty  and periodically evaluate our commercial segments finance receivables based upon credit criteria developed under our uniform credit grading system 
we monitor concentrations by borrower  industry  geographic region and equipment type and management adjusts limits as conditions warrant to seek to minimize the risk of credit loss 
our asset quality review committee is comprised of members of senior management  including the chief risk officer  the executive vice president credit administration and the chief financial officer 
periodically  this committee will meet with the chairman and chief executive officer of cit to review  among other topics  levels of geographic  industry and customer concentrations 
in addition  the committee periodically meets with senior executives of our strategic business units and corporate credit risk management group to review the status of financing and leasing assets greater than  to obligors with higher risk profiles 
consumer 
for consumer loans  our management has developed and implemented proprietary automated credit scoring models for each loan type that include both customer demographics and credit bureau characteristics 
the profiles emphasize  among other things  occupancy status  length of residence  length of employment  debt to income ratio ratio of total installment debt and housing expenses to gross monthly income  bank account references  credit bureau information and combined loan to value ratio 
the models are used to assess a potential borrower s credit standing and repayment ability considering the value or adequacy of property offered as collateral 
our credit criteria include reliance on credit scores  including those based upon both our proprietary internal credit scoring model and external credit bureau scoring  combined with judgment 
the credit scoring models are regularly reviewed for effectiveness utilizing statistical tools 
we regularly evaluate the consumer loan portfolio using past due  vintage curve and other statistical tools to analyze trends and credit performance by loan type  including analysis of specific credit characteristics and other selected subsets of the portfolios 
adjustments to credit scorecards and lending programs are made when deemed appropriate 
individual underwriters are assigned credit authority based upon their experience  performance and understanding of the underwriting policies and procedures of our consumer operations and a credit approval hierarchy exists to ensure that all applications are reviewed by an underwriter with the appropriate level of authority 
see reserve and provision for credit losses credit quality 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments including interest rate risk  foreign exchange risk  derivative credit risk and liquidity risk 
we engage in transactions  in the normal course of business  that expose us to market risks and we maintain management practices and policies designed to effectively mitigate such risks 
our capital committee sets policies  oversees and guides the interest rate and currency risk management process  including establishment and monitoring of risk metrics  and ensures the implementation of those policies 
other risks monitored by the capital committee include derivative credit risk and liquidity risk 
the capital committee is comprised of members of senior management including the chairman and chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  the treasurer  and the controller 
business unit executives also serve on the capital committee on a rotational basis 
we seek to preserve company value by hedging changes in future expected net cash flows and or by decreasing the cost of capital 
strategies for managing market risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates are an integral part of the process  since those strategies affect our future expected cash flows as well as our cost of capital 
interest rate and foreign exchange risk management 
we offer a variety of financing products to our customers including fixed and floating rate loans of various maturities and currency denominations  and a variety of leases  including operating leases 
changes in market interest rates  or in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or in the relationships between different interest rate indices ie  basic risk  can affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which can result in an increase in interest expense relative to finance income 
we measure our asset liability position in both economic terms and by its periodic effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis and duration analysis 
a matched position is generally achieved through a combination of on and off balance sheet financial instruments  including the issuance of commercial paper and medium and long term debt  interest rate and currency swaps  foreign exchange contracts  syndication and securitization 
we do not speculate on interest rates and foreign exchange rates  but rather seek to mitigate the possible impact of such rate fluctuations encountered in the normal course of business 
this is an ongoing process due to prepayments  refinancings  actual payments varying from contractual terms  as well as other portfolio dynamics 
we periodically enter into structured financings involving both the issuance of debt and an interest rate swap with corresponding notional principal amount and maturity that not only improve liquidity and reduce interest rate risk  but result in a lower overall funding cost than could be achieved by solely issuing debt 
interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of billion at december  and billion at december  were designated as hedges against outstanding debt and were principally used to convert the interest rate on variable rate debt to a fixed rate that sets our fixed rate term debt borrowing cost over the life of the swap 
these hedges reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  but also reduce the benefits from lower interest rates 
a comparative analysis of the weighted average principal outstanding and interest rates paid on our debt before and after the effect of interest rate swaps is shown in the following table 
at december  before swaps dollars in millions commercial paper and variable rate senior notes    fixed rate senior and subordinated notes    composite    at december  after swaps dollars in millions commercial paper and variable rate senior notes    fixed rate senior and subordinated notes    composite    the weighted average composite interest rate after swaps in each of the years presented increased from the composite interest rate before swaps primarily because a larger proportion of our debt  after giving effect to interest rate swaps  was subject to a fixed interest rate 
however  the weighted average interest rates before swaps do not necessarily reflect the interest expense that would have been incurred had we chosen to manage interest rate risk without the use of such swaps 
derivatives are discussed further in note derivative financial instruments of
