this increase in macintosh unit sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of imac  the company s moderately priced desktop macintosh system designed for the education and consumer markets  and the introduction of ibook  the company s consumer and education oriented notebook computer introduced at the end of the company sold approximately million imacs in  an increase of approximately  units or over imac unit sales in during  the company sold approximately  ibooks 
ibook contributed million to net sales during the company also experienced modest gains in combined unit sales of its professionally oriented macintosh systems  powermacs and powerbooks 
growth in net sales and unit sales was strong in all of the company s geographic operating segments  particularly in europe and japan 
profitability the company experienced improved profitability in operating income before special charges rose to million in from million in improved profitability was driven by the increase in net sales  stable overall gross margins in as compared to  and a relatively modest increase in operating expenses before special charges of 
operating trends despite overall increases during in net sales  unit sales  and profitability  the company s performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal was disappointing 
net sales during the fourth quarter fell short of the company s expectations by approximately million causing operating margin before special charges to fall to for the quarter as compared to the experienced during the first nine months of fiscal the fourth quarter revenue shortfall was primarily the result of three factors 
first  fourth quarter net sales of the g cube  a new macintosh system announced and introduced by the company during the fourth quarter  did not meet the company s expectations 
in combination with related displays  g cube sales were approximately million short of expectations 
second  net sales in the company s education market fell short of expectations by approximately million 
third  although total fourth quarter power mac unit sales were close to expectations  the company experienced an unanticipated mix shift towards lower priced power mac configurations resulting in lower than anticipated net sales for the quarter of approximately million 
the company ended with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell through of the company s products during the fourth quarter 
outlook the company currently anticipates a significant sequential decline in quarterly net sales during the first quarter of fiscal to approximately billion 
this decline is anticipated because of a continued deterioration in demand experienced by the company during the first two months of fiscal  rebate programs and price cuts instituted during the first quarter that will cost the company approximately million  and a plan to reduce substantially by the end of the first quarter the level of inventory in the company s distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal in addition  the company expects to incur approximately million of cancellation charges related to purchase orders for proprietary components due to the reduced sales outlook 
as a result of these factors  the company anticipates reporting a net loss  before the effect of any investment gains  in the range of million to million for the first quarter of for all of  the company anticipates net sales will decline as compared to  falling in the range of billion to billion 
the company currently expects that it will be profitable  before the effect of any investment gains  during each of the last three quarters of the foregoing statements concerning the company s anticipated operating results during the first quarter of and the company s anticipated operating result for all of are forward looking 
the company s actual results could differ 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon general economic conditions  market conditions within the pc industry  and the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly competitive market for personal computers 
some of the potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition are discussed throughout this item  including the discussion under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
net sales net sales for geographic segments and macintosh unit sales by geographic segment and by product follow net sales in millions and macintosh unit sales in thousands change change americas net sales    europe net sales    japan net sales  asia pacific net sales other segments net sales total net sales    americas macintosh unit sales    europe macintosh unit sales  japan macintosh unit sales asia pacific macintosh unit sales total macintosh unit sales    power macintosh unit sales    powerbook unit sales g cube unit sales imac unit sales a    ibook unit sales total macintosh unit sales    a unit sales figures for imac in include sales of the company s previous consumer and education oriented macintosh products 
net sales rose to a total of billion in as compared to the increase in net sales resulted directly from a increase in macintosh unit sales 
driving unit sales growth was a increase in combined unit sales of the company s consumer and education macintosh systems  imac and ibook  and a modest increase of in combined units sales of the company s professionally oriented macintosh systems 
combined unit sales of imac and ibook systems accounted for of total macintosh unit sales in and in this trend highlights the increasing importance to the company of its consumer and education markets 
during  the average revenue per macintosh system  a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total macintosh cpu unit sales  of  was relatively unchanged from this was due to increased unit sales of higher priced power mac  powerbook  ibook  and g cube systems offset by increases in unit sales of lower priced imac systems 
additional comments regarding net sales for may be found above under the heading fiscal overview 
net sales increased million or to billion in compared to the primary source of this growth was an overall increase in macintosh unit sales  which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the company s geographic operating segments 
offsetting the rise in unit shipments during was a decline in the average revenue per macintosh system which fell to  from  in the decline during in the average revenue per macintosh system was attributable to lower pricing for both imac and power mac products  which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower pricing 
the decline was also attributable to the shift in the company s unit mix toward lower priced consumer products such that imac units and comparable products comprised of total macintosh unit sales in versus in net sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter by million or  and declined million or compared to the same period in similarly  macintosh unit sales declined and during the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of and the same period in  respectively 
the primary causes for these declines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of powerpc g processors from motorola and production interruptions at vendors supplying powerbooks and ibooks experienced during the last week of the fourth quarter of as a result of the earthquake in taiwan on september  the shortage of g processors reduced power macintosh net sales by approximately million during the fourth quarter of segment operating performance the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis 
the company s geographic segments include the americas  europe  japan  and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes both north and south america 
the european segment includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa 
the japan segment includes only japan  while the asia pacific segment includes australia and asia except for japan 
each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services 
further information regarding the company s operating segments may be found in part ii  item on this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note  segment information and geographic data  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
americas net sales and unit sales in the americas segment increased and  respectively  during as compared to during  the americas segment represented approximately and of the company s total net sales and total macintosh unit sales  respectively 
the growth of the americas net sales in was indicative of strong growth in unit sales of imac and ibook and relatively flat unit sales of professionally oriented macintosh systems 
net sales in the americas segment increased to billion during as compared to  while macintosh unit sales increased 
this followed a decline in net sales in the americas between and during  the americas segment represented approximately and of the company s total net sales and total macintosh unit sales  respectively 
the results experienced by this segment in reflect the overall trends experienced by the company during of increasing macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per macintosh system 
europe net sales in the europe segment increased during driven by a increase in macintosh unit sales 
growth in unit sales resulted from a increase in combined unit sales of imac and ibook  and an increase of in combined units sales of the company s professionally oriented macintosh systems 
net sales in the europe segment increased to billion during as compared to  while macintosh unit sales increased 
this followed a decline in net sales in the europe segment between and like the americas segment  europe s results in as compared to were indicative of strong growth in macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per macintosh system 
japan and asia pacific net sales in the japan segment increased to billion in as compared to  while japan s macintosh unit sales increased 
the fact that japan s net sales rose at a higher rate than its unit sales reflects several factors 
first  imac unit sales in japan were relatively flat year over year 
second  unit sales of ibook  which generally carry a higher price than imac units and which were first sold in japan during  accounted for approximately of japan s total macintosh unit sales during third  japan saw a increase in combined unit sales of the company s professionally oriented macintosh systems 
the majority of the increase in both net sales and unit sales in the asia pacific segment can be attributed to sales of the g cube and ibook  both of which were introduced in the region during macintosh unit sales and net sales in asia  particularly in japan  recovered during from the declines experienced in net sales in the japan segment increased or million to a total of million in as compared to macintosh unit sales in japan increased during compared to while macintosh unit sales in the asia pacific segment increased 
the increases in net sales and macintosh unit sales in both japan and asia pacific are the result of strong imac sales experienced by these operating segments  strong growth in japanese consumer sales  and the general economic recovery experienced in the region 
backlog in the company s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects 
in particular  backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages 
backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply 
because of the foregoing  backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 
further information regarding the company s backlog may be found below under the subheading product introductions and transitions included under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
gross margin gross margin was relatively stable during as compared to  declining to during from during the half point decline is primarily the result of a shift in mix of unit sales away from the company s higher priced  higher margin professionally oriented macintosh systems towards its lower priced  lower margin consumer and education oriented macintosh systems 
also contributing to the relative stability of its gross margin  the company experienced relatively stable component pricing during as compared to gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during to as compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to declines in the cost of various components of the company s products  improvements in manufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final assembly of certain of the company s products  improved design of products leading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs  and relatively stable pricing of the company s products over the last six months of during  the company was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily in and that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient distribution model for its products 
there can be no assurance current gross margins will be maintained  targeted gross margin levels will be achieved  or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services  and potential changes to the company s product mix  including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
research and development the company recognizes focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
expenditures on research and development increased or million to million in as compared to this followed a million or increase in as compared to spending on r d has remained at approximately of net sales during each of the last three years 
the overall increase in r d spending over the last two years is directly related to increases in r d headcount of approximately over that time to support expanded product development efforts 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenditures increased to  million in as compared to and decreased to of net sales in from in this increase in total expenditures resulted from higher spending for promotional and marketing activities  increased sales expenses resulting from higher net sales  and a increase in combined sales  marketing  and general and administrative headcount from the end of to the end of selling  general  and administrative expenditures increased to million in as compared to and increased to of net sales in from in these increases are primarily the result of increased spending on marketing and promotional activities throughout and a increase in combined sales  marketing  and general and administrative headcount from the end of to the end of special charges restructuring actions during the first quarter of  the company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an million restructuring charge

approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft 
the other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus

first  the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased million or during second  the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash equivalents and short term investments increased to as of the end of compared to at the end of the combination of these first two factors increased interest income during by million 
third  interest expense declined million during as a result of the conversion of approximately million of the company s convertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of during  the company experienced a million increase in net interest income  primarily the result of higher cash and investment balances  and by decreased interest expense associated with the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes during the third quarter of gain from sale of investment the company holds a significant equity investment in arm holdings plc arm  a publicly held company in the united kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology

the valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from next  the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the internal revenue code 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
the company s effective tax rate for was compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes were provided

as of september   the company had billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  an increase of million or over the same balances at the end of during  the company s primary source of cash was million in cash flows from operating activities 
cash generated by operations was primarily from net income and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s cash and cash equivalent balances as of september  and september  include million and million  respectively  pledged primarily as collateral against outstanding derivative positions 
in addition to the net purchase of short term investments of million  net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of million for the purchase of long term investments  including million invested in earthlink network  inc earthlink discussed below  and million for the purchase of fixed assets 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from sales of arm shares of million 
the company currently expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately million during to accommodate information systems enhancements and strategic initiatives 
in july  the company s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
this repurchase plan does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time 
during  the company repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
since inception of the plan  the company has repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
the company believes its balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months  including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan 
however  given the company s current non investment grade debt ratings standard and poor s rating agency of bb and moody s investor services of ba  if the company should need to obtain short term borrowings  there can be no assurance such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates 
the inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity

factors that may affect future results and financial condition because of the following factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
competition the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
the company s results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality  hardware performance  and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
further  as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet  an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company s existing products 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including consumer  education  and design and publishing 
additionally  several of the company s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design  technical features  and solutions of the company s products 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
additionally  the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another 
the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing microsoft windows operating systems 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms 
product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
during  the company plans to introduce a new client operating system  mac os x  which will offer advanced functionality based on apple and next software technologies 
inability to successfully introduce mac os x on a timely basis  gain customer acceptance  obtain the commitment of developers to transition existing applications to run on mac os x  or ensure adequate backward compatibility of mac os x with applications authored for previous version of the mac os  may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
inventory and supply the company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry  no assurance can be given the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may again have  a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
consistent with industry practice  components are normally acquired through purchase orders typically covering the company s requirements for periods from to days 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
the company ended with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell through of the company s products during the fourth quarter 
the company currently anticipates a significant sequential decline in quarterly net sales during the first quarter of fiscal  in part due to the company s plan to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal to more normal levels by the end of the first quarter 
many of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
in addition  the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
although certain components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  other key components including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources 
some other key components including without limitation dram  tft lcd flat panel displays  and optical and magnetic disk drives  while currently available to the company from multiple sources  are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
in addition  new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers 
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries such as the cellular phone and automotive industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source  or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and motorola  the sole suppliers of the powerpc risc based microprocessor for the company s macintosh computers  to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation  and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the windows operating systems 
apple has been unable to ship macintosh systems with powerpc g microprocessors running above megahertz since such systems were first announced in august of due to its g microprocessor supplier s inability to provide the company with faster g microprocessors 
similar but less pronounced supply issues have also arisen with the company s supply of faster powerpc g microprocessors 
the company believes that this inability to obtain faster microprocessors had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations during  particularly towards the end of the fiscal year 
the company has been informed by its suppliers that faster microprocessors will be available in sufficient quantity beginning in the first half of calendar however  no assurance can be given that such faster microprocessors will actually be available or be available in sufficient quantities  and the inability of the company to obtain faster microprocessors in sufficient quantities during may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading raw materials  and in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note under the subheading concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and product  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
education market several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers 
as a result  the company s overall share of this market has declined 
additionally  net sales in the company s education market fell short of expectations by approximately million during the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of the company s transition to a more direct sales model from a model heavily dependent on third party sales agents 
although the company has initiated a plan to strengthen its position in the education market  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain its existing share of that market 
failure to increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
marketing and distribution the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers and cataloguers 
in addition  the company also sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets to consumers  certain education customers  and certain resellers either directly or through its on line stores around the world 
many of the company s significant resellers operate on narrow product margins  and may distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
global market risks a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased 
historically  the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada  and certain parts of asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weaknesses in foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and the euro  can adversely impact consumer demand for the company s products and the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales 
conversely  strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can effect the cost to the company of product components  negatively impacting the company s results of operations

support from third party software developers the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications 
the company also believes the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market  as well as the company s decision to end its mac os licensing program  have caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
in addition  past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company s products 
moreover  the company s current plan to introduce mac os x during could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current mac os  and there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop software for mac os x on a timely basis or at all 
in august  the company and microsoft corporation entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements 
in addition  for a period of five years from august  and subject to certain limitations related to the number of macintosh computers sold by the company  microsoft will make future versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products for the mac os 
although microsoft has announced its intention to do so  these agreements do not require microsoft to produce future versions of its products that are optimized to run on mac os x 
the company will bundle the internet explorer product with mac os system software releases and make that product the default internet browser for such mac os releases 
while the company believes its relationship with microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the mac os  the microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the company competes with microsoft  including the windows platform 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the mac os  including mac os x  not covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating system 
in addition  the microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on  among other things  the company s relationship with other partners 
there can be no assurance that the benefits to the company of the microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages 
patents and intellectual property many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods  the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
because of technological changes in the computer industry  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others 
the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
however  no litigation has arisen out of any of these claims that has had  or is expected to have  an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that any necessary patent or other rights could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that the company would prevail in any such challenge 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or litigation arising out of such claims  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
product  geographic  and channel mix the company s profit margins vary among its products  its geographic markets  and its distribution channels 
as a result  the overall profitability of the company in any given period will depend  in part  on the product  geographic  and channel mix reflected in that period s net sales 
intra quarter sales cycle apple generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months  a pattern typical in the personal computer industry 
this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics or components suppliers  can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where many of the company s employees are located 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in the company s stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees 
minority investments the company holds minority investments in several public companies including samsung electronics co  akamai technologies  inc  earthlink  and arm holdings plc 
the combined fair market value of these investments was approximately million as of september  the company has categorized its investments in these companies as available for sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility 
while the overall financial impact of these investments has been positive through the end of  adverse changes in general market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying companies could result in the company s inability to ultimately realize the gains associated with the carrying value of these investments 
permanent impairment in the value of one or all of these investments could cause the company to recognize a loss on some portion of its original million investment remaining in these four companies 
euro transition on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro is now traded on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the transition period for introduction of the euro ends on january  the company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities  review the ability of financial institution vendors to support euro transactions  and examine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the euro conversion 
additionally  the company has begun the process of updating its internal systems and processes to accommodate full transition to the euro as the transaction and reporting currency for its affected european subsidiaries 
the transition to the euro may have competitive implications on the company s pricing and marketing strategies  the impact of which are not known at this time 
additionally  the company is at risk to the extent its principal european suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the euro transition 
adoption of the euro and the costs incurred to prepare for that adoption are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  there can be no assurance all issues related to the euro conversion have been identified or that adoption issues identified will be addressed properly or on a timely basis 
failure to properly identify and address issues associated with adoption of the euro could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
volatility of stock price the company s stock has experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock in the future 
other factors the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations  including certain major vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement that the company provide consumers with the ability to return to the company product at the end of its useful life  and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws  no assurance can be given such laws  or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment  will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non hedge portfolios  the company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap  option and floor positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge  there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
the company will adopt sfas no 
as of october  management does not believe that adoption of the new accounting standard will significantly alter the company s hedging strategies 
however  its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investments and long term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments

the company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program 
the company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management 
the interest rate swaps  which qualify as accounting hedges  generally require the company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month us dollar libor and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts 
these swaps effectively convert the company s fixed rate year debt to floating rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate 
the maturity date of the asset swaps is september with the remaining debt swaps maturing in february of as of september  and september   interest rate debt swaps had a weighted average receive rate of and  respectively 
the weighted average pay rate on the debt swaps was and as of september  and september   respectively

the unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income expense  net in the same period as the hedged transaction 
deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately million as of september  and million as of september  foreign currency risk overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  and probable but not firmly committed transactions 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures 
however  the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current assets and liabilities 
the premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings 
probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the company s products and purchases of raw material  sub assemblies  and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency 
a majority of these transactions are made through the company s subsidiaries in europe  asia particularly japan  canada  and australia 
the company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions 
the company also sells foreign exchange option contracts  in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts 
the term of the company s foreign exchange hedging instruments  whether for firmly committed transactions  probable but not firmly committed transactions  or to partially finance the foreign risk management program  currently does not extend beyond six months 
gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions
