allowance for loan and lease losses management maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance at a level it considers adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance is tested quarterly in the following manner 
reserve allocation percentages are developed for major portfolio segments 
for consumer loans  these percentages are based on historical losses by product type 
for commercial loans other than problem loans  they are based on historical losses by risk grade 
these percentages are multiplied by the dollar amount of outstanding loans in each portfolio segment 
the sum of these calculations is added to the sum of specific allocations for problem loans  to generate a first approximation of required reserves 
additional allocations are then considered for each specific portfolio segment based on any changes in circumstances that render historical loss percentages less predictive of future results 
finally  an unallocated portion is added for estimating error  based on then prevailing uncertainties that shape the future outlook for loss levels 
issues such as portfolio concentrations  entry into new markets  asset quality trends  off balance sheet risk exposures  and the outlook for change in economic conditions are considered 
this process for testing the adequacy of the allowance requires considerable judgment 
management s judgements are based on numerous assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of the company 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require the company to adjust its allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance totaled million  or of loans held for investment net of unearned income  at december   compared to million  or  at december  during the second quarter of  the allowance was decreased million as a consequence of the sale of the credit card portfolio 
the amount of the decrease equaled that portion of the allowance allocated to the credit card portfolio in the allowance model 
following the sale of the credit card portfolio  credit card receivables comprised of the company s december  loan portfolio  down from on december  the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was and as of december  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans increased to million as of december  from million at december  primarily due to the transfer of a million loan to nonaccrual status in the third quarter of see asset quality

asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as the company s interest sensitivity gap 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments  prepayment of principal and potential calls 
for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents principal cash flows based on management s judgement concerning their most likely runoff 
the actual maturities and runoff could vary substantially if future prepayments  runoff and calls differ from the company s historical experience and management s judgement 
interest sensitivity gap gap position measures the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities during a given time frame 
the company s gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is reviewed periodically to provide insights related to the static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position of million

the adjustment for repricing characteristics of variable rate loans adjusts the net contractual interest sensitive position for the immediate repricing of variable rate loans 
the contractual maturities are used for the net contractual interest sensitive position 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the company seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to have a significant impact on net interest income over time 
the company s asset liability committee uses a simulation model to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated on a periodic basis in order to obtain the most accurate forecast possible 
the forecast presents information over a twelve month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and reports variations that occur when rates increase and decrease basis points 
according to the model as of december   the company is positioned so that net interest income will increase million if interest rates rise in the next twelve months and will decrease million if interest rates decline in the next twelve months 
the larger increase in net interest income when interest rates are increased basis points is due to the assumptions made regarding deposit repricings based on the company s experience 
in an increasing rate environment  the company assumes that deposits will not increase the full basis points whereas in a declining rate environment  it is assumed that deposit rates will decline the entire basis points 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates and loan prepayments  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
liquidity liquidity management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of the company both at the holding company level as well as at the subsidiary level 
the holding company and non banking subsidiaries of the company require cash for various operating needs  including general operating expenses  payment of dividends to shareholders  interest on borrowings  extensions of credit  business combinations and capital infusions into subsidiaries 
the primary source of liquidity for the company s holding company is dividends from the banking and non banking subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiary banks have cash flow requirements involving withdrawals of deposits  extensions of credit and payment of operating expenses 
the principal sources of funds for liquidity purposes for the subsidiary banks are customers deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  loan sales or securitizations  securities available for sale  maturities of securities  temporary investments and earnings 
the subsidiary banks liquidity is also enhanced by the ability to acquire new deposits through its established branch network of branches in south carolina and branches in florida as of december  the liquidity ratio is an indication of a company s ability to meet its short term funding obligations 
at december   the liquidity ratios for carolina first bank  carolina first bank  fsb  and citrus bank were approximately  and  respectively 
the liquidity needs of the subsidiary banks are a factor in developing their deposit pricing structure  deposit pricing may be altered to retain or grow deposits if deemed necessary 
the subsidiary banks have access to borrowing from the fhlb and maintain short term lines of credit from unrelated banks 
at december   unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaled approximately million with an outstanding balance of million 
at december   the subsidiary banks had unused short term lines of credit totaling approximately million which are withdrawable at the lender s option 
management believes that these sources are adequate to meet its liquidity needs

the system conversion began during the first quarter of asset quality a willingness to take credit risk is inherent in the decision to grant credit 
prudent risk taking requires a credit risk management system based on sound policies and control processes that ensure compliance with those policies 
the company s credit risk management system is defined by policies approved by the board of directors that govern the risk underwriting  portfolio monitoring  and problem loan administration processes 
adherence to underwriting standards is managed through a multi layered credit approval process and immediate after the fact review by credit risk management of loans approved by lenders 
compliance with loan monitoring policies is managed through daily review by credit risk managers  monthly reviews of exception reports  and ongoing analysis of asset quality trends 
the administration of problem loans is driven by policies that require written plans for resolution and quarterly meetings with credit risk management to review progress 
credit risk management activities  including specific reviews of new large credits  are reviewed by the directors credit committees of each banking subsidiary  which meet monthly 
subsequent to year end  a new credit audit function was launched to provide management and the board of directors a more comprehensive independent review of compliance with credit policy both at the city office level and at the credit risk management level 
the results of these credit audits  which focus on testing for compliance with credit policies and procedures  are reported to the directors credit committees of the banking subsidiaries 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and foreclosed property totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
nonperforming assets increased to million as of december  from million at december  primarily due to the transfer of a million loan to nonaccrual status in the third quarter of this loan is a participation in a shared national credit 
it is not delinquent and  based on current facts and circumstances  management believes repayment in full is possible 
however  recent developments justify this change in status  and reserves sufficient to absorb potential loss have been allocated to the loan 
in connection with this syndicated national credit  carolina first bank filed a lawsuit in august in us district court in the southern district on new york against banque paribas  the lead bank on this syndicated credit 
this lawsuit seeks  among other things  an order requiring banque paribas to purchase carolina first bank s participation in the credit 
carolina first bank s claim is based on agreements between carolina first bank and banque paribas which require carolina first bank s participation to be purchased under certain circumstances  which carolina first bank believes have occurred 
although carolina first bank believes it should prevail in this lawsuit  the outcome cannot be predicted 
as discussed under equity investments  the company makes loans to companies that have a bank related technology or service the company or its subsidiaries can use
