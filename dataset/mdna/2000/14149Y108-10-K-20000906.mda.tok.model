the slight decrease in the operating revenues for the automation and information services segment in fiscal as compared to was primarily due to timing of customers purchases related to the year fiscal operating revenue growth was a result of general increases in customer demand as well as customers purchasing products early in anticipation of the year this segment continues to have strong demand for its new pharmacy automation products from the domestic hospital sector and non acute care customers 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries made to customers warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of pharmaceutical products 
fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that are beyond the control of the company  including consolidation within the customers industries  decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue warehousing activities  and changes in policies by manufacturers related to selling directly to customers 
due to the lack of margin generated through bulk deliveries  fluctuations in their amount have no significant impact on the company s earnings 
gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue years ended june pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical surgical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company the overall decrease in gross margin in and was due primarily to a greater mix of lower margin pharmaceutical distribution in and as compared to the prior years 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment represented of operating revenues  up from and of and operating revenues  respectively

offsetting this decrease was an increase in vendor incentives and a positive impact related to the rationalization program for the pharmacy management business see discussion in operating revenues 
the decrease in the medical surgical products and services segment s gross margin in was due to increased pricing pressures in certain self manufactured product lines  including the exam glove business  as well as a slight shift in revenue growth towards lower margin distributed products

these acquired businesses have a higher selling  general and administrative expense rate than the medical surgical products and services segment s normal rate  resulting in an increase during fiscal compared to the and overall growth in selling  general and administrative expenses experienced in fiscal years and  respectively  was due primarily to increases in personnel costs and depreciation expense  and compares favorably to the and growth in operating revenue for the same periods

there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  the company would incur additional merger related costs

provision for income taxes
