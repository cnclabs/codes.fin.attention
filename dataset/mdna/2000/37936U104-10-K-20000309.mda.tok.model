overview from our inception until  we focused on providing telecommunications services in emerging markets  particularly in russia and central europe and establishing and developing global telesystems europe bv gts europe bv  formerly known as hermes europe railtel bv  our subsidiary which deployed the first high speed fiber optic network across western europe and provides a range of bandwidth and internet protocol services to traditional and emerging communications companies 
after our initial public offering in february  we adapted our strategy to address the effects of the economic crisis in emerging markets  particularly russia  the emergence of the internet protocol as a widely accepted transport protocol and the deregulation of the provision of telecommunications services to end users in western europe 
we sought to build on the success of our pan european fiber optic network by developing a plan to provide telecommunications services directly to businesses and other end users 
accordingly  in late and in  we acquired four companies that provided such services to businesses and other high usage customers in western europe global telesystems europe limited gts europe ltd  formerly esprit telecom group plc  netsource  omnicom and intouch 
in addition  in order to position ourselves as a tier internet service provider in europe and target the higher growth european internet market  we acquired ebone 
the former ebone  gts europe ltd  netsource  omnicom and intouch businesses are now included in our operations 
these acquisitions have provided us with a significant business customer base and sales and distribution network across western europe  as well as switches  routers and other infrastructure  and  combined with our central european operations  position us to offer an expanded service portfolio of data  internet and other business applications to our business customers 
on september   we contributed all of our russian and cis operations to a newly formed subsidiary  golden telecom  inc  which effected an initial public offering of its common stock on october  we currently own approximately of the common stock of golden telecom 
business strategy our goal is to become europe s premier independent e business services provider and to maintain and enhance our position as a leading pan european provider of broadband  internet  data and voice services to communications carriers  internet service providers and other high usage customers 
in order to achieve this goal  we will build on the strengths of our pan european broadband fiber optic network  our pan european ip backbone and our position as a leading supplier of communications services to businesses  with a sales and distribution network spanning cities in european countries 
the key elements of our strategy for achieving these goals are as follows expand our services portfolio to support the communications and e business activities of our customers  leverage our business services distribution network to further penetrate our existing customer base and reach new customers  build on our leadership position in the carriers carrier market to penetrate a broader bandwidth intensive customer base  continue to invest in the reach and capacity of our fiber optic network  build infrastructure and extend our network closer to our customers by  expanding and enhancing the transatlantic capacity of our network and build or deploy data and web hosting centers to support web based services

our consolidated revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of revenue for the year ended december  were europe million and golden telecom million 
revenue for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of europe million and golden telecom million 
the growth in revenue in europe was primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base  the expansion of our network and the resulting increased traffic in all of our operations and acquisitions completed during the year 
additional contributors to the revenue growth in are as follows within golden telecom  we followed the consolidation method of accounting for certain business ventures  whereas in the first half of  these business ventures were accounted for following the equity method of accounting 
access and network services 
our access and network costs consist of costs associated with providing telecommunications services through our network and the costs of leased capacity 
during these costs increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the slight decrease in these costs as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to the growth in our customer revenue which was partially offset by increased settlement and interconnect costs paid to third parties and direct network operating and maintenance costs 
we are continuing to incur substantial capital and operating costs related to the implementation of our business strategy  including the expansion our network with which we expect to better serve our customer needs 
we expect that these investments will increase our operating efficiency thereby lowering our unit costs going forward 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the growth in our revenue base and our efforts to integrate our business operations and eliminate redundant costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in is attributable to the following additional expenses related to acquired entities  increases in payroll  related costs from the recruitment and hiring of additional staff associated with business growth  an increase in our sales and marketing efforts  additional building rent expense related to the increased office space due to growth in the company s infrastructure  increased administrative costs required for our increased customer base and the development of the company s new brand identity 
we expect to establish sales offices in additional european cities  which involves incurring substantial start up costs 
however  we expect to improve our effectiveness and leverage these expenses as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million or of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the substantial increase in depreciation and amortization costs is attributable to the depreciation related to the expansion of our network infrastructure that we have undertaken over the past several years 
additionally  we have experienced an increase in amortization expense associated with goodwill that has resulted from our acquisition activities 
the company expects that depreciation expense will continue to increase in subsequent periods as the company s network expansion efforts continue 
merger and restructuring costs 
during  we recorded a million charge to earnings attributable to merger and restructuring costs 
of the million  million  million and million was recorded in the first quarter  third quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the million first quarter charge was attributable to the transactional costs associated with the acquisition and integration of gts europe ltd 
formerly esprit telecom plc 
of the million  million remains as an accrual at december  the million third quarter charge was a result of our decision that the allocation of sufficient resources to support certain of our cellular ventures in russia was not consistent with our current strategic plans 
accordingly  we decided to abandon certain cellular ventures and decided to cease to provide any further financial assistance to these ventures other than the assumption of certain debt obligations 
we are seeking to sell our ownership interests in these assets in furtherance of our plan of abandonment 
of the million  million remains as an accrual  at december   for cash payments that we expect to incur as part of our plan of abandonment 
the million fourth quarter charge reflects a charge of million for the integration and rationalization of our switched voice assets as well as million for certain employee reorganization and severance costs 
these charges were principally a result of the acquisitions and organizational consolidations that we effected in of the million  million remains as an accrual  at december   for additional cash payments that we expect to incur as part of our plan of restructuring 
in we recorded a million extraordinary charge to earnings resulting from the early extinguishment of debt obligations 
the nature of the charge is comprised of the write off of million of unamortized debt discount and million of unamortized debt issuance costs that were deferred as financing costs and were being amortized over the original maturity of the debt obligations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately million in from million in this significant increase in interest expense is attributable to the substantial increase in our outstanding debt obligations during  see liquidity and capital resources below  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest resulting from the construction of the company s network 
we had outstanding debt obligations of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income for increased to million from million in this increase was due to the interest earned through our short term investment of the proceeds received from our financing activities 
foreign currency loss 
we recognized foreign currency losses of million in as compared to million in the losses in are primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our unhedged debt obligations 
the losses in were attributable to the devaluation of the russian ruble and losses on several forward exchange contracts and the weakening of the us dollar versus european currencies in the third and fourth quarters of year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
our consolidated revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of revenue for the year ended december  were europe million and golden telecom million 
revenue for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of europe million and golden telecom million

additionally  we experienced an increase in amortization expense associated with goodwill that has arisen from our acquisition activities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately million in from million in this significant increase in interest expense is attributable to the substantial increase in our outstanding debt obligations during interest income 
interest income for increased to million from million in this increase was due to the interest we earned through our short term investments that has grown  due to the proceeds of our financing activities 
foreign currency loss 
we recognized foreign currency losses of million in as compared to million in the losses in were attributable to the devaluation of the russian ruble and losses on several forward exchange contracts and the weakening of the us dollar versus european currencies in the third and fourth quarters of liquidity and capital resources corporate the telecommunications industry is capital intensive 
in order for us to successfully compete  we will require substantial capital to continue to develop our telecommunications networks  implement our e business strategy and meet the funding requirements of our operations  including losses from operations  as well as to provide capital for our acquisition and business development initiatives 
we currently expect that during the year  we will incur between million and million in capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  to implement our current strategic capital expenditure plan  including the transatlantic capacity participation discussed below 
we are participating in the construction and operation of the flag atlantic transoceanic cable through our interest in the flag atlantic limited joint venture 
we have agreed pursuant to the terms of the joint venture to invest million for our interest in the venture  which is to be paid in october and purchase capacity on the fiber cable for million 
as of december  we had paid million for this capacity and will pay the remaining million at a rate of million per quarter from january to june in january  gts europe bv issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and e million approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in november  gts europe bv issued e million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and e million senior notes due these new senior notes have substantially the same terms as the senior notes gts europe bv issued in january and august a subsidiary of our held gts europe bv subsidiary  is currently engaged in negotiations for a new credit facility the new credit facility with one or more institutional lenders in an aggregate amount of e million which we expect to close by the end of the second quarter of borrowings under the new credit facility would be structurally senior to the senior notes sold in august  january and november by gts europe bv we believe that the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes mentioned above  and borrowings under the new credit facility  combined with our existing cash balances and projected internally generated funds  should be sufficient to fund our currently identified capital expenditures  at least through december   including capital expenditures and payments on the long term fiber lease arrangements on our gts europe bv network 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing in the future 
additionally  as our business strategy evolves  we continuously evaluate the optimal capital structure to ensure that it meets our overall corporate strategy 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates 
in particular  the accuracy of our estimates is subject to changes and fluctuations in our revenues  operating costs and development expenses  which can be affected by our ability to effectively and efficiently manage the expansion of the gts europe bv network and operations and the build out of our city enterprise network infrastructure in our targeted metropolitan markets  implement our strategy to become a leading provider of e business services in europe  effectively and efficiently manage the build out of the flag atlantic transatlantic cable through our participation in the flag atlantic joint venture  obtain infrastructure contracts  rights of way  licenses  interconnection agreements and other regulatory approvals necessary to complete and operate the gts europe bv network  construct our city enterprise network infrastructure and implement data and web hosting capability in london  amsterdam  frankfurt  paris and other european cities  negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers  including large volume discounts on purchases of capital equipment and access markets  attract sufficient numbers of customers and provide and develop services for which customers will subscribe 
our revenues and costs are also dependent upon factors that are not within our control such as political  economic and regulatory changes  changes in technology  increased competition and various factors such as strikes  weather  and performance by third parties in connection with our operations 
due to the uncertainty of these factors  actual revenues and costs may vary from expected amounts  possibly to a material degree  and such variations are likely to affect our future capital requirements 
in addition  if we expand our operations at an accelerated rate or consummate acquisitions  our funding needs will increase  possibly to a significant degree  and we will expend our capital resources sooner than currently expected 
as a result of the foregoing  or if our capital resources otherwise prove to be insufficient  we will need to raise additional capital to execute our current business plan and to fund expected operating losses  as well as to consummate future acquisitions and exploit opportunities to expand and develop our businesses 
liquidity analysis we had cash and cash equivalents of billion and million as of december  and  respectively 
we had restricted cash of million and million as of december  and  respectively  that represents amounts held in escrow for debt interest payments and amounts to be paid in connection with the flag atlantic limited joint venture 
in  and  we used cash of million  million and million  respectively  for our operating activities 
the significant increase in cash spending for our operations in and is attributable to the growth of our business operations which has resulted in higher operating cash costs and accounts receivable carrying balances 
we also used cash of million  million and million for our investing activities in  and  respectively 
of the million of investing activities  million of cash was spent on business acquisitions and million of cash was spent primarily on building our telecommunications networks 
in investing activities included million spent on business acquisitions and million spent on building our telecommunications network as compared to million and million in  respectively 
we cannot assure you that our operations will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
if we cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations or working capital requirements 
substantially all of our operations are in western europe and therefore our consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our operations transact their business in the following significant currencies british pound sterling  the russian ruble and the euro 
for those operating companies that transact their business in currencies that are not readily convertible  we attempt to minimize our exposure by indexing our invoices and collections to the applicable dollar foreign currency exchange rate to the extent our costs including interest expense  capital expenditures and equity are incurred in us dollars 
although we are attempting to match revenues  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  losses and a resulting negative impact on earnings with respect to holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which include foreign currency devaluations against the us dollar 
furthermore  certain of our operations have notes payable and notes receivable which are denominated in a currency other than their own functional currency or loans linked to the us dollar 
we may also experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings related to these monetary assets and liabilities 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk 
we are currently evaluating the materiality of foreign exchange exposures in different countries and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
our ability to hedge our exposure is limited since certain of our operations are located in countries whose currencies are not easily convertible 
financial hedge instruments for these countries are nonexistent or limited and also pricing of these instruments is often volatile and not always efficient 
we designed and implemented reporting processes to monitor the potential exposure on an ongoing basis in we will use the output of this process to execute financial hedges to cover foreign exchange exposure when practical and economically justified 
in april  we consummated a foreign exchange swap transaction to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure resulting from the issuance of million senior notes issued by gts europe bv year compliance we initiated a year compliance program during to address the risks associated with the year issue and to avoid material loss or impact to us or our customers due to these risks 
we experienced no substantial problems relating to the year issues 
we incurred approximately million in costs  million of which we incurred during  to ensure that business would continue without incident after december  we continue to monitor all of our systems and have accrued a minimal amount to cover costs that we expect during the first quarter of we believe that any and all additional year issues or concerns that may arise will be addressed and corrected by march  impact of the euro in accordance with the treaty on eu  signed at maastricht on february   stage iii of the economic and monetary union emu commenced on january   and a single currency  the euro e  has been introduced 
in addition on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union  including belgium  the netherlands  ireland  france  germany  italy and spain established an irrevocable fixed conversion rate between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the euro exists in parallel with national currencies  and transactions may be denominated in either currency until december  though only notes and coins of the national currencies will be available for physical exchange 
from january   euro notes and coins will be introduced and national currencies will be withdrawn by june  those participating member states have also transferred authority for conducting monetary policy to the european central bank 
through certain of our subsidiaries we have significant operations within the eu  including many of the countries that adopted the euro 
we are currently evaluating the system issues raised by the adoption of the euro  including preparing business systems for trading in euros and converting the accounting systems of companies in the common currency area from their national currency to euros  the benefit of the elimination of exchange rate risk in cross border transactions within the common currency area  the potential impact of increases in pricing transparency on price differentials between member states  and training and human resources issues 
we are also currently evaluating the impact the euro will have on our continuing business operations and no assurances can be given that the euro will not have material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  we do not expect the euro to have a material effect on our competitive position as a result of price transparency within the european union as we have always operated as a pan european business with transparent pricing in ecu for the majority of our customers 
moreover  we are evaluating our ability to update our information systems to accommodate the adoption of the euro but we do not expect to incur material costs in either the evaluating or the updating of such systems 
in addition  we cannot accurately predict the impact the euro will have on currency exchange rates or on our currency exchange risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our treasury function manages our funding  liquidity  and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
our treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorized by our board of directors 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any transactions of a speculative nature 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term obligations and as a global company  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
a portion of our debt obligations are denominated in currencies which expose us to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk and periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
our subsidiary  gts europe bv  has entered into a foreign currency swap agreement in order to mitigate our exposure on us dollar denominated debt 
we also attempt to mitigate this and other exposures from debt obligations denominated in exposed currencies by maintaining assets in the exposed currency wherever possible 
we find it impractical to hedge all foreign currency exposure and as a result will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses
