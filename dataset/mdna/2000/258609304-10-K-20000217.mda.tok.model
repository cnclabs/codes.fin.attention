overview we are a leading provider of technology driven marketing and advertising solutions to thousands of advertisers  advertising agencies  web publishers and e commerce merchants worldwide 
we provide a broad range of media  technology and data products and services to our customers to allow them to optimize their ad and marketing campaigns on the internet and through other interactive media 
our patented dart technology is the platform for many of our solutions and enables our customers to use preselected criteria to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time 
our service and product offerings are grouped into three segments doubleclick media media  doubleclick techsolutions technology  and doubleclick data services data 
comparability of results altavista agreement in january  we changed the manner in which we report the financial results of the services we perform for the altavista web site 
effective january   we entered into an advertising services agreement with altavista company s predecessor in interest compaq computer corporation that superceded the previously effective procurement and trafficking agreement  dated december and amended in january  between doubleclick and compaq computer corporation s predecessor in interest  digital equipment corp 
until december   we had paid altavista a service fee under the procurement and trafficking agreement which was calculated as a percentage of the revenues earned from advertisers for the delivery of advertisements to users of the altavista web site 
under that agreement  we recognized as revenues the gross amount earned for advertising delivered to users of the altavista web site 
gross amounts billed by us  including amounts billed on behalf of altavista  are referred to as system revenues  and are presented solely to facilitate the comparison of our and results of operations 
beginning january   altavista agreed  pursuant to the advertising services agreement  to use our dart technology for ad delivery  and to outsource domestic  international and local ad sales functions to us 
for these services  altavista pays us a technology fee for all advertising delivered by our dart technology to users of the altavista web site  a sales commission based on the net revenues generated from all advertisements sold by doubleclick on behalf of altavista and a fee for all billing and collections services we perform for altavista 
under the new agreement  we recognize dart service fees  sales commissions and billing and collection fees as revenues derived from the sale and delivery of impressions on the altavista web site and associated services 
as a result of this change in our relationship with altavista  although there has been no significant change in gross profit dollars  overall gross margin percentage has increased as we are no longer required to pay service fees to altavista for impressions sold and delivered on the altavista web site and revenues include the fees earned for services rendered 
the advertising services agreement expires on january   subject to prior termination in limited circumstances or further extension in accordance with the terms of the altavista advertising services agreement 
in november  we entered into an interim advertising services agreement  effective from november  through december  with altavista  which temporarily suspends the advertising services agreement 
the interim services agreement temporarily adjusts some advertising sales arrangements between us and altavista  but does not change the manner in which we recognize revenues derived from our services for the altavista web site 
in january  upon the expiration of the interim services agreement  the advertising services agreement will once again be effective 
business combinations we consummated mergers with netgravity  abacus and opt in email 
com during  which have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method and accordingly  the financial results for all periods presented have been restated 
we acquired the remaining interests not previously owned by us in doubleclick scandinavia ab in december and doubleclick iberoamerica sl in november these transactions were accounted for under the purchase method 
results of operations revenues and gross profit by segment are as follows revenues gross profit year ended december  year ended december  in thousands media       technology       data       intersegment elimination    total       compared to revenues and gross profits increased over due primarily to volume increases both domestically and internationally and a favorable product mix  partially offset by declines resulting from the change in the manner in which we present revenues earned pursuant to the altavista advertising services agreement and in pricing of some of our technology products

revenues derived from advertising impressions delivered to the users of the altavista web site were million  or of total revenues  for  compared to million  or of total revenues  for as discussed above  we changed the manner in which we recognize revenue pursuant to the altavista advertising services agreement

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk

the introduction of the euro has not had a material impact on how we conduct business and we do not anticipate any changes in how we conduct business as a result of increased price transparency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors
