item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on loans and securities and the company s cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses  investment activities  loan origination  sale and servicing activities  service charges and fees collected on deposit accounts  and insurance services and fees 
noninterest expense primarily consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  marketing expenses  charitable contributions and other expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
analysis of financial condition overview total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  asset growth was realized primarily due to substantial loan growth of million 
the increase in the loan portfolio was funded with an additional million in borrowings  as well as a million  or increase in deposits 
similarly  total assets for the year ended december  increased from billion at december   primarily related to the proceeds generated from the offering 
lending activities the total loan portfolio increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase resulted from growth in all portfolios  but primarily in the one to four family residential and commercial real estate portfolios  which increased million and million  respectively  as the company continued to emphasize the expansion of its real estate lending activities 
as part of management s continued asset liability management efforts  particular emphasis was placed on the origination of one to four family residential adjustable rate and bi weekly mortgage loans which represented of the residential real estate loan closings 
in addition  approximately million of the residential growth is attributable to the repurchase of mortgages originally sold to the savings bank life insurance fund fund 
these mortgages were repurchased as a result of the reorganization of the fund 
additionally  as a result of the company s continued focus on indirect lending products  total consumer loans increased to million for the year ended december   primarily in the recreational vehicle and automobile portfolios  which represented of the total consumer loans originated for the same period 
during  the company also established a small business lending unit that resulted in a  or million increase in commercial business loans  primarily in lines of credit and the purchase of small ticket equipment leases 
the company s focus on lending activities was also evident in as real estate loans increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily in the one to four family residential and commercial real estate portfolios  which increased million and million  respectively  during this increase was reflective of the company s emphasis on the expansion of its real estate lending activities  the development of indirect lending products  primarily recreational vehicle and automobile loans  as well as increased refinancing activity driven by the declining interest rates throughout the year 
the loan growth during the last two years has been achieved without compromising the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio 
at december   the company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total non performing loans increased to  compared to and at december  and december  non performing loans decreased from million and million at december  and  respectively to million at december  at december   the company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was compared to and at december  and  respectively 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future credit loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require the company to recognize additional provisions based on their judgement of information available to them at the time of their examination 
investing activities the company s securities available for sale portfolio decreased slightly from million at december  to million at december  the company purchased million of investment and mortgage related securities during approximately  million of cmos with three to ten year weighted average lives were purchased as part of the company s leveraging strategy utilizing fhlb advances with comparable maturities 
approximately million in securities purchases were primarily in one to three year weighted average life asset backed securities backed by home equity loans  us agency bonds and equity securities 
these purchases were funded with million in mortgage related securities prepayments  which were accelerated by the lower interest rate environment during the first half of the remaining prepayments were utilized to fund the expanding loan portfolio 
during  the increase in the securities available for sale portfolio reflects the investing of funds primarily in one to three year weighted average life asset backed securities and two to four year weighted average life cmos in the mortgage related securities portfolio which were deemed to offer reduced interest rate risk and more consistent cash flows in the low interest rate environment 
the flat interest rate yield curve was also the primary factor behind the increase in federal funds sold as rates earned on these short term investments were comparable to those of longer term securities that were subject to greater interest rate risk 
this increase in these securities was offset by the maturities of million of money market preferred stock in the held to maturity portfolio whose yields declined below those of federal funds 
other activities during  the company redeployed its significant december  federal funds sold position primarily into higher yielding loan portfolios and other investment vehicles  such as the wha acquisition and the purchase of an additional million purchase of bank owned life insurance 
additionally  the company purchased million in fhlb stock related to the increased borrowings 
funding activities the company s borrowed funds increased from million at december  to million at december  during the company continued a borrowing reinvestment program initially begun in as management identified an opportunity to utilize borrowings to lock in lower cost funding  better match its assets and liabilities  while leveraging its increased capital position 
using fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements  the rates paid on these additional borrowings range from to with varying maturities extending through total deposits at december  were billion  an increase of million compared to billion at december  the impact of the continued lower interest rate yield curve during the first nine months of was reflected in the shift of deposit balances from longer term certificates of deposit  which decreased million  into the company s competitively priced money market deposit account first introduced in june of balances in these money market accounts grew million during total deposits grew million during from million at december   primarily in the money market demand accounts 
equity activities stockholders equity decreased to million at december  from million at december  despite net income of million  the decrease was primarily attributable to the repurchase of  shares of treasury stock as part of capital management buy back programs approved for total repurchases of  shares 
the purchases were made at an average cost of per share 
in addition  as a result of the increase in overall interest rates during the latter part of  the market value of the company s available for sale investment portfolio decreased million  net of applicable taxes  during the year 
stockholders equity increased during from million at december   primarily due to the proceeds generated from the offering and an increase in the unrealized gain on the company s available for sale securities portfolio  as well as earnings of million

the return on average equity in was compared to in  excluding the one time contribution 
the increase in the return on average equity in was enhanced by the impact of treasury stock repurchases 
net interest income net interest income  which is impacted by changes in the composition of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates and spreads  increased to million in from million in this was mainly the result of the growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or to billion in from billion in interest income on loans increased to million for the period from million for the same period in the increase resulted from a increase in average loans outstanding during compared to the same period in  the benefits of which more than offset a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans over the same periods 
interest income on investment and mortgage related securities in the available for sale portfolio increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  resulting from a million increase in the average balance of these securities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on these investments 
interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on deposits offset a million increase in the average balances 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  as a result of significant additional borrowings used to fund the loan growth 
the net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the narrowing of the margin resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average interest rate spread to in from in the decrease in the average interest rate spread  or the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  reflects the general decline in market yields early in on average interest earning assets and the additional funding costs of borrowed funds  as well as interest bearing checking accounts  primarily money market demand accounts  which carry a market based cost of funds that is slightly higher than the other interest bearing liabilities of the company 
the decline in the average interest rate spread was partially offset by a increase in average net interest earning assets when comparing the two periods 
provision for credit losses reflecting the growth in the loan portfolio  specifically in higher risk categories such as commercial real estate  commercial loans and indirect consumer loans  the provision for credit losses increased to million in compared to million in the company establishes provisions for credit losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level sufficient to absorb future charge offs of loans deemed non collectable 
however  the quality of the portfolio remained high during net charge offs for totaled  compared to million in  with net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreasing to in from in the provision is based on management s quarterly assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses with consideration given to such interrelated factors as the composition and inherent risk within the loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans and charge offs  both current and historic economic conditions  as well as current trends related to regulatory supervision 
based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased to million in from million in several factors  primarily the acquisition of the insurance subsidiaries and the implementation of various treasury initiatives  furthered the company s efforts to be less reliant on net interest income 
approximately  million of noninterest income was recognized during relating to the new insurance subsidiary activities 
additionally  premium income generated by a newly implemented equity covered call option program  tax exempt earnings on bank owned life insurance  as well as increased commissions received from the sale of third party annuity and mutual fund products had a positive impact on the year to date noninterest income 
the company s focus on generating core checking accounts  fees associated with a revised relationship checking account product  and continued growth in debit card usage also contributed to the increase in fee income 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million for the year ended december  reflecting an million increase over the year ended december  total of million 
included in the total was a one time expense of million related to funding the bank s charitable foundation 
approximately million of the noninterest expense for the year ended december  was attributable to the operation and acquisition of the insurance subsidiaries  primarily in salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  as well as goodwill amortization of million 
salaries and employee benefits were million in  an increase of million or from million in in addition to the insurance subsidiary costs  salaries and benefits increased due to newly implemented sales and incentive programs  new stock option award plans and increased staffing related to the expansion of the residential and commercial loan origination sales forces 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at december   up from at december   of which were in the insurance subsidiaries 
other increases relate to the company s ongoing upgrade of technology and communications systems  particularly the implementation of a home banking product in  expenses incurred for the opening of two new branch locations scheduled for opening in early  and professional and legal costs related to the analysis of potential acquisitions 
income taxes the effective tax rate increased to in from in  primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill related to the insurance subsidiary acquisition 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income net income in was million  or less than the million in this decrease resulted from the million one time contribution to fund the first niagara bank foundation  which consisted of million of the company s common stock and million of cash 
this contribution resulted in a million charge to earnings on an after tax basis 
excluding the effect of this contribution  the net income was million  or higher than net income 
net income represented a return on average assets in of  or excluding the one time contribution  compared to in the return on average equity in was  or excluding the one time contribution  compared to in the conversion and offering  which raised over million in additional capital  was the primary reason for the decrease in the return on average equity in net interest income the growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or to billion in from billion in  was a result of proceeds generated from the offering  as well as the increase in utilizing wholesale borrowings 
this increase was the primary factor that contributed to an increase in net interest income 
the growth in average interest earning assets in was primarily attributable to increases in average loans outstanding 
average loans totaled million in  up from million in reflective of the company s strategic focus on increasing loan originations 
the net interest spread was in  compared with in a slightly lower proportion of loans  which typically yield more than investment securities  in the composition of the interest earning asset portfolio  as well as the lower interest rate environment in resulted in the yield on interest earning assets decreasing to in from in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in due to lower prevailing interest rates and the effect of the new initiatives relating to borrowed funds and the money market deposit account 
interest free funds  consisting largely of noninterest bearing deposits and equity  contributed to the net interest margin in  compared with in average interest free funds were million in and million in largely due to the impact of interest free funds  the company s net interest margin was in  compared with in provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was million in  compared to million in net charge offs for were million  compared to million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding at in and in nonperforming loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding at december   compared to million or of loans at december  the allowance for credit losses was million or of total loans at the end of  compared to million or at december  noninterest income noninterest income increased to million in from million in banking service charges and fees increased to million in from million in increased customer usage of the debit card product  charges for insufficient funds on checking accounts  as well as a redesigned relationship checking product were the primary contributors to the increased income 
loan fees  which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing income  loan origination and underwriting fees  commercial mortgage prepayment penalties  and other residential and consumer loan related income increased to million in  from million in the low interest rate environment throughout contributed to increased refinancing activities in the residential and commercial mortgage portfolios  which resulted in significant increases in loan origination  underwriting and document preparation fees  along with commercial mortgage prepayment penalties 
all other noninterest income increased in due to insurance services and fees relating to the servicing of savings bank life insurance products  income earned on the sale of residential mortgages  recoveries on owned real estate  commissions on the sale of third party annuities and mutual funds  and other investments such as bank owned life insurance all contributed to the increase in other noninterest income during noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million in  up from million in included in the total was the one time charge of million related to funding the bank s charitable foundation 
salaries and employee benefits were million in  an increase of million or from million in the increase was primarily the result of three new branch offices opened in  expansion of the residential real estate function  costs associated with the employee stock ownership plan and normal merit salary increases 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at december   up from at december  all other noninterest expenses  excluding salaries and employee benefits and charitable contributions  totaled million in  up from million in the increase in all other noninterest expenses in from was primarily attributable to increased occupancy and equipment costs which resulted from the new branch offices and the company s new administrative center which opened in the third quarter of  and costs associated with operating as a public company such as transfer agent fees  franchise taxes  and legal and professional expenses 
income taxes the effective tax rate decreased from in to in these decreases reflect the benefit of the implementation of various tax planning strategies during the second half of liquidity and capital resources in addition to the company s primary funding sources of deposits and borrowings  additional funding is provided from the principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from the maturities and sale of investment securities  as well as proceeds from the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows  mortgage prepayments  mortgage loan sales  and borrowings are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
accelerated principal repayments on mortgage related and other available for sale securities provided an additional source of liquidity  totaling million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other borrowings  as a result of the implementation of the company s asset liability and leveraging strategies  increased to million during the twelve month period ended december  compared to million for and million for the primary investing activities of the company are the origination of residential one to four family mortgages  commercial real estate loans  consumer loans  as well as the purchase of mortgage related and debt and equity securities 
during  loan originations totaled million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
purchases of mortgage related securities  primarily cmos  totaled million at december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
purchases of other available for sale securities  primarily short term asset backed and equity securities  during the years ended december   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
also during the first quarter  the company closed on the acquisition of wha  utilizing existing liquid assets and purchased million from sbli of one to four family residential mortgages funded by fhlb advances with similar maturities 
at december   outstanding loan commitments totaled million 
these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since certain of these instruments may expire without being funded and others may not be fully drawn upon 
it is anticipated that there will be sufficient funds available to meet the current loan commitments and other obligations 
cash  interest bearing demand accounts at correspondent banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements are the company s most liquid assets 
the level of these assets are monitored daily and are dependent on operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
excess short term liquidity is usually invested in overnight federal funds sold 
in the event that funds beyond those generated internally are required  additional sources of funds are available through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances 
as of december   the total of cash  interest bearing demand accounts  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreement was million  or of total assets 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this standard also requires an entity to establish a method  consistent with its approach to managing risk  that it will use to assess the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
this statement originally effective for fiscal years beginning after june  has been delayed to fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the adoption of this standard  at this time  will not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued an exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets  which addresses new rules governing the accounting for business combinations that will limit the accounting for all future acquisitions to the purchase method 
additionally  new restrictions are being proposed on the allowable amortization period of any related goodwill and purchased intangibles recognized as a result of a business combination 
the proposal also includes disclosure requirements that would include a cash basis earnings and earnings per share presentation that would exclude the impact of goodwill amortization and other intangibles on earnings 
since the company has accounted for all previous acquisitions using the purchase method and intends to use it for all acquisitions in process  the adoption of these new rules as they are being proposed  currently do not impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the board s approved guidelines to reduce the vulnerability of operations to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee is comprised of senior management and selected banking officers under the direction of the board  with senior management responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
in recent years  the company has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of residential monthly and bi weekly fixed rate mortgage loans having terms to maturity of not more than twenty years  residential and commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans  and consumer loans consisting primarily of mobile home loans  home equity loans  education loans  and more recently  recreational vehicle loans  selling substantially all newly originated year fixed rate  residential mortgage loans into the secondary market without recourse and on a servicing retained basis  and investing in shorter term securities which generally bear lower yields as compared to longer term investments  but which better position the company for increases in market interest rates 
during the latter stages of  the company began to retain some of the newly originated year fixed rate  residential mortgage loans in the portfolio and fund them with long term borrowings as long as an acceptable spread could be obtained 
shortening the maturities of the company s interest earning assets by increasing shorter term investments better matches the maturities of the company s deposit accounts  in particular its certificates of deposit that mature in one year or less  which  at december  totaled million  or of total interest bearing liabilities 
during  the company  on a limited basis  began entering into interest rate swap agreements with a third party to match more closely the repricing of its money market demand product 
the company intends to continue to analyze the future utilization of swap agreements as part of its overall asset liability management process 
these strategies may adversely impact net interest income due to lower initial yields on these investments in comparison to longer term  fixed rate loans and investments 
however  management believes that reducing the exposure to interest rate fluctuations will enhance long term profitability 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was a negative 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position is likely to experience a decline in net interest income as the cost of its interest bearing liabilities increase at a rate faster than its yield on interest earning assets 
in comparison  an institution with a positive gap is likely to realize an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
given the company s existing liquidity position and its ability to sell securities from its available for sale portfolio  management believes that its negative gap position will not have a material adverse effect on its operating results or liquidity position 
if interest rates decrease  there may be a positive effect on the company s interest rate spread and corresponding operating results 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the repricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
while the company believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  which restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
as a result of these shortcomings  the company focuses more attention on simulation modeling  such as the net income and portfolio value analysis discussed below  rather than gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within the company s targeted range of acceptable limits  the net income and net portfolio value simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income and economic value trends 
net income and portfolio value analysis 
the accompanying table as of december  and sets forth the estimated impact on the company s net income resulting from changes in the interest rates during the next twelve months 
these estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage related investment prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates  and deposit maturities and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market condition 
calculated increase decrease at december  december  net net changes in portfolio portfolio interest rates net income value net income value dollars in thousands basis points    basis points    basis points  basis points    as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in net income and npv requires the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net income and npv table presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net income and npv table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results
