our principal products are individual fixed  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies that consist of nursing home care  home health care  medicare supplement and long term disability insurance 
our underwriting practices rely upon the base of experience  which we have developed over years of providing nursing home care insurance  as well as upon available industry and actuarial information 
as the home health care market has developed  we have encouraged the purchase of both nursing home care and home health care coverage  and have introduced new life insurance products as well  thus providing policyholders with enhanced protection while broadening our policy base 
in late  we introduced our personal freedom plan and assisted living plan 
both plans are designed to provide comprehensive nursing home and home health care coverage 
during  we developed our secured risk nursing facility and post acute recovery plans  which provide limited benefits to higher risk applicants 
long term nursing home care and home health care policies accounted for approximately of our total annualized premiums in force as of december  and approximately of our consolidated revenues for our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of each state in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported losses  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
our results of operations are affected significantly by the following factors level of required reserves for policies in force 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
claim reserves reflect actual experience through the most recent time period and policy reserves reflect expectations of claims related to a block of business over its entire life 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust our reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
revisions to reserves are reflected in our current results of operations through benefits to policyholder s expense 
we also maintain reserves for policies that are not currently in claim based upon actuarial expectations that a policy may go on claim in the future 
these reserves are calculated based on factors that include estimates for mortality  morbidity  interest rates and persistency 
factor components generally include assumptions that are consistent with both our experience and industry practices 
policy premium levels 
we attempt to set premium levels to ensure profitability  subject to the constraints of competitive market conditions and state regulatory approvals 
premium levels are reviewed on new product filings  as well as for rate increases as claims experience warrants 
deferred acquisition costs 
in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amortize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses directly related to the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
deferred acquisition costs can be affected by unanticipated termination of policies because  upon such unanticipated termination  we are required to expense fully the deferred acquisition costs associated with the terminated policy 
the number of years a policy has been in effect 
claims costs tend to be higher on policies that have been in force for a longer period of time 
as the policy ages  it is more likely that the insured will need services covered by the policy 
however  the longer the policy is in effect  the more premium we will receive 
investment income 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade fixed income securities 
income generated from this portfolio is largely dependent upon prevailing levels of interest rates 
due to the longevity of our investment portfolio duration approximately years  investment interest income does not immediately reflect changes in market interest rates 
however  we are susceptible to changes in market rates when cash flows from maturing investments are reinvested at prevailing market rates 
as of december   approximately of our invested assets were committed to high quality large capitalization common stocks and preferred stocks of smaller corporations 
lapsation and persistency 
factors that affect our results of operations are lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies  and first year compared to renewal premiums 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by nonrenewal and  pursuant to our policy  is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue  however  policies may be reinstated  if approved  within six months after the policy lapses 
persistency represents the percentage of premiums renewed  which we calculate by dividing the total annual premiums at the end of each year less first year business for that year by the total annual premiums in force for the prior year 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in total annual premiums in force at the end of any year would be a result of non renewal of policies  including those policies that have terminated by reason of death  lapse due to nonpayment of premiums  and or conversion to other policies offered by us 
first year premiums are premiums covering the first twelve months a policy is in force 
renewal premiums are premiums covering all subsequent periods 
policies renew or lapse for a variety of reasons  due both to internal and external causes 
we believe that our efforts to address any policyholder concerns or questions in an expedient fashion help to ensure ongoing policy renewal 
we also believe that we enjoy a favorable policyholder reputation for providing desirable policy benefits  minimal premium rate increases and efficient claims processing 
we work closely with our licensed agents  who play an integral role in policy conservation and policyholder communication 
external factors also contribute to policy renewal or lapsation 
economic cycles can influence a policyholder s ability to continue the payment of insurance premiums when due 
new government legislative initiatives have raised public awareness of the escalating costs of long term care  which we believe boosts new sales and promotes renewal payments 
recent initiatives also include tax relief for certain long term care insurance coverage  which promotes new and renewal payments 
lapsation and persistency can positively and adversely impact future earnings 
improved persistency generally results in higher renewal premium and reduced amortization of deferred acquisition costs than anticipated 
however  higher persistency may lead to increased claims in future periods 
additionally  increased lapsation can result in reduced premium collection  accelerated deferred acquisition cost amortization and anti selection of higher risk  remaining policyholders 
twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands  except per share data premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve month period ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  increased to  compared to  in the same period in during  we entered a reinsurance and administration transaction with an unaffiliated insurer the reinsurance transaction 
under the terms of the reinsurance transaction  we assumed  of first year and renewal long term care insurance in force under a quota share agreement 
excluding the impact of the reinsurance transaction  first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we attribute our growth to continued improvements in product offerings  which competitively meet the needs of the long term care marketplace  and expansion into new states  such as new jersey  connecticut and new york 
in addition  we have continued to actively recruit and train agents to sell our products 
when actuarially warranted  we have been generally successful in obtaining premium rate increases 
excluding the impact of the reinsurance transaction  renewal premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in this increase reflects renewals of a larger base of in force policies 
we also attribute this renewal growth to an increase in persistency from in to in renewals as a percentage of total prior year business 
net investment income 
net investment income earned for increased to  from  for management attributes this growth to more invested assets as a result of higher established reserves 
investment income is reduced  however  by our use of invested cash for the acquisition of united insurance group on january  our average yield on invested balances was in  compared to in net realized capital gains 
during  we recognized capital gains of  compared to gains of  in during  we recorded gains of approximately  from the sale of a portion of our equities securities portfolio 
these gains were recognized as a result of our desire to offset the net income impact of our recorded expense attributable to the impairment of fixed assets 
in february  we recognized approximately  of capital gains from the sale of substantially all of our equities securities portfolio 
following both the and substantive sales  we replenished our equities securities portfolio in subsequent market purchases 
the remainder of the gains in both periods was recorded as a result of our normal investment management operations 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during  up from in the increase is attributable to the inclusion of commissions earned by united insurance group on sales of insurance products underwritten by unaffiliated insurers 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in increased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in under the reinsurance transaction  we established policy and claim reserves of  for which we received cash from the reinsured party 
the establishment of the reserves is included in as benefits to policyholders 
policyholder benefits include additions to reserves and claims payments for policyholders incurring claims in the current and prior years 
in  we paid  related to current year incurrals and  related to claims incurred in and prior years 
in  we paid  for current year claims and  related to prior year incurrals 
paid claims as a percentage of premiums were in  compared to in we anticipate that as policies age  and new premium as a percentage of total premium decreases  this paid ratio will increase 
in the year in which a claim is first incurred  we establish reserves that are actuarially determined to be the present value of all future payments required for that claim 
we assume that our current reserve amount and interest income earned on invested reserves will be sufficient to make all future payments 
we measure the validity of our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period ie  incurred from prior years 
this amount   and  in and  respectively  includes imputed interest from prior year end reserve balances of  and  respectively  plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments  particularly as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance  yield a relative measure of deviation in actual performance to our initial assumptions 
in  we added approximately  or of prior year end reserves to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
in  we added approximately  or of prior year end reserves to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
while we do not believe that either or additions represent material deviation from our estimates  we note that claims development has exceeded our expectations in both periods 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
when we experience deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that are sufficient to offset future deviation 
we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for these increases when deemed to be actuarially sound 
commissions 
commissions to agents increased to  in  compared to  in commissions in include a one time ceding allowance of  which we paid to an unaffiliated third party under the reinsurance transaction 
excluding the impact of the reinsurance transaction and from the inclusion of united insurance group  which serves to reduce commissions by  from policies that we underwrite  first year commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  corresponding to the increase in first year accident and health premiums and to the issuance of younger age policies  which typically pay a higher first year commission rate 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in renewal commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  consistent with the increase in renewal premiums discussed above 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in net policy acquisition costs deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in increased to  compared to  in deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  with the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commission rate less renewal commission rates  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy underwriting 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
during  we recognized  in expense due to the amortization of prior and current deferred policy acquisition costs 
we amortized  in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in general and administrative expenses include united insurance group expense of  including of goodwill amortization 
while the remaining expense has grown over with overall premium growth  management believes that current cost savings initiatives  such as remote office consolidation and outsourcing of certain administrative functions  will reduce this growth in the future 
loss due to impairment of property and equipment 
during the second quarter  we determined to discontinue our planned implementation of our lifepro computer system 
at that time  we had capitalized  of expenditures related to this project  including licensing costs and fees paid to outside parties for system development and implementation 
as the system was not yet placed in service  none of these costs had previously been depreciated on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
upon determining not to utilize these fixed assets  their value became fully impaired and we recognized the entire amount as current period expense 
provision for federal income taxes 
our provision for federal income taxes for decreased to  compared to  for the effective tax rates of and in and  respectively  are below the normal federal corporate rate as a result of credits from the small life insurance company deduction  as well as our investments in tax exempt bonds and from dividends received that are partially exempt from taxation  which are partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization 
comprehensive income 
during  our investment portfolio generated pre tax  unrealized losses of  due to increased market interest rates  compared to period unrealized gains of  after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity increased by  from comprehensive income during  compared to comprehensive income of  in twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands  except per share data premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve month period ended december   including long term care disability  life and medicare supplement increased to  compared to  in the same period in first year long term care premiums in increased to  compared to  in we attribute our growth to continued improvements in product offerings that competitively meet the needs of the long term care marketplace 
in addition  we actively recruit and train agents to sell our products 
renewal long term care premiums in increased to  compared to  in this increase reflects higher persistency and growth of in force premiums 
persistency in was  compared to in in addition  american network  which we acquired on august   generated disability premiums of  during  down from  recognized in net investment income 
net investment income for increased to  from  for  which is a result of higher invested assets achieved through cash receipts from premiums  with corresponding reserve increases 
during  we sold our entire equity securities portfolio  or approximately  of invested assets 
from this sale  we recognized an approximate  capital gain 
we subsequently reestablished our equities portfolio in future periods 
also  we liquidated our tax exempt bond holdings in order to recognize higher tax equivalent yields 
this sale generated an approximate  gain 
we recognized  of capital gains in our average yield on invested assets and cash balances was in  compared to in benefits to policyholders 
benefits to policyholders in increased to  compared to  in accident and health benefits to policyholders in increased to  compared to  in the loss ratio for accident and health business was  compared to in in we added approximately  to our reservs as a result of our reassessment of assumptions utilized in the actuarial determination of reserves for current reserves 
this resulted in a higher loss ratio for the remaining growth in benefits is attributable to new premium growth 
management expects the loss ratio to increase with time due to the impact of a maturing portfolio 
also  due to our policy of discounting reserves  reserve releases will typically be less than actual claims payments 
management believes that interest earnings from invested assets will be sufficient to offset the difference between claims payments and reserve releases 
commissions 
commissions to agents increased to  in compared to  in commissions expense includes american network commissions on long term disability policies  which generated  of expenses in first year commissions on total accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  corresponding to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in the commission ratio increased in as a result of the increased sale of policies to younger individuals 
we pay higher first year commissions on younger policies due to our expectation that these policies will generate revenues for more years than at older issue ages 
first year commissions on life business in decreased to  compared to in  directly reflecting our reduction in first year life premiums 
the ratio of first year life commissions to first year life premiums was in compared to in due to an increase in single premium policies sold 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  remaining consistent with the increase in renewal premiums discussed above 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in this ratio fluctuates in relation to the age of the policies in force and the rates of commissions paid to the producing agents 
net policy acquisition costs deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to higher commission rates paid for first year premiums as a result of the sale of younger age policies  which pay a higher commission percentage in the first year 
this deferral is net of amortization  which decreases or increases as our actual persistency is higher or lower than the persistency assumed for reserving purposes 
the deferral of policy acquisition costs has remained consistent with the growth of premiums  and the growth in amortization of policy acquisition costs has been modified by improved persistency 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in general and administrative expenses  excluding goodwill and convertible debt cost amortization  as a percentage of premiums were in  compared to in net income 
net income of  for was  or above income of  net income includes income tax provisions of  and  for the and periods  respectively 
income before federal income taxes increased in by  or to  this increase was primarily attributable to premium growth and capital gains realized from bond and equity sales 
we made a provision for federal income taxes of  reflecting an effective rate of  as compared to an effective tax rate of 
comprehensive income 
during  our investment portfolio generated increases in unrealized gains of  compared to gains of  after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity increased by  from comprehensive income during  compared to  in  or an increase of  or 
new accounting principles in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
as relates to the imbedded option value of our investments in convertible bonds 
statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop was issued by the american institute of certified public accountants in march and provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the statement is effective for financial statements 
the adoption of sop has not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
year amounts in thousands as many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the year  they may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities may be at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue can arise at any point in our supply  billing  processing  sales or financial chains 
we implemented a yk readiness program with the objective of having all of our significant operations functioning properly with respect to yk before january  we believe that our preparation for yk was successful  and have subsequently identified no material problems as a result 
since january  we have been operating our system using yk dates and have not experienced any difficulties or problems 
any policy written with an annual collection of premium has been successfully processed since january  with no interruption of services 
no material issues have been experienced since january  we have not experienced any material impact from external suppliers as a result of the yk issue 
we have spent approximately to date related to modifying existing systems to become yk compliant  and estimate that this amount represented approximately of our total information technology budget in we expect the impact of yk to have no material impact upon our financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands our consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been created and met from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income and maturities of investments 
we have provided  and may continue to provide  cash through public offerings of our common stock  capital markets activities or debt instruments 
the primary uses of cash are policy acquisition costs principally commissions  payments to policyholders  investment purchases and general and administrative expenses 
statutory requirements allow insurers to pay dividends only from statutory earnings as approved by the state insurance commissioner 
statutory earnings are generally lower than publicly reported earnings due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
we have not and do not intend to pay shareholder dividends in the near future due to these requirements  choosing to retain statutory surplus to support continued premium growth 
see dividend policy and business government regulation 
in  american network paid us a dividend of and paid us in  which were used for general corporate purposes 
in  our cash flows were attributable to cash provided by operations  cash used in investing and cash used in financing 
our cash decreased  in primarily due to the purchase of  in bonds and equity securities   used for the purchase of our common stock  which is held as treasury stock  as well as cash of  used to purchase united insurance group 
cash was provided primarily from the maturity and sale of  in bonds and equity securities 
these sources of funds were supplemented with  from operations 
the major provider of cash from operations was premium revenue used to fund reserve additions of  our cash increased  in primarily due to the sale of  in bonds and equity securities and the maturity of  of bonds 
these sources of funds coupled with  from operations more than offset  used to acquire bonds and equity securities 
the major provider of cash from operations was premium revenue used to fund reserve increases of  our cash decreased by  in primarily due to the purchase of  in bonds  which more than offset cash provided by operations and  in proceeds from the sale of bonds 
the major provider of cash from operations was additions to reserves of  in we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
at december   the average maturity of our bond portfolio was years  and our market value represented of our cost  with a current unrealized loss of  our equity portfolio exceeded cost by  at december  our equity portfolio exceeded cost by  in and  in on december   the average maturity of our bond portfolio was years  and its market value exceeded its cost by approximately  during  we evaluated and changed our investment policy to allow for the acquisition of debt and equity securities rated b or better by bond rating agencies 
included in our investment strategy was the decision to purchase convertible or preferred securities 
we hired an investment management firm that specializes in convertible securities to manage this portfolio 
the management firm is also a principle shareholder of our common stock 
as of december   shareholders equity was decreased by  due to unrealized losses of  in the investment portfolio 
as of december   shareholders equity was increased by  due to unrealized gains of  in the investment portfolio 
as of december   shareholders equity was increased by  due to unrealized gains of  in the investment portfolio 
our debt currently consists primarily of a mortgage note in the approximate amount of  and  in convertible subordinated debt 
the convertible debt  issued in november  is convertible into common stock at per share until november the debt carries a fixed interest coupon of  payable semi annually 
the mortgage note is currently amortized over years  and has a balloon payment due on the remaining outstanding balance in december although the note carries a variable interest rate  we have entered into an amortizing swap agreement with the same bank  with a notional amount equal to the outstanding debt  which has the effect of converting the note to a fixed rate of interest of 
in march  we contributed approximately  of the proceeds from the proceeds of the convertible subordinated debt to american independent network to initially capitalize this subsidiary 
in december  we contributed  to initially capitalize penn treaty bermuda 
penn treaty bermuda concurrently lent us in exchange for a note receivable 
the note is expected to pay interest at a rate of six percent  with principal repaid upon demand 
on december   penn treaty life dividended us its common stock ownership of penn treaty network 
at that time  penn treaty network assumed substantially all of the assets  liabilities and premium in force of penn treaty life through a purchase and assumption reinsurance agreement 
on december   we sold our common stock interest in penn treaty life to an unaffiliated insurer 
all remaining policies in force were assumed by penn treaty network through a quota share agreement 
on november   we entered a purchase agreement to acquire all of the common stock of united insurance group  a michigan based consortium of long term care insurance agencies 
the acquisition was effective january   for the amount of  as part of the purchase  we issued a note payable for  which was in the form of a three year zero coupon installment note 
the installment note  after discounting for imputed interest  was recorded as a note payable of  with a current outstanding balance of  at december  the remainder of the purchase was for cash 
united insurance group paid us a dividend of in our company consists of the insurers and a non insurer parent company  penn treaty american corporation the parent 
the parent directly controls of the voting stock of the insurers 
in the event the parent is unable to meet its financial obligations  becomes insolvent  or discontinues operations  the insurers financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
the parent currently has the obligation of making semi annual interest payments attributable to its convertible debt 
in that the dividend ability of the subsidiaries is restricted  the parent must rely on its own liquidity and cash flows to make all required interest installments 
management believes that the parent holds sufficient liquid funds from its current investments  dividend capabilities of united insurance group and from its line of credit to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries capital and surplus presently meet or exceed the requirements in all jurisdictions in which they are licensed 
our continued growth is dependent upon our ability to continue marketing efforts to expand our historical markets  continue to expand our network of agents and effectively market our products in states where our insurance subsidiaries are currently licensed and fund such marketing and expansion while at the same time maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
management believes that the funds necessary to accomplish the foregoing  including funds required to maintain adequate levels of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries  can be met through by funds generated from non insurance subsidiary dividends  current and future financial reinsurance transactions  off shore reinsurance through penn treaty bermuda and the availability of our line of credit facility 
we expect future capital market activities will be necessary to support our ongoing growth  but continue to seek alternative measures 
if alternative measures to support our growth are unsuccessful  we believe that additional capital would be required as early as in the event we fail to maintain minimum loss ratios calculated in accordance with statutory guidelines  we fail to meet other requirements mandated and enforced by regulatory authorities  we have adverse claims experience in the future  we are unable to obtain additional financing to support future growth or the economy continues to affect the buying powers of senior citizens  our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected 
certain information presented in this filing constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe that our expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results of our operations will not differ materially from our expectations 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include  among others  the adequacy of our loss reserves and our ability to meet statutory surplus requirements especially in light of our recent growth  our ability to comply with government regulations  the ability of senior citizens to purchase our products given the increasing costs of health care  the modality of premium revenue and our ability to expand our network of productive independent agents
