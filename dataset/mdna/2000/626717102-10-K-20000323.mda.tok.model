million  with no per share effect  in the special items included after tax gains of million  
a diluted share  from sale of assets  and million

vs 
excluding special items  income in totaled million  a share  an increase of million from the million earned in the increase in income was primarily attributable to record earnings from exploration and production operations  which totaled million in compared to million in this improvement was partially offset by lower earnings from the company s refining  marketing and transportation operations  which earned million in  down from million earned in the improvement in exploration and production earnings in was primarily attributable to an increase of a barrel in the average worldwide crude oil sales price  up compared to  and record crude oil production 
in addition  the company s worldwide natural gas sales volume and us natural gas sales prices both increased in refining  marketing and transportation operations were adversely affected by the increase in the prices of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks 
this segment s decline in earnings was primarily attributable to lower us operating results  as rising crude oil prices squeezed margins throughout most of the year 
the costs of corporate and other activities  which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in compared to million in the increase in corporate costs in was primarily attributable to higher net interest costs and higher costs of awards under the company s incentive plans 
vs 
excluding special items  income totaled million in  
a diluted share  a decrease of million from the million earned in the income reduction was primarily attributable to a million decline in earnings from the company s exploration and production operations 
sharply lower crude oil prices in were the main reason for the reduction 
the company s average crude oil sales price declined by a barrel in  down from oil prices realized in higher crude oil production from new fields in canada and the united kingdom were mostly offset by lower production from maturing us and us oil fields and by selective shut in of canadian heavy oil production 
natural gas sales prices in the united states declined in and us natural gas sales volume was down 
earnings from the company s refining  marketing and transportation operations were down million in  as record levels of finished product sales volumes were more than offset by lower unit margins on product sales in the united states 
the costs of corporate and other activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher net interest costs offset in part by lower costs under the company s incentive plans 
in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment

natural gas sales volumes increased in in both the united states and canada  and each area benefited from higher average natural gas sales prices 
lower average natural gas sales prices in the united kingdom served as a partial offset 
the earnings decline in was primarily due to lower worldwide crude oil sales prices  which averaged a barrel in and in lower us natural gas sales prices and volumes also contributed to the decline 
partial offsets were provided by higher crude oil production and lower exploration costs 
crude oil production from new fields in the united kingdom brought on stream during the third quarter of and from the hibernia field  offshore newfoundland  which came on stream in late  was partially offset by selective shut in of heavy oil production in western canada in response to lower heavy oil prices and by lower production from mature oil fields in the united states and the united kingdom

a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states crude oil natural gas canada crude oil natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom crude oil natural gas ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil and gas liquids production averaged  barrels a day in   in and  in crude oil and liquids production in the united states increased in  with the increase primarily due to new production from several small fields on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
in  us production was down from  primarily due to declining production at mature oil fields in the gulf of mexico 
crude oil production in canada rose in and established a record of  barrels a day 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of  barrels a day at hibernia  which averaged  in hibernia  which came on stream in the fourth quarter of  produced  barrels a day in and in production at the company s synthetic oil operation in canada increased in  but this increase was offset by and reductions in onshore canadian heavy oil and light oil production  respectively  during the year 
the higher net production of synthetic oil in was due to a increase in gross production  partially offset by a slightly higher net profit royalty rate caused by higher oil prices 
the company s net interest in production of synthetic oil in canada increased in due to a increase in gross production and a decrease in the net profits royalty rate as a result of lower oil prices 
before royalties  the company s synthetic oil production was  barrels a day in   in and  in heavy oil production declined by barrels a day in due to continued selective shut in of fields caused by low oil prices during the early part of the year 
in  crude oil production in canada increased 
as a result of selective shut ins in the second half of the year  production of heavy oil in canada decreased in  compared to the company s uk oil production increased in after an increase in oil production from the mungo monan and schiehallion fields  which commenced in the third quarter of  averaged  and  barrels a day  respectively  in mungo monan produced  barrels a day in and schiehallion produced  oil production from the t block field in the united kingdom declined by during  after an decline in production from ninian  the company s other major north sea oil field  declined in  after having declined in production in ecuador declined in due to pipeline restrictions  after being essentially unchanged in when compared to worldwide sales of natural gas averaged million cubic feet a day in  million in and million in us natural gas sales were million cubic feet a day in  million in and million in the increase in us natural gas sales in was mainly due to sales from several new fields in the gulf of mexico that offset lower sales from maturing fields in the gulf 
the decrease in us natural gas sales in was mainly due to reduced deliverability in certain maturing gulf of mexico fields 
natural gas sales in canada in of million cubic feet were at record levels for the fourth straight year  as sales increased in following a increase in natural gas sales in the united kingdom of million cubic feet were essentially unchanged in  following a decline in as previously indicated  worldwide crude oil sales prices strengthened considerably throughout after a significant downturn during in the united states  murphy s monthly sales prices for crude oil and condensate ranged from to a barrel  and averaged for the year  above the average price 
in canada  the average sales price for light oil was a barrel in  also an increase of 
heavy oil prices in canada averaged a barrel  up from prices in the average sales price for synthetic oil in was a barrel  higher than a year earlier 
the sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field averaged a barrel  up

in canada  crude oil prices in declined for light oil  for heavy oil  for synthetic oil and for hibernia 
sales prices in the united kingdom were down in and prices in ecuador were down 
although crude oil sales prices were strong in early  the company can give no assurance that prices will remain at or near these levels in the future 
average monthly natural gas sales prices in the united states ranged from to an mcf during for the year  us sales prices averaged an mcf compared to a year ago 
the average price for natural gas sold in canada during was an mcf  an increase of from the average in  as canadian natural gas sales prices moved closer to parity with other north american gas prices during the year 
the average price in the united kingdom declined to 
the decline in average uk sales prices primarily resulted from a contractual price basis adjustment at the company s largest gas producing field in the united kingdom 
average us natural gas sales prices in were lower than in  prices were essentially unchanged in canada  and prices in the united kingdom declined by 
based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each a barrel and 
an mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining  marketing and transportation segments could be affected differently 
production costs were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel of production during the last three years were as follows 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the decrease in us production cost per equivalent barrel in was attributable to lower well servicing costs combined with higher production volumes 
the increase in canada in  excluding synthetic oil  was caused by higher well servicing costs at heavy oil properties 
the increase in the canadian synthetic oil unit rate was due to an increase in royalty barrels caused by higher sales prices 
the decrease in the uk cost per barrel was due to higher production from lower cost fields at mungo monan and schiehallion 
the higher cost in ecuador in was caused by higher field operating costs combined with lower production during the year 
the increase in the us cost per equivalent barrel in was attributable to lower production volumes combined with higher workover costs 
the decline in canada in  excluding synthetic oil  was caused by higher oil production at hibernia  voluntary shut in of certain high cost heavy oil production and a lower canadian dollar exchange rate vs 
the us dollar 
the decrease in the cost for synthetic oil in was due to lower maintenance costs  a decrease in royalty barrels due to lower sales prices and a lower canadian dollar exchange rate 
the lower cost in ecuador in was caused by lower energy and other field operating costs during the year 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditure totals for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploratory expenditures charged against income dry hole costs geological and geophysical costs other costs undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization for exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the increase was primarily due to higher production from the hibernia field offshore eastern canada 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower worldwide hydrocarbon production 
refining  marketing and transportation earnings from refining  marketing and transportation operations before special items were million in  million in and million in operations in the united states lost million in compared to earnings of million in  as the average cost of crude oil and other feedstocks increased more than product sales realizations 
us operations earned million in settlement of crude oil swap agreements increased earnings by million in uk operations earned million in  million in and million in the lower earnings in the united kingdom in were caused by a larger increase in the cost of refining feedstock than in product sales realizations 
canadian operations contributed million to earnings compared to million in and million in unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil  other feedstocks  refining and transportation to point of sale averaged 
a barrel in the united states in  in and in us product sales declined in following a increase in the decline in sales volume in the united states in was caused by a turnaround at the company s meraux refinery early in the year 
us margins were under pressure during most of and the second half of unit margins were very weak in early and the company was experiencing losses in its us downstream operations 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged a barrel in  in and in sales of petroleum products were lower in following a increase in the volume decline in was attributable to lower sales in the cargo market 
sales in both terminal and cargo markets increased in although margins improved in  the company s branded outlets still face stiff competition from supermarket sales of motor fuels 
unit margins have weakened considerably in early based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
a barrel 
a gallon fluctuation in unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
income before special items from purchasing  transporting and reselling crude oil in canada in increased by million due to improved earnings from the company s crude oil trading and pipeline operations 
earnings declined by million in as lower prices for heavy oil led to production shut ins  which brought about lower pipeline throughputs and fewer barrels available for crude trading activities 
special items net income for the last three years included the special items reviewed in the following paragraphs  the quarter in which each item occurred is indicated 
the effects of special items on quarterly results for and are presented on page f of this form k report

charge resulting from cancellation of a drilling rig contract an after tax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from cancellation of a drilling contract for the terra nova oil field  offshore eastern canada 
the contract was cancelled because market conditions allowed a more efficient and modern rig to be obtained  thus reducing drilling costs for the terra nova project compared to what they might otherwise have been 

write down of crude oil inventories to market value an after tax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of to establish a valuation allowance to reduce the carried amount of crude oil inventories in the united kingdom and canada to market values

the increase in long term debt in was attributable to the sale of million of long term notes due in  the proceeds of these notes were used primarily to pay down borrowings under other long term credit facilities 
long term debt totaled million at the end of compared to million at december  stockholders equity was billion at the end of compared to billion a year ago and billion at the end of a summary of transactions in the stockholders equity accounts is presented on page f of this form k report 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
current financing arrangements are set forth in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect any problem in meeting future requirements for funds 
murphy had commitments of million for capital projects in progress at december   including million related to its share of a multiyear contract for a semisubmersible deepwater drilling rig and associated equipment 
certain costs committed under this contract will be charged to murphy s partners when future deepwater wells are drilled 
environmental the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect the environment and or impose remedial obligations 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including refineries  oil and gas fields  service stations  and terminals  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s reserve for remedial obligations  which is included in deferred credits and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  contains certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the amount reserved by up to an estimated million 
the company has received notices from the epa that it is currently considered a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites and has also been assigned responsibility by defendants at another superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the four sites 
the company does not expect that its related remedial costs will be material to its financial condition or its results of operations  and it has not provided a reserve for remedial costs on superfund sites 
additional information may become known in the future that would alter this assessment  including any requirement to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or indications of additional responsibility by the company 
following a compliance inspection of the superior  wisconsin refinery  the epa gave the company notices of violation of environmental laws 
although the penalty amounts were not listed  the statutes involved provide for rates of up to  per day of violation 
the epa has referred the matter to the us department of justice for enforcement 
the superior refinery also received a notice of violation from the wisconsin department of natural resources for alleged failure to meet new source performance emission standards for the sulfur plant at the refinery 
this item has been referred to the wisconsin department of justice for enforcement 
the company believes it has valid defenses to these allegations and plans vigorous defenses 
while the enforcement actions are in their preliminary stages and no assurance can be given  the company does not believe that these or other known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
there is the possibility that expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
such expenditures could materially affect the results of operations in a future period 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous wastes and other chemical substances 
these costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in year issues the year issues related to the possibility that computer programs and embedded computer chips might be unable to accurately process data with year dates of and beyond 
murphy devoted significant internal and external resources to address year compliance 
the company s year project project was successful  as the company experienced no operational disruptions attributable to year the total amount expended on the project was million  including million in of the total expended  million was included in expense  including 
million in  and costs of million have been capitalized as improvements in business system functionality beyond year compliance 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
if crude oil prices  which strengthened during  remain strong  the company believes that future prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected 
lower commodity prices in led to a softening of prices for goods and services during the prior year 
accounting matters the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
effective january   murphy must recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
a derivative instrument meeting certain conditions may be designated as a hedge of a specific exposure  accounting for changes in a derivative s fair value will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
any transition adjustments resulting from adopting this statement will be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  the company makes limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific market risks 
the company has not yet determined the effects that sfas no 
will have on its future consolidated financial statements or the amount of the cumulative adjustment that will be made upon adopting this new standard 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
entering  oil prices were under extreme pressure  but due to increased worldwide demand and disciplined management of supply by the world s producers primarily by members of opec oil prices rebounded significantly and the price of west texas intermediate crude oil was more than a barrel at the end of despite the fact that crude oil prices have continued to strengthen in early due to low crude oil inventories caused by supplies not fully meeting demands  the company can make no assurance that the price of oil will remain at this high level in the future 
due to milder than normal winter weather across much of north america  the price of natural gas has remained under pressure in early the company was experiencing losses in its us refining and marketing operations in early  and uk margins had weakend considerably 
in such an environment  constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for expenditures of million 
of this amount  million or is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  another is allocated to canada  including million for continued development of the terra nova oil field  offshore newfoundland  that is currently scheduled for an early start up  is allocated to the united kingdom  is allocated to ecuador  and is allocated to other foreign operations  which primarily pertain to malaysia 
planned refining  marketing and transportation capital expenditures for are million  including million in the united states  million in the united kingdom and million in canada 
us amounts include funds for additional stations at wal mart sites 
capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect changes in estimated cash flow 
in the united states  the company is concentrating its exploration and production capital spending on prospects in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico 
although the company is pleased with the successes achieved to date in this exploration program  most of its discoveries in the deep water will take two years or more to bring on production 
because of the lead time to bring on this new production  the company expects that its worldwide oil and natural gas production will decline in by approximately to on a barrel equivalent basis when compared to production levels 
forward looking statements this form k report  including documents incorporated by reference herein  contains statements of the company s expectations  intentions  plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the company s control 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors  including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the company s january  form k report on file with the us securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage certain risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
at december   the company was a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
these swaps mature in and the swaps require the company to pay an average interest rate of over their composite lives  and at december   the interest rate to be received by the company averaged 
the variable interest rate received by the company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly 
the company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was a gain of 
million at december  at december   of the company s long term debt had variable interest rates and was denominated in canadian dollars 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would not change the company s interest expense in after a 
million favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps 
a increase in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar vs 
the us dollar would increase interest expense in by 
million on debt denominated in canadian dollars 
at december   the company was a party to crude oil swap agreements for a total notional volume of million barrels that reduce a portion of the financial exposure of murphy s us refineries to crude oil price movements 
the agreements mature in and at termination  the swaps require murphy to pay an average crude oil price of a barrel and to receive the average of the near month nymex west texas intermediate wti crude oil prices during the respective contractual maturity periods 
at december   the estimated fair value of these crude oil swaps was a gain of million  a fluctuation in the price of wti crude oil would have changed the estimated fair value of these swaps by million 
at december   murphy was also a party to natural gas price swap agreements for a total notional volume of million mmbtu that are intended to reduce a portion of the financial exposure of its meraux  louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchased for fuel 
the agreements are to be settled equally over the months of in each month of settlement  the swaps require murphy to pay an average natural gas price of an mmbtu and to receive the average nymex henry hub price for the final three trading days of the month 
at december   the estimated fair value of these agreements was a loss of 
million  a fluctuation in the average nymex henry hub price of natural gas would have changed the estimated fair value of these swaps by million
