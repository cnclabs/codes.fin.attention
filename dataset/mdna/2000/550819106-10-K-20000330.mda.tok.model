item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reflects the discontinuation of the wovens segment 
thus  the results of operations of the wovens segment have been excluded for all periods discussed 
sales overview in  sales from continuing operations increased percent to million 
acquisitions contributed sales of million 
internal marketing actions resulted in a net increase in sales of million 
external forces accounted for a net decrease of million 
in  the acquisition of a manufacturer of medical and pharmaceutical products and an automotive heat shield operation contributed sales of million 
internal marketing actions plus external market forces produced a combined negative impact of million 
during  internal and external forces combined reduced sales by a net million 
acquisitions lydall isolates the impact of acquisitions for three years  after which time it considers such operations to be fully integrated 
the company made no acquisitions in however  three acquisitions made in were the primary drivers of sales growth in the acquisition of gerhardi  included in the thermal acoustical segment  had no impact on sales or results of operations in in  gerhardi contributed sales totaling million 
acquiring gerhardi increased international sales and fulfilled the company s goal of having a thermal manufacturing presence in europe 
gerhardi s heat shield business directly complements lydall s domestic automotive business and opens growth opportunities both in the u 
s 
and europe 
the injection molding and chrome plating operations of gerhardi  however  are not central to lydall s long term strategic focus 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company announced its intention to divest the two non core operations 
these two operations generated sales of approximately million in the company expects to sell these businesses in two other acquisitions a medical device business  part of the filtration separation segment  and a domestic automotive heat shield operation  included in the thermal acoustical segment added incremental sales of million in and million in internal marketing actions during  sales increased by a net million due to internal marketing actions 
lydall defines product introductions  net of product discontinuances  market share changes  and selling price changes as internal marketing actions 
internal marketing actions caused a net increase in sales of thousand in and a net decrease of million in sales from product introductions of million represented a percent increase over new product sales of million 
this compares with incremental new product sales of million in growth was primarily attributable to automotive applications  specifically  the development of zero clearance tm high performance  self adhesive underbody shields  innovative polyshield tm components  the acoustical barrier  dblyte tm  and a large thermal acoustical shield introduced on the latest lincoln ls and jaguar s type models 
new product introductions also occurred in the filtration separation segment  including both air filtration and biomedical fluid processing products 
product discontinuances amounted to million in compared with million in and million in as with product introductions  most product discontinuances related to automotive products under the thermal acoustical segment 
the and reductions were primarily attributable to the replacement of existing products by new products 
in  lydall exited certain low margin non core products  while discontinuing a flame barrier material sold to the office panel market 
market share changes in caused a net sales increase of million 
a healthy market expansion overseas by the materials handling business of the paperboard segment was offset by losses of boxboard market share within that same segment 
the filtration separation segment achieved market share increases  particularly in europe and asia  and the company s distribution services operation captured market share 
in  changes in market share caused sales to decrease by million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower asian demand for filtration media employed in high efficiency air filtration applications and from losses to lower cost competitors in the mature electrical insulation market 
in  net market share losses of million occurred primarily in the thermal acoustical segment related to the automotive market 
prices declined by a net million during and thousand over the course of in both years  pricing weakness was felt in the thermal acoustical and filtration separation segments  specifically related to non automotive thermal barriers and air filter media 
pricing adjustments associated with long term contractual commitments also affected certain automotive products 
in  the paperboard segment recorded price increases of approximately million 
in  pricing caused a drop in sales of million 
price changes in were concentrated in the paperboard segment 
selling prices of lydall s materials handling products in this segment are somewhat dependent on the pricing of linerboard  its primary raw material 
external market forces lydall defines external forces as the effects of economic and market changes beyond the influence of management  including the effects of market decay  pricing pressures  and foreign exchange 
during  external forces reduced sales by a net million 
economic growth and market share gains made in the filtration separation segment were offset by market changes  such as the design out of certain products in the thermal acoustical segment 
competitive pricing environments  particularly in the paperboard segment  also countered economic and market share growth during the year 
in  external market forces caused a deterioration in sales of million 
a weak air filtration market  declining use of pyrotechnic airbag inflator systems that employ lydall s materials  and a number of automotive thermal barrier design changes were the major contributors to this decline 
in  external forces reduced sales by million 
positive economic forces and market growth substantially offset the effects of market decay and other negative market changes during the year 
currency exchange rates  which have a nominal effect in most years  resulted in a million reduction in sales in changes in sales millions prior year s net sales acquisitions internal marketing actions 
external market forces total change current year s net sales gross margin overview gross margin increased to million during  but declined as a percent of sales to percent 
acquisitions added gross margin of million 
the increased volume had a positive impact of million 
net pricing actions eroded gross margin by million 
cost reductions improved gross margin by million 
in  margins were lowered by cost overruns associated with process redesigns and new process implementations necessitated by the introduction of a record number of new automotive products 
the company improved manufacturing efficiencies during the year and put procedures in place to facilitate smoother  more cost efficient new product launches in the future 
gross margin in was million  or percent of sales 
acquisitions produced incremental margin improvements in  but lower sales volume  and the combined effect of price decreases in relation to net cost increases acted to reduce margins 
the shutdown and consolidation of automotive thermal operations in north carolina and additional overhead to support the operations of charter medical  ltd 
as a stand alone facility lowered margins 
cost reduction programs during the year contributed positively to overall gross margin performance 
in  gross margin was million  or percent of sales 
gross margin was negatively impacted by lower sales volume and the net effects of price decreases that were only partially offset by cost decreases from vendors 
acquisitions gerhardi increased lydall s total sales by approximately percent  but diluted total gross margin as a percent of total sales 
during the year  gerhardi improved its margins while making management changes  relocating and consolidating metal heat shield production  and successfully completing an extensive expansion of the meinerzhagen plant 
chartermed  inc  now charter medical in new jersey  and engineered thermal systems  incorporated  now the st 
johnsbury operation of lydall westex  were successfully integrated into the company over the course of margins at the new jersey operation showed marked improvement despite the distraction of construction during the year of a manufacturing clean room devoted to pharmaceutical processing products 
the st 
johnsbury operation improved its margin performance  added new business  and began construction of a larger manufacturing plant to accommodate sales growth and to support its focus on large  complex shields 
lydall looks forward to both these acquisitions continuing to grow and contributing positively to company wide margin improvements in in  charter medical in new jersey and the st 
johnsbury operation combined to produce million of incremental gross margin 
since gerhardi was acquired on december   it had no effect on lydall s consolidated operating results 
gross margin was not affected by acquisitions in effects of changes in sales volume in  gross margin was depressed by increased sales volume resulting from the acquisition of gerhardi  whose margins were significantly below the company s average 
also  gains in gross margin from increased sales of lydall s core businesses and benefits of cost reduction efforts during the year were diminished by pricing pressures 
lower sales volume produced a million decline in gross margin in  accounting for approximately percent of the total margin decline for the year 
positive contributions from new products and market growth in several product lines were recorded in however  the combined negative effects from design outs of automotive heat management products  market decay  market share losses  effects of the asian economy  and a poor market for filtration products worldwide overwhelmed these positives 
the same dynamics that affected gross margin in reduced gross margin in by million 
the loss of operating leverage due to design outs and product discontinuation offset the benefits of economic and market growth 
price changes in relation to cost increases net pricing actions eroded gross margin by million in in both and  the thermal acoustical and filtration separation segments faced pricing pressures as described under sales in this item the pricing environments for the paperboard segment  although somewhat more stable than in the two previous years  remained extremely competitive in a primary focus of the company s cost reduction campaign in was in the area of raw material costs 
savings achieved through these initiatives partly alleviated pricing pressures experienced during the year 
in  prices declined overall by thousand 
vendor costs rose by an estimated million which created a combined negative impact on gross margin of million 
the largest impact occurred in the thermal acoustical segment for products sold to non automotive thermal applications 
the materials handling and automotive thermal barrier businesses also experienced some margin erosion due to pricing pressures 
during  pricing actions reduced gross margin by million 
the largest part of this reduction emanated from the paperboard segment related to materials handling products 
price concessions were evident in lydall s thermal acoustical and filtration separation segments as well 
cost reductions over the last three years  lydall has focused a great deal of effort on a company wide cost reduction program 
a large portion of the savings realized in was reinvested in the development of the core businesses of thermal acoustical and filtration separation and in other initiatives such as lydall s economic value added eva program 
the net impact of these actions on gross margin was a positive million 
the company has consistently driven down manufacturing costs over the years through a combination of management actions and capital improvements 
the positive impact on gross margin of these actions in was million compared with savings of million in other effects other effects normally include fluctuations in inventory  depreciation expense  and other adjustments 
these factors reduced gross margin by million in in  the above factors reduced margins by approximately million 
lydall also closed a facility in north carolina and wrote off an outdated production line and related support equipment in france 
in addition  the company set up a new legal entity and relocated the medical business from within an automotive thermal acoustical operation to a separate facility 
the total impact of other effects on gross margin was million 
in  other effects had a positive impact on gross margin of million 
changes in gross margin millions prior year s gross margin acquisitions effects of changes in sales volume price increases in relation to cost changes cost reductions other effects total change current year s gross margin as a percent of net sales pretax income from continuing operations overview the company earned million of pretax income from continuing operations in the net impact of acquisitions was slightly positive in  however  pricing pressures  especially in paperboard markets  lowered pretax income 
pretax income from continuing operations declined to million in from million in acquisitions in  gerhardi incurred an operating loss of thousand 
as disclosed under sales in this item  lydall intends to sell the unprofitable injection molding and chrome plating operations of gerhardi in charter medical in new jersey and the st 
johnsbury operation contributed an incremental million of operating profit 
there was no acquisition effect on pretax income in and operations pretax income from continuing operations in  other than acquisitions  equaled million compared with million in as discussed in the gross margin section of item  there were many factors that impacted operating results in gains from increased sales volume and operating efficiencies were countered by delays associated with new product launches at domestic automotive operations  pricing pressures in the filtration markets  and competitive conditions in the paperboard segment 
selling  product development  and administrative expenses were reduced during the year by million 
this compares with an increase in of million  including the pretax cost of the severance agreement for the company s former chairman and chief executive officer and selected impairment charges 
investments and financing nonoperating investments and financing costs combined to reduce pretax income by thousand in investment and foreign exchange transaction income rose by a net million 
the majority of this increase resulted from a foreign exchange transaction gain due to the appreciation of the dollar in relation to the euro 
the gain related to a portion of the gerhardi purchase price funded from domestic credit lines denominated in euro 
also  during  interest expense increased by million as a result of higher debt levels associated with the three acquisitions made in nonoperating investments and financing costs combined to decrease pretax income by million in investment balances were much lower as lydall funded a major capital program  repurchased common stock  and made three acquisitions 
in  investments and financing costs produced thousand of additional pretax income 
cash flow during was in excess of operating and financing requirements resulting in higher investment income 
changes in pretax income from continuing operations millions prior year s pretax income from continuing operations acquisitions change in gross margin selling  product development  and administrative expenses total change from acquisitions 
operations change in gross margin

total change current year s pretax income from continuing operations forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in general  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that such forward looking statements are based on the current expectations of management and are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
in addition to general economic conditions and market trends  some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include  but are not limited to  the following a major downturn of the us and european automotive market 
although lydall s automotive sales are not solely contingent on the strength of the automotive market  a significant downturn of the us and european automotive industry could have a substantial impact on lydall s results 
the company can also be affected when automotive manufacturers discontinue production of specific models that contain lydall s products 
on the other hand  lydall benefits from the introduction of new models 
approximately percent of lydall s total sales in were to the automotive market 
lydall s primary automotive products are thermal barriers and heat shields employed both inside and outside of vehicles 
the company also produces acoustical barrier products 
most of lydall s products are supplied to meet unique  niche applications 
there is no direct correlation between the number of lydall parts on a vehicle and the number of units built  as with tires or steering wheels for example 
slight fluctuations in automotive production have relatively little effect on lydall s business  however  a major downward shift could prevent lydall from achieving its projected results 
raw material pricing and supply 
raw material pricing and supply issues affect all of lydall s businesses and can influence results in the short term 
pricing fluctuations  however  particularly impact the company s materials handling business 
these products are made from laminated virgin kraft paperboard  also known as linerboard 
the materials handling business is unique for lydall because the selling price of lydall s products move in relation to pricing of linerboard  its primary raw material 
thus  significant changes in the pricing of linerboard directly affect this portion of lydall s business 
the thermal acoustical segment uses aluminum in the manufacturing of most automotive heat shields 
the heat shields are sold under long term agreements with established fixed sales prices 
the volatility in aluminum prices over the agreement periods could impact thermal acoustical segment profitability 
new product introductions 
improved performance and growth is partially linked to new product introductions planned for the future 
the timing and degree of success of new product programs could impact lydall s projected results 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
liquidity and capital resources lydall completed with million outstanding under its various credit facilities 
the indebtedness is related to the three strategic acquisitions completed in the year end balance represents a decrease of million  or percent 
operating cash flow in increased by percent from to million 
debt was reduced  and capital investments of million were made in the company funded a similar level of capital expenditures in and purchases of common stock in totaled thousand compared with purchases in and totaling million and million  respectively 
cash flow overview cash from operating activities in was million compared with million in in  cash from operating activities equaled million 
the positive cash flows in were derived from operating earnings before deducting non cash charges from depreciation  amortization  and loss on disposal of the wovens segment 
cash used for investing activities in was million  mostly related to capital expenditures 
investment activity in was down from million in  as no acquisitions were completed in investing activities in totaled million  primarily capital expenditure related 
financing activities used million in payments and proceeds related to short and long term borrowings were million and million  respectively in in lydall generated million in cash from financing activities 
net proceeds from bank credit lines were million  while the largest use of cash was the purchase of common stock for million 
in  financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million  including debt repayments totaling million and common stock purchases of million 
working capital productivity lydall measures working capital productivity  or working capital turnover  to assess short term utilization of operating resources 
working capital turnover is defined as net sales divided by the quarterly average of receivables and inventory  less accounts payable 
turnover declined by percent in to times from times in  and times in overall performance was negatively impacted by the gerhardi acquisition and charter medical in new jersey  both acquired in excluding the aforementioned operations  significant progress with inventory management was achieved throughout the company  offset by increased levels of accounts receivable and lower accounts payable 
management s goal is to improve turnover to historical rates in millions net sales average working capital working capital productivity percent change from previous year future cash requirements cash requirements for include the funding of ongoing operations  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
in  lydall suspended purchases of common stock except to offset shares granted under the company s stock option award program  choosing to focus on cash requirements for existing operations and acquisitions 
the capital budget is million  down from actual expenditures in and of million and million  respectively 
management expects to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs from cash provided by operating activities in acquisitions  if completed  would be financed under the credit facility described under credit arrangements below 
credit arrangements lydall  inc and certain subsidiaries entered into a million credit facility on july  with a group of five banking institutions 
the entire facility is comprised of a million domestic revolving credit facility  renewed every three years  and a euro denominated five year term loan  which is an obligation of lydall s german subsidiary 
the current credit facility replaces annually renewed domestic unsecured credit lines totaling million 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is based on various money market rates selected by the company at the time of borrowing 
the credit facility carries an annual facility fee  as well as a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility 
the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions as part of the credit agreement 
the agreement also prohibits the company from incurring certain indebtedness  restricts asset sales and capital expenditures  and limits certain investments and dividends to the extent such activity affects the financial ratios 
certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the company maintain additional lines of credit totaling million as of december  these credit facilities incur interest at rates ranging from percent to libor plus percent 
management believes that current credit arrangements provide ample capacity to meet working capital requirements and to fund future capital expenditures 
capital structure lydall s long term financial strategy calls for the prudent use of debt financing 
substantial debt financing in combination with cash from operating activities are available to complete strategic acquisitions in lydall s core thermal acoustical and filtration separation markets 
at the end of  total indebtedness was million  representing percent of lydall s total capital structure 
the company continually explores its core markets for suitable acquisitions 
based on a percent debt to total capitalization ratio and maintaining investment grade credit quality  the company could borrow up to million to fund acquisitions 
management has indicated a willingness to exceed the percent debt to total capitalization ratio to complete a compelling strategic acquisition 
year lydall began a comprehensive information technology upgrade program lydall in lydall addressed information technology and non information technology systems  and also included an assessment of the status of third parties 
the project went beyond accommodating century dating issues and included the implementation of systems to improve product quality  process efficiencies  and productivity 
as of december   the company had satisfactorily completed the lydall initiative  which included testing major systems in a simulated environment on and around sensitive year dates 
date sensitive components of machinery and equipment had been reviewed and remediation of any non compliant parts was completed 
the company also examined information from all major customers and suppliers and did not identify any significant year concerns 
as of the date of this report  the company has not experienced any material interruptions resulting from year date processing 
while the possibility of issues arising from year date processing still exists  the impact is likely to be immaterial 
the company will continue to monitor for year problems during the first half of to ensure that any potential problems are minimized 
other key financial items cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at the end of from million in receivables 
receivables were million in and million in  of which trade receivables were million and million for and  respectively 
days of sales outstanding in trade receivables were in and in foreign and export sales were approximately percent of total sales in  percent in  and percent in these sales are concentrated primarily in europe  the far east  mexico and canada 
inventories 
inventories were million at december   net of lifo reserves of million and million at december  net of lifo reserves of million 
working capital 
working capital increased to million on december  from a deficit of million on december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to from 
the majority of the working capital improvement resulted from reclassification of certain long term assets and liabilities to current assets and related liabilities held for sale 
in addition  a portion of debt classified as current at december  is classified as long term at december  based on the company s new credit arrangement entered into in july capital asset expenditures 
capital asset expenditures were million in  million in  and million in depreciation was million in  million in  and million in the company s capital plan calls for commitments of million 
expenditures in are expected to be financed from existing cash balances or cash generated from operations 
debt to total capitalization 
debt to total capitalization decreased to percent in from percent in common stockholders equity 
common stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  on a per share basis  common stockholders equity increased to at december  from at december  dividend policy 
the company does not pay a cash dividend on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
cash will be reinvested into core businesses 
research and development 
research and development investments were million in  and million in both and recently issued accounting standards see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk lydall is exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk lydall has sales and manufacturing activities in foreign countries 
as a result  financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s primary currency exposure is with the euro 
lydall s foreign and domestic operations limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions primarily in their local currencies 
lydall utilizes bank loans and other debt instruments throughout its operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  such debt is taken out primarily in underlying local currencies of its subsidiaries 
lydall uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate exposure to foreign currency volatility 
at december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
lydall had a forward contract outstanding at december  to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency volatility in the december  acquisition of a german subsidiary 
the contract  for a contractual amount equivalent to million at a contract rate of  limited lydall s exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations and settled in january at a minimal gain 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate exposure is most sensitive to fluctuations in united states and european interest rates  which primarily impacts interest paid on debt 
at december  the company had million outstanding on various lines of credit with variable interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate paid on this debt was percent in the company also had million outstanding on a year term loan with a variable interest rate 
in july of  lydall entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the base rate component of the interest rate on the term loan to a fixed rate of percent to take advantage of favorable long term borrowing rates in europe 
including the effect of the swap the weighted average interest rate on the long term debt was percent
