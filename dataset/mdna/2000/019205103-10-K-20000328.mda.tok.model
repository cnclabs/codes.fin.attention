the impact of interest not recognized on nonaccrual loans was immaterial in the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral 
as of december   there were no impaired loans for which specific valuation allowances had been recorded 
the company has a loan review program that it believes takes a conservative approach to evaluating nonperforming loans and the loan portfolio in general 
the loan review program continually audits the loan portfolio to confirm management s loan risk rating system and track problem loans  to insure compliance with loan policy underwriting guidelines  and to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management determines the allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors including reviewing and evaluating the bank s loan portfolio in order to identify potential problem loans  concentrations of credit  and risk factors connected to the portfolio  as well as current local and national economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount that is adequate to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses  in accordance with the company s loan policy  when they are determined by management to be uncollectible 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when they are received 
when management determines that the allowance for loan losses is less than adequate to provide for potential losses  a direct charge is made to operating income 
the allowance for loan losses account at december  was million  or of loans net of unearned discount outstanding compared to million  or of loans outstanding at december  the adequacy of the allowance to provide coverage for nonperforming loans was at year end compared to at year end the provision expense in of thousand provided coverage in excess of the thousand in net loans charged off

the board of directors believes that the repurchases of stock have been an excellent investment opportunity for the company and its shareholders  based on the company s strong capital position and growth potential 
total shareholders equity also reflects an adjustment for the sfas required change in market value of the company s available for sale investment securities

capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
at december   the company exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution 
a more comprehensive analysis of regulatory capital requirements  including ratios for the company and its subsidiary bank  is included in note in the consolidated financial statements section of the annual report

liquidity liquidity is the ability of the company to generate and maintain sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and to meet customer s loan demands or deposit withdrawals 
maintaining a stable core deposit base is one of the fundamentals in the company s liquidity management policy 
it is the company s goal to raise cash when needed  at the most reasonable cost  with a minimum of loss 
management carefully monitors its liquidity position and seeks to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its needs 
the company meets its liquidity needs by balancing levels of cash flow from the sale or maturity of available for sale investment securities and loan amortizing payments and maturities  as well as with the availability of dependable borrowing sources which can be accessed when needed 
lines of credit with the bank s primary correspondents and the federal home loan bank as of year end were million of which million remained available 
impact of the year prior to year end  the company had completed the assessment of its yk risk  had implemented all necessary system enhancements  and had tested all systems and equipment to ensure customer service and minimize its business risks in the year a business resumption contingency plan along with a liquidity contingency plan were in place to provide for problems should they occur 
as a result of strong customer communications and marketing efforts by both the company and the banking industry  consumer confidence in the banking industry s ability to resolve yk problems increased as january  approached 
the increase in consumer confidence resulted in the company experiencing no significant yk related deposit declines or cash withdrawals in december of the month of january reflected a successful transition to the year of all of the company s systems and equipment 
in particular  the company s on premise computer processing system continued to perform as the yk testing program had indicated that it would 
all year end processing was completed as scheduled and daily processing since year end has been performed without any yk related incidents 
by the end of the first week of business in january  the company s contingency cash was reinvested 
the company estimates that interest income was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of by thousand as a result of the uninvested cash being reserved for yk customer contingencies 
total costs incurred and income lost by the company in connection with remediation and contingency planning for yk are estimated at thousand  with thousand expensed in  and thousand of expense and lost income in early indications from the company s commercial loan department reflect that the quality of the company s loan portfolio has had no negative yk related impact 
the company believes that its business risks to yk related problems have been significantly reduced with the successful operation of its systems during the early part of the year by the end of the first quarter of  the company expects that a sufficient level of business activity with all of its third party vendors will indicate if any risk remains 
until such time  the company will continue to maintain its yk business resumption contingency plan to manage such risk 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk in its lending  deposit  and borrowing activities 
other types of market risks generally do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risks  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
management s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using a computer simulation model 
the model measures the change in net interest income which results when market interest rates change 
as of december   an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to have a negative impact of on net interest income over the next twelve month period  while a basis point decrease in market interest rates was estimated to have a positive impact of on the company s net interest income 
by comparison  at december  the company estimated an instantaneous basis point rise in rates would have a negative impact of on net interest income during while a basis point decline in rates would have a positive impact of on net interest income during the company took on slightly more risk to changing interest rates during as it continued to grow its municipal and large certificate of deposit base along with increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
both funding sources have short term repricing characteristics or maturities 
although a considerable amount of the funding was utilized in the making of variable rate commercial loans  the company also increased other loan and investment assets with three to five year repricing characteristics or maturities 
the company believes that the increase in yield for the extended maturities warrants the small increase in its overall interest rate risk 
the potential change in net interest income resulting from this analysis falls within the company s interest rate risk policy guidelines 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit rate changes  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results

the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayment of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the actual maturities and run off of loans could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s historical experience
