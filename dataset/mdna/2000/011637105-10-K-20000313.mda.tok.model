item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of alaris medical and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview alaris medical is a holding company for alaris medical systems 
alaris medical also identifies and evaluates potential acquisitions and investments  and performs various corporate functions 
as a holding company  alaris medical currently has no revenues to fund its operating and interest expense and relies on its existing cash  cash generated from operations of alaris medical systems and external borrowings to meet its obligations 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is a leading provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the united states hospital market  with the largest installed base of pump delivery lines channels 
the company is also a leader in the international infusion systems market 
based on installed base of infusion pumps  the company has a number one or two market position in seven western european countries  the number three market position in three countries  the largest installed base of infusion pumps in australia and canada and a developing position in latin america and asia 
the company s infusion systems  which are used to deliver one or more fluids  primarily pharmaceuticals or nutritionals  to patients  consist of single and multi channel infusion pumps and dedicated and non dedicated disposable administration sets ie  plastic tubing and pump interfaces 
in addition  the company is a leading provider of patient monitoring products that measure and monitor temperature  pulse  pulse oximetry and blood pressure  with the largest installed base of hospital thermometry systems in the united states 
through its july  acquisition of instromedix  the company also designs  manufactures and sells cardiology products such as arrhythmia event recorders and pacemaker monitors 
the company sells a full range of products through a worldwide direct sales force consisting of over sales persons and through more than distributors to over  hospitals worldwide 
sales by the company s international business unit represented of the company s total sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had sales of million and adjusted ebitda of million 
in recent years  the company s results of operations have been affected by the cost containment pressures applicable to health care providers 
in particular  in order to reduce costs  certain hospitals have adopted a protocol increasing the maximum time between disposable administration set changes from every hours to as much as every hours 
notwithstanding this change in protocol  unit sales volume of the company s disposable administration sets increased in every year since  primarily as a result of the growth in its worldwide installed base of infusion pumps 
however  uncertainty remains with regard to future changes within the healthcare industry 
the trend towards managed care and economically motivated buyers in the us may result in continued pressure on selling prices of products and compression on gross margins 
the us marketplace is increasingly characterized by consolidation among healthcare providers and purchasers of medical products 
the company s profitability is affected by the increasing use of group purchasing organizations gpos which are better able to negotiate favorable pricing from providers of infusion systems  such as the company  and which insure compliance with exclusive buying arrangements for their members 
these buying arrangements  in certain situations  also may result in the gpo requiring removal of the company s existing infusion pumps 
the company expects that such gpos will become increasingly more common and may have an adverse effect on the company s future profitability 
finally  the enactment of national health care reform or other legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery could affect the company s future results of operations 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which the company may be affected by any such change in legislation

the company has completed an assessment and it is not currently aware of any material year issues related to third parties  including suppliers  with whom the company conducts business or in its non it systems 
due to the company s inability to control third party  including supplier  compliance with year issues  there can be no assurances that such year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company

infusion instrument sales are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales compensation plans which reward the achievement of annual quotas and the seasonal characteristics of the industry  including hospital purchasing patterns 
first quarter sales are traditionally not as strong as the fourth quarter 
the company anticipates that this trend will continue but is unable to predict the effect  if any  from health care reform  increased competitive pressures and year issues 
approximately and of the company s sales of drug infusion instruments occurred during the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
although the company has dedicated substantial resources towards attaining year readiness  there is no assurance it has been successful in its efforts to identify and address all year issues 
even if the company acted in a timely manner to complete all of its assessments  identify  develop and implement remediation and contingency plans believed to be adequate some problems may not have been identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
the discussion above regarding estimated completion dates  costs  risks and other forward looking statements regarding year is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change

foreign operations the company has significant foreign operations and  as a result  is subject to various risks  including without limitation  foreign currency risks

as part of a comprehensive approach to risk management  the company is presently evaluating alternatives to address this risk 
health care reform heightened public awareness and concerns regarding the growth in overall health care expenditures in the united states may result in the enactment of legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery 
legislation which imposes limits on the number and type of medical procedures which may be performed or which has the effect of restricting a provider s ability to select specific devices or products for use in administrating medical care may adversely impact the demand for the company s products 
in addition  legislation which imposes restrictions on the price which may be charged for medical products may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which the company or the health care industry in general may be adversely affected by the aforementioned in the future
