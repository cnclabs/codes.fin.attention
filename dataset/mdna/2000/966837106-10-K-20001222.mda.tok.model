we operate in one reportable segment  natural foods supermarkets 
all of the company s operations are domestic 
our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings 
new stores may incur operating losses for the first one or two years of operations 
our results of operations are reported on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in september 
fiscal years  and are week years 
fiscal year is a week year 
in november  the company announced that it had adopted a plan to dispose of the naturesmart formerly amrion business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements 
accordingly  the naturesmart business and related net assets have been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented 
the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations

sales sales from continuing operations increased  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
comparable store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market 
these increases are due to such factors as improvements in overall store execution and increased sales of private label products 
gross profit gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations 
the company s gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
these increases reflect increased national buying  category management and private label initiatives  which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis 
additionally  continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement  merchandising and controlling spoilage has contributed to these increases in gross profit 
in all years  gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower spoilage as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in certain departments such as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were in both fiscal years and and in fiscal year fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses reflect higher direct store expenses as a percentage of sales at new and acquired stores added over the last year 
in fiscal year we increased the number of administrative and support personnel at the regional and national levels to support current and planned growth incurred additional costs related to the implementation of new management information systems and procedures required to address our potential year issues 
whole foods market has historically been able to expand without a significant increase in general and administrative costs 
pre opening and relocation costs pre opening costs include hiring and training personnel  supplies  and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings and are incurred primarily in the thirty days prior to a new store opening 
relocation costs consist of moving costs  remaining lease payments  accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities and other related expenses 
the aicpa issued sop reporting on the costs of start up activities in april sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
we adopted sop effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year in accordance with sop  in the first quarter of fiscal year we have reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a one time charge totaling approximately  after taxes  representing start up costs capitalized at september  in fiscal year and prior years  we capitalized pre opening costs as incurred and subsequently expensed such amounts in the quarter of the location opening 
whole foods market developed and opened seventeen stores in fiscal year  nine stores in fiscal year and nine stores in fiscal of these  three stores were relocations in fiscal year  one store in fiscal year and three stores in fiscal year pre opening and relocation costs were approximately million million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
amortization expense amortization expense consists primarily of costs associated with the amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired and non competition agreements 
amortization expense from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year and in both fiscal years and asset disposal costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recognized asset disposal costs totaling approximately million 
costs associated with the disposal of accounting and distribution software which was replaced with the implementation of new financial software totaled approximately million 
costs associated with other hardware and software disposals totaled approximately million and consisted of the writeoffs of certain year non compliant or obsolete hardware and certain software under development that we determined would not be placed in service 
substantially all activities related to the asset disposals were completed in fiscal year interest expense interest expense consists of costs related to the company s convertible subordinated debentures  senior notes and bank line of credit  net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software 
interest expense related to our company s borrowings  net of amounts capitalized  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the annual increases in net interest expense are due primarily to additional amounts outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
investment and other income loss during fiscal year  we determined that recent events and circumstances  including the apparent inability of the investee to obtain additional funding  had caused a decline in value that was other than temporary of our preferred stock investment in american wholehealth  inc as a result of this decline in value  in fiscal year we recognized a million pre tax loss associated with the writeoff of the company s preferred stock investment in american wholehealth  inc investment and other income loss for fiscal year also includes interest  rental and other income totaling approximately million 
investment and other income loss for fiscal years and consists primarily of interest income earned on a short term corporate bond portfolio and a prime money market portfolio 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was higher than in prior years due to the writeoff of the company s million investment in american wholehealth  inc and a corresponding valuation allowance that was established on the related deferred tax asset 
excluding the impact of this investment loss  our effective rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year was approximately the lower income tax rate for fiscal year reflects the elimination of the valuation allowance of approximately million previously provided on net operating loss carryforwards assumed in the fresh fields acquisition 
at september   the company had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million 
we consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates represents the company s share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee

in fiscal year  we recorded a loss on disposition of the naturesmart business totaling approximately million  representing the writedown to estimated net realizable value of the business being discontinued  costs associated with the planned disposal  and estimated loss from operations of the discontinued business through the expected date of disposition  net of income tax benefit

quarterly results the first quarter consists of weeks  the second and third quarters each consist of weeks and the fourth quarter consists of or weeks 
fiscal years and are week years with the fourth quarters consisting of weeks 
because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and contains both the thanksgiving and christmas holidays  it typically represents a larger share of our annual sales from existing stores 
we adopted sop  which requires costs of start up activities to be expensed as incurred  effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year in fiscal year and prior years  we capitalized pre opening costs as incurred and subsequently expensed such amounts in the quarter of the location opening 
quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings 
we believe that the historical pattern of quarterly sales and income as a percentage of the annual total may not be indicative of the pattern in future years
