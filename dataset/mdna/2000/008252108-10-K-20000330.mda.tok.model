in connection with out initial public offering in november  we raised million from the sale of million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock converted to shares of common stock 
in march  we raised million from our sale of an additional million shares of common stock 
as defined by note on page as defined by note on page intangible assets have increased with each new investment in an affiliate 
from our inception through december   we made investments in fourteen affiliates 
overview we buy and hold equity interests in mid sized investment management firms our affiliates and currently derive all of our revenues from those firms 
we hold investments in affiliates that in aggregate managed billion in assets at december  our most recent investments were rorer january  managers april and frontier january 
we have a revenue sharing arrangement with each of our affiliates other than managers which allocates a specified percentage of revenues typically for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses  including salaries and bonuses the operating allocation 
the remaining portion of revenues of each such affiliate  typically the owners allocation  is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including amg  generally in proportion to their ownership of the affiliate 
at some affiliates  we receive a guaranteed payment for the use of our capital or a license fee which in each case is paid from that portion of revenues which we refer to as our owners allocation 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for the managers of these affiliates by allowing them to participate in their firm s growth through their compensation from the operating allocation  to receive a portion of the owners allocation based on their ownership interest in the affiliate  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation which is available for growth initiatives and bonuses for management of such affiliate 
under the revenue sharing arrangements  the managers of our affiliates have an incentive to both increase revenues of the affiliate thereby increasing the operating allocation and their owners allocation and to control expenses of the affiliate thereby increasing the excess operating allocation 
the revenue sharing arrangements allow us to participate in the revenue growth of our affiliates because we receive a portion of the additional revenue as our share of the owners allocation 
however  we participate in that growth to a lesser extent than the managers of our affiliates  because we do not share in the growth of the operating allocation 
under the organizational documents of the affiliates other than managers  the allocations and distributions of cash to us generally take priority over the allocations and distributions to the other owners of the affiliates 
this further protects us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of an affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s management owners  until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of future affiliate management owners allocation 
unlike all other affiliates  managers is not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement since we own substantially all of the firm 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenues or expenses of managers 
the portion of our affiliates revenues which is included in their operating allocation and retained by them to pay salaries  bonuses and other operating expenses  as well as the portion of our affiliates revenues which are included in their owners allocation and distributed to us and the other owners of the affiliates  are included as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
the expenses of our affiliates which are paid out of the operating allocation  as well as our holding company expenses which we pay out of the amounts of the owners allocation which we receive from the affiliates  are both included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
since managers is not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement  all revenues and expenses of managers are consolidated into the revenues and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the portion of our affiliates revenues which is allocated to owners of the affiliates other than us is included in minority interest on our consolidated statements of operations 
the ebitda contribution of an affiliate represents the owners allocation of that affiliate allocated to amg or  in the case of managers  the income allocated to amg before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of that affiliate 
ebitda contribution does not include our holding company expenses 
our revenues are generally derived from the provision of investment management services for fees by our affiliates 
investment management fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain of the affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears  while mutual fund clients are billed based upon daily assets 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  several of the affiliates charge performance based fees to certain of their clients  these performance based fees result in payments to the applicable affiliate based on levels of investment performance achieved 
while the affiliates bill performance based fees at various times throughout the year  the greatest portion of these fees have historically been billed in the fourth quarter in any given year 
all references to assets under management include assets directly managed as well as assets underlying overlay strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities to achieve a particular investment objective 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors including principally i the level of affiliate revenues  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients  and obtaining favorable investment results  ii a variety of factors affecting the securities markets generally  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  iii the receipt of owners allocation  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  iv the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  v our success in attracting new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  vi the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  vii the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for its employees  and viii the level of taxation to which we are subject 
in addition  our profitability will depend upon fees paid on the basis of investment performance at certain of our affiliates 
fees based on investment performance are inherently dependent on investment results  and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
in particular  performance based fees have been of an unusual magnitude in recent years  and may not recur to the same magnitude in future years  if at all 
in addition  while the performance based fee contracts of our affiliates apply to investment management services in a range of investment management styles and securities market sectors  such contracts may be concentrated in certain styles and sectors 
for example  in each of and we benefited from a concentration of such products in technology sectors which performed well in those years 
to the extent such contracts are concentrated within styles or sectors  they are subject to the continuing impact of fluctuating securities prices in such styles and sectors as well as the performance of the relevant affiliates 
assets under management on a historical basis increased by billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in assets under management during the year was principally due to investment performance of billion 
assets under management at our new affiliates at the time of investment billion at rorer  billion at managers and first quadrant s purchase of objective billion also contributed to the increase in assets under management 
net client cash flows for directly managed assets increased by billion  offset by a decline in overlay assets which generally carry lower fees than directly managed assets of billion for the year 
our investments have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under which goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition of interests in affiliates over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including acquired client relationships 
as a result of our investments  intangible assets  consisting of acquired client relationships and goodwill  constitute a substantial percentage of our consolidated assets 
as of december   our total assets were approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of acquired client relationships and million consisted of goodwill 
the amortization period for intangible assets for each investment is assessed individually  with amortization periods for our investments to date ranging from eight to years in the case of acquired client relationships and to years in the case of goodwill 
in determining the amortization period for intangible assets acquired  we consider a number of factors including the firm s historical and potential future operating performance and rate of attrition among clients  the stability and longevity of existing client relationships  the firm s recent  as well as long term  investment performance  the characteristics of the firm s products and investment styles  the stability and depth of the firm s management team and the firm s history and perceived franchise or brand value 
we perform a quarterly evaluation of intangible assets on an investment by investment basis to determine whether there has been any impairment in their carrying value or their useful lives 
if impairment is indicated  then the carrying amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  will be reduced to their fair values 
while amortization of intangible assets has been charged to the results of operations and is expected to be a continuing material component of our operating expenses  management believes it is important to distinguish this expense from other operating expenses since such amortization does not require the use of cash 
because of this  and because our distributions from our affiliates are based on their owners allocation  we have provided additional supplemental information in this report for cash related earnings  as an addition to  but not as a substitute for  measures related to net income 
such measures are i ebitda  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of our ability to service debt  to make new investments and meet working capital requirements  and ii cash net income  which we believe is useful to investors as another indicator of funds available which may be used to make new investments  to repay debt obligations  to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock although the company has no current plans to pay dividends 
cash net income has historically been referred to by us as ebitda as adjusted 
results of operations supplemental pro forma information affiliate operations are included in our historical financial statements from their respective dates of investment 
we consolidate affiliates when we own a controlling interest and include in minority interest the portion of capital and owners allocation owned by persons other than us 
because we have made investments in each of the periods for which financial statements are presented  we believe that the operating results for these periods are not directly comparable 
we have provided the following pro forma data  which should be read with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to such statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
all amounts below are pro forma for the inclusion of all investments made as of december  and the frontier investment completed on january  as if such investments occurred on january  unaudited pro forma supplemental information in thousands unless otherwise noted december  pro forma assets under management data in millions assets under management beginning   net client cash flows directly managed assets  net client cash flows overlay assets   market appreciation   assets under management ending   pro forma financial data revenues   owners allocation   ebitda contribution   ebitda   cash net income   reconciliation of ebitda contribution to ebitda total ebitda contribution as above   less holding company expenses   ebitda   historical financial data cash flow from operating activities   cash flow used in investing activities   cash flow from financing activities   ebitda   cash net income   overlay assets are assets managed subject to strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities to add incremental value to directly managed portfolios

as defined in revenue sharing arrangements on page as defined by note on page as defined by note on page as defined by note on page historical year ended december  as compared to year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income resulted primarily from a growth in the ebitda contribution of our affiliates 
this growth resulted from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates principally essex  as well as growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance 
in addition  the new investments we made in and significantly contributed to the growth in ebitda contribution 
we invested in essex in march  dhja in december  rorer in january and managers in april and have included their results from the respective dates of investment

revenues from performance based fees increased from approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  to approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  the increase in performance based fees is primarily the result of performance based fee contracts in place at essex 
performance based fees realized during the year were of an unusual magnitude  and  as they are inherently dependent on investment results  they may not recur to the same magnitude in future years 
operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  compensation and related expenses increased by million to million  amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  and other operating expenses increased by million to million

investment and other income increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   substantially from our allocation of income from capital maintained in affiliate private partnerships 
minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in affiliates owners allocation due to a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense resulted from repayments of senior bank debt with the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in march and cash flow from ongoing operations  and was partially offset by borrowings related to new investments 
in addition  interest expense decreased due to the favorable impact of the public offering on our libor margin as well as a favorable interest rate environment 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense is related principally to the increase in income before taxes in the year ended december  ebitda increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   resulting from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
cash net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  with the exception of the amortization of intangible assets 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income before extraordinary item of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income resulted substantially from net income from new investments 
we invested in gofen and glossberg in may  geocapital in september  tweedy  browne in october  and essex in march collectively  the new affiliates and included their results from the respective dates of investment 
our net loss after extraordinary item of million for the year ended december  resulted from a million extraordinary item  net of related tax benefit  from the write off of debt issuance costs related to the early extinguishment of debt 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the year ended december  such increase was primarily a result of the addition of the new affiliates

minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the addition of the new affiliates 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   as a result of the increased indebtedness incurred in connection with the investments in the new affiliates 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense is principally related to the increase in income before taxes in the year ended december  ebitda increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the inclusion of the new affiliates 
cash net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  before non cash expenses such as amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings  and the issuance of equity securities in public transactions 
we anticipate that we will use cash flow from our operating activities to repay debt  pay interest and income taxes and to finance our working capital needs  and we will use bank borrowings and issue equity and debt securities to finance future investments 
our principal uses of cash have been to make investments  retire indebtedness  pay income taxes  repurchase shares and support our and our affiliates operating activities 
we expect that our principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for additional investments  repayments of debt  including interest payments on outstanding debt  payment of income taxes  repurchase of shares  capital expenditures  distributions to management owners of affiliates  additional investments in existing affiliates  including our purchase of management owners retained equity  and for working capital purposes 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of senior debt under our credit facility of million 
in january  we financed our investment in frontier with a borrowing under the credit facility 
giving effect to the frontier transaction and other borrowing and repayment activity  at march   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million  and the ability to borrow an additional million 
we have the option  with the consent of our lenders  to increase the facility by another million to a total of million 
our borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by pledges of all of our interests in affiliates including all interests which are directly held by us  as well as all interests which are indirectly held by us through wholly owned subsidiaries  which interests represent substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including those which generally prevent us and our affiliates from i incurring additional indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  ii creating any liens or encumbrances on material assets with certain enumerated exceptions  iii selling assets outside the ordinary course of business or making certain fundamental changes with respect to our businesses  including a restriction on our ability to transfer interests in any majority owned affiliate if  as a result of such transfer  we would own less than of such firm  and iv declaring or paying dividends on our common stock 
our credit facility bears interest at either libor plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin 
we pay a commitment fee on the daily unused portion of the facility 
in order to partially offset our exposure to changing interest rates we have entered into interest rate hedging contracts 
see interest rate hedging contracts 
the credit facility matures during december in order to provide the funds necessary for us to continue to acquire interests in investment management firms  including our existing affiliates upon the management owners sales of their retained equity to us  it will be necessary for us to incur  from time to time  additional long term bank debt and or issue equity or debt securities  depending on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or become available on terms acceptable to us 
net cash flow from operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash flow from operating activities from to resulted from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  as well as growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance 
in addition  the new investments made in contributed to the increase in these cash flows 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million  and million  respectively  were used to make investments in affiliates 
in january  we acquired an approximately interest in rorer  a philadelphia based investment adviser 
we paid million in cash for our investment in rorer 
in april  we acquired substantially all of the interests in managers 
we financed these two investments with borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  in january  we acquired an approximately interest in frontier 
the investment in frontier was also financed with a borrowing under our credit facility 
net cash flow from financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal sources of cash from financing activities have been borrowings under senior credit facilities and subordinated debt  and our public offerings 
the uses of cash from financing activities during these periods were for the repayment of debt and notes issued as purchase price consideration and for the repurchase of common stock and payment of debt issuance costs 
in march  we completed a public offering of common stock 
in the offering   shares of common stock were sold  of which  shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling stockholders 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to reduce indebtedness under our credit facility and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders 
in october  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program pursuant to which we can repurchase up to five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions  with the timing of purchases and the amount of stock purchased determined at our discretion 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of in december  we signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire property in prides crossing  massachusetts in anticipation of the development of our future corporate headquarters 
we intend to close our acquisition of the property in the second quarter of the year and to develop the site within twenty four months after closing 
year we and our affiliates transitioned into the year without material disruption to or adverse effect on our businesses 
our year related remediation efforts are complete  although we cannot guarantee that additional year issues will not arise either within our operations or associated with third party service providers 
amg s holding company and affiliates remediation efforts in anticipation of the year problem  we modified  upgraded or replaced computers  software applications and related equipment to the extent required to minimize the probability of a material disruption to our business 
we incurred  of costs in remediating the year problem in the last four years 
each of our affiliates completed its assessment and renovation or replacement of all non compatible systems and the subsequent testing of such systems 
outside service providers in preparing for the year  we closely monitored the progress of all outsider service providers  and we believe our third party service providers have resolved all of their year related issues 
we have to date experienced no material disruptions in service provider operations as a result of the onset of the year and we have no reason to believe that we will experience any disruptions as a result of year issues in the future 
however  as described above  we cannot guarantee that additional year issues will not arise as associated with third party service providers 
interest rate sensitivity our revenues are derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to our debt financing  we are exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we seek to offset such exposure in part by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
see interest rate hedging contracts 
our annual interest expense increases or decreases by  for each of change in interest rates assuming libor is between and and assuming current interest rate margins on current bank debt 
interest rate hedging contracts we seek to offset our exposure under our debt financing arrangements to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
as of december   we were a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of swap contracts which are designed to limit interest rate increases on our borrowings and are linked to the three month libor 
these swap contracts  upon quarterly reset dates  cap interest rates on the notional amounts at rates ranging between and 
when libor is below  our floating interest rate debt is swapped for fixed rate debt at rates ranging between and 
we generally borrow at libor and pay an additional interest margin as described above 
the hedging contracts limit the effects of our payment of interest at equivalent libor rates of or less on up to million of indebtedness 
as of december   we were also a party to a million notional swap contract that limited interest rates on million of the million of swap contracts identified above at 
this contract was designed to limit interest rate increases if floating rate debt was swapped for higher fixed rate debt under the terms of the original swap contracts 
on january   this interest rate swap contract expired 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain such hedging contracts at their existing levels of coverage or that the amount of coverage maintained will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
in addition  as noted above  our existing hedging contracts subject us to the risk of payments of higher interest rates when prevailing libor rates are less than 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no an amendment to fasb statement deferred the effective date of fas to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the implementation of fas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
economic and market conditions the financial markets and the investment management industry in general have experienced both record performance and record growth in recent years 
as one example of investment management industry growth  the assets under management of mutual funds increased to trillion in  the fifth consecutive year of more than growth  according to the investment company institute 
domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance  among other factors  affect the financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry 
we cannot guarantee that broader market performance will be favorable in the future 
any decline in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in our affiliates performance and may cause our affiliates to experience declining assets under management and or fees  which would reduce cash flow distributable to us 
international operations first quadrant limited  a sister company to first quadrant  lp  is organized and headquartered in london  england 
during  first quadrant acquired objective asset management ltd  a london based money manager  and merged it into the operations of first quadrant limited 
tweedy  browne  based in new york  also maintains a research office in london 
in the future  we may seek to invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on first quadrant limited or other non us investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use interest rate swaps to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposures 
these instruments are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
at december   million was subject to interest rate swaps the original swaps  and our exposure was to changes in three month libor rates 
in january  we became a party to additional contracts with a million notional amount the subsequent swaps 
the subsequent swaps expired on january  this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings of the derivative instruments we held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps allow us to achieve a level of variable rate and fixed rate debt that is acceptable to us  and to reduce interest rate exposure 
in each of our interest rate swaps  we have agreed with another party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
under the original swaps  our interest rates on the notional amounts are capped at rates ranging between and upon quarterly reset dates 
in addition  if libor falls below at a quarterly reset date  we are required to make a payment to our counterparty equal to the difference between the interest rate on our floating rate libor debt on an annualized rate of between and  multiplied by the notional principal amount 
the subsequent swaps were designed to limit interest rate increases to on million of the original million notional amount if three month libor rates fell below 
under these derivative instruments  a hypothetical change of percent in three month libor rates  sustained for three months  would have resulted in no loss in earnings 
because our net earnings exposure under the combined debt and interest rate swap was to three month libor rates  any hypothetical loss would be calculated as follows multiplying the notional amount of the swap by the effect of a reduction in libor under the original swaps and interest savings on the underlying debt
