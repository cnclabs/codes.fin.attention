 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company is required to adopt this statement for the year ending march  sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
the company has not determined the effect  if any  that adoption will have on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the company s cash investments and revolving credit facility 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of the company s investment strategy 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and preserves its invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  the company has classified all its marketable debt securities and long term debt investments as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of income or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
information about the company s investment portfolio is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have million effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balance of such debt at march  information about the company s investment portfolio is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the company s designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since the company enters into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
the company operates in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
at march   the company had contracts maturing through april to sell million in foreign currencies  with a fair value of million 
information about the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements
