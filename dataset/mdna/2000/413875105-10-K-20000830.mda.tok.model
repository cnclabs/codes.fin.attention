item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is useful in understanding harris operating results  cash flows  and financial condition 
the discussion is based on harris continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
except for the historical information contained here  the discussions in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
harris actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements below 
results of operations on november   harris completed the spin off of its lanier worldwide  inc subsidiary as an independent  publicly owned company 
additionally  on august   harris completed the sale of substantially all of its semiconductor business 
as a result of these actions  the lanier and semiconductor businesses are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
continuing operations are reported under two segments the government communications segment  which is comprised of the operations of the former electronic systems sector  and the commercial communications segment  which is comprised of the operations of the former communications sector 
the following discussion is on a continuing operations basis 
restructuring in fiscal  harris recorded a million charge million after income tax for the restructuring of its operations 
restructuring actions included a reduction in workforce of approximately employees and provisions for the write down of intangible assets  equipment  and other assets associated with the exit from harris telephone switching and alarm management product lines 
in the third quarter of fiscal  switching business employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and what their specific severance benefits would be 
these employees worked in the marketing  sales  manufacturing  and administrative areas and were primarily located in marin county  california 
as of june   employees had been terminated with the balance to be terminated by september  in june  harris sold the core switch business to teltronics  inc harris also sold the alarm management business to mediation technology corporation in august harris also intends to sell other portions of this product line  including the international activities  during fiscal gains or losses from the sale of these operations are included or will be included in restructuring expenses in the period the sale occurs 
estimated discounted cash flows were used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities in recording the restructuring charge 
cash outlays for restructuring actions will be primarily for severance benefits 
harris expects to pay these benefits ratably over the first two quarters of fiscal from currently available cash sources 
sales from these product lines were million in  million in  and million in operating losses from these product lines were million in  million in  and million in in fiscal  harris recorded a million charge million after income tax for severance costs associated with the restructuring of harris 
in connection with this restructuring  harris identified employee reductions of  all of which occurred during fiscal harris does not anticipate any further restructuring charges with respect to the items noted above in fiscal other than gains or losses that may result from the sale of the exited product lines or restructuring noted above 
for further information  see the restructuring footnote in the notes to financial statements 

table of contents purchased in process research and development in january  harris purchased louth automation  a leading supplier of advanced automation systems for radio and television broadcasters 
harris paid cash in the net amount of approximately million 
the final determination of the purchase price is subject to adjustment 
in connection with the acquisition  harris allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a one time charge to earnings in the third quarter of fiscal in making the purchase price allocation to in process research and development  harris relied on present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs  and an assessment of overall contribution and project risk 
the amounts assigned to the in process research and development were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the fair values assigned to each of the significant projects and the stage of completion are reported below stage of product fair value completion in millions version of adc software media browser news all others to total a discussion of the three most significant projects follows version of the automated device controller adc software base adc product is an all purpose program commercial automation system with the ability to integrate a wide variety of broadcast devices 
version provides a link between traffic  engineering  and on air broadcasting operations 
the primary functions under development include the implementation of network device control protocall and control of hardware and video servers across the network  the ability to use tcp ip and other remote configurations  creation of a driver that will function with proprietary sony protocall  other specific functionality such as spencer still store and duet  and creation of video disk enhancements 
the development of version was initiated in early calendar conceptualization of features  etc the amount of completion is estimated at considering time based  cost based  and milestone based completion measures 
version incorporates significant leverage on existing technology from adc version the degree of leverage was estimated to be 

table of contents media browser media browser will provide scaleable infrastructure that will expedite the simultaneous browsing of broadcast media clips from servers at different locations 
this new functionality will equip the control room with new traffic management and scheduling capabilities 
the development of media browser was initiated in july conceptualization of features  etc the amount of completion is estimated at considering time based  cost based  and milestone based completion measures 
media browser s leverage on existing technology base is estimated at news news will provide new functionality related to three major areas of news broadcast operations news transmission  material acquisition  and material management 
the development of news was initiated in july the amount of completion is estimated at considering time based  cost based  and milestone based completion measures 
news has minimal leverage on existing technology base from adc version the degree of leverage was estimated at 
there is no previous version of the news product 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a discount rate of percent 
remaining development efforts for these in process research and development projects include various phases of design  development  and testing 
the anticipated completion dates for the in process research and development projects will occur within the next twelve months  after which harris expects to begin generating economic benefits from the technologies over a seven year life cycle 
expenditures to complete these projects are expected to total million 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
we expect to continue these development efforts and believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  there is a risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will attain either technological or commercial success 
fiscal compared with revenue and operating income by segment revenue for fiscal was  million  an increase of percent compared to the prior year 
operating income in fiscal was million versus million for the prior year 

table of contents segment revenue and operating income were as follows percent increase decrease in millions revenue government communications commercial communications total revenue   operating income government communications of revenue commercial communications of revenue headquarters expense other income total operating income of revenue fiscal includes a million restructuring expense and a million write off of purchased in process research and development 
fiscal includes a million special charge for a litigation settlement 
fiscal includes a million restructuring expense 
fiscal includes a million gain from the sale of intersil holding corporation stock 
government communications segment government communications segment revenue in fiscal increased percent from the prior year  and operating income increased percent 
these results were impacted by an million write off in fiscal for the settlement of claims and unrecoverable contract development costs on two contracts 
excluding this write off  revenues declined one percent and operating income declined percent from fiscal despite improved operating margins on more recent contract awards in  operating income has been impacted by margin pressure from poorer performing older contracts 
revenue growth and operating income improved significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal backlog continued to build reflecting a robust win rate percentage and increased spending by the us government for defense 
commercial communications segment commercial communications segment revenue in fiscal increased percent over excluding sales from the recently exited telephone switching product line  the commercial communications segment s sales increased from million to million  or percent 
this segment experienced double digit growth in all four of the segment s major continuing commercial product lines microwave  network support  broadcast  and tactical radio 
these revenue increases were partially offset by a percent decrease in revenue from the recently exited telephone switching and alarm management product lines 
the segment s operating loss for was impacted by the million restructuring charge and the million purchased in process research and development write off mentioned previously  as well as a million write down of inventory related to the telephone switching and alarm management product lines that were exited 
these product lines also incurred an additional million in operating losses in compared to a loss of million in the segment s fiscal operating loss also includes transition costs of million associated with exiting these product lines 
such costs included relocation of the network support business unit s headquarters from marin county  california to melbourne  florida  collection losses on accounts receivable  and excess manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in marin county 
harris ceased all marketing  sales  and research and development for the telephone switching and alarm management 
table of contents product lines as of february the operating losses through february included a significant amount of marketing and sales expenses  as well as research and development costs in the telephone switching product line 
excluding the items mentioned above in both the current and prior year  as well as a million special charge for a patent litigation settlement in the prior year  the commercial communications segment s operating income increased from million in to million in  or percent 
the increase in operating income was driven mainly by the percent sales growth in the commercial communications segment s continuing commercial product lines 
orders and revenue increased for microwave radios during the year as markets continued to rebound in north america  latin america  and china 
in june  harris completed the acquisition of the point to point microwave business of trt lucent technologies 
the acquisition provides for a five year preferred supplier agreement to serve the worldwide point to point microwave needs of lucent s wireless divisions 
in the first quarter of fiscal  harris also entered into agreements to acquire wavtrace  inc  a privately held  leading developer of broadband wireless access systems 
the acquisition when completed is expected to support harris initiative to lead the world in the delivery of point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access solutions for microwave and millimeter wave frequencies 
the broadcast communications business reported a strong increase in revenues due primarily to its new studio automation business  which was bolstered by the purchase of louth automation  the leading supplier of advanced automation systems for digital television  over the air broadcast  and cable and industrial applications 
the acquisition of louth automation brings competencies in automation and control to complement harris leadership position in broadcast transmission and digital encoding 
this acquisition further broadens harris global position in the broadcast markets 
the tactical radio product line experienced a significant increase in sales as it continues to benefit from the market s enthusiasm for its high data rate  multiband  secure radios which were introduced in fiscal to meet the growing bandwidth requirement as digital technology is embraced by the military 
orders and revenues also increased substantially for the network support business 
this increase was aided by increased demand for the telecom line test systems used by competitive local exchange carriers clecs to deploy digital subscriber lines dsls for applications such as high speed internet service and other broadband communication services for voice  data  and video 

table of contents comparative statement of income harris comparative statement of income is as follows percent increase decrease in millions revenue from product sales and services   cost of product sales and services   gross margin of revenue engineering  selling and administrative expenses of revenue amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring expenses purchased in process research and development special charge for litigation other income operating income of revenue interest income interest expense income from continuing operations before taxes of revenue income taxes income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of revenue gross margin the gross margin as a percent of revenue was percent in fiscal compared to percent in the decline in gross margins was primarily due to a million write down of inventory and lower gross margin related to the telephone switching product line that was exited 
excluding the impact of this exited product line  gross margin as a percent of revenue was percent in compared to percent in the increase is due to improved gross margins in harris commercial communications segment s broadcast  network support  and microwave radio product lines 
engineering  selling and administrative expenses engineering  selling  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal operating expenses were impacted by million of transition costs associated with exiting the telephone switching product line 
such costs include relocation of the network support business unit s headquarters from marin county  california to melbourne  florida  collection losses on accounts receivable  and excess manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in marin county 
the operating expenses were also impacted by administrative and general  marketing and sales  and research and development expenses in the telephone switching product line in the first half of the fiscal year 
excluding the impact of the exited product line  operating expenses as a percent of revenue were percent in versus percent in the increase was primarily due to planned increases in selling and engineering  research and development expenses  as well as increased headquarters expenses 
the increased headquarters expenses were primarily attributable to unusually low executive compensation in fiscal and costs associated with the centralization of company wide shared services in fiscal goodwill amortization goodwill amortization increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to acquisitions made in harris broadcast systems product line during fiscal  primarily the acquisition of louth automation 

table of contents other income other income increased from million in to million in due primarily to a million gain from the sale of one million shares of intersil holding corporation stock as a part of intersil holding corporation s initial public offering 
the remaining increase was due to gains on the sale and redemption of other securities partially offset by lower income from harris equity investments 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased from million in to million in due to higher cash balances that resulted from the sale of the semiconductor business and the spin off of lanier worldwide  inc interest expense increased from million in to million in due to a higher allocation of interest expense to the results of discontinued operations in the prior year 
total interest expense from both continuing operations and discontinued operations decreased from million in to million in this decrease is due to the repayment of short term debt with the cash received from the sale of the semiconductor business and the spin off of lanier worldwide  inc and lower interest rates 
income taxes the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was percent in fiscal versus percent in the prior year 
both and benefited from tax rates on foreign source income and export sales  which offset the additional provision needed for state income taxes 
return on revenue income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue was percent in versus percent in the reduction was primarily due to restructuring expenses  purchased in process research and development  and the transition costs and operating losses of exited product lines which were partially offset by the gain from sales of intersil holding corporation stock 
excluding these items  income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased from percent in to percent in selected financial information relating to geographical regions and export sales is set forth in the note business segments in the notes to financial statements 
fiscal compared with net sales and operating income revenue from product sales and services decreased percent to billion in fiscal  from billion in fiscal income from continuing operations before extraordinary item was million  down percent from million in fiscal income from continuing operations before extraordinary item in fiscal included a restructuring charge for employee reductions of million  a one time million charge for litigation costs for the settlement of a patent litigation relating to an older product no longer manufactured by the company  and an million charge for settlement of claims and unrecoverable contract development costs on two contracts 
prior year income from continuing operations includes million of restructuring expenses and a million provision for costs associated with a malaysian contract 
excluding all of the above items for both years  income from continuing operations declined approximately percent in fiscal net sales for the government communications segment in fiscal were million  percent lower than the prior year  while operating profit increased percent to million 
excluding prior year restructuring charges and unusual long term contract charges in both years million in fiscal and million in fiscal  operating profit increased percent in fiscal lower sales in the segment s information systems and aerospace systems product lines more than offset growth in the communications systems product line 
lower sales in information systems and aerospace systems was primarily attributable to declining order backlog 
the increase in operating profit was related to final settlement of prior year s overhead rates and to increased gross margins resulting from a more favorable contract mix 
commercial communications segment sales decreased percent to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal excluding a fiscal one time million charge for litigation costs and a fiscal restructuring charge of million  operating profit declined percent to million from million in fiscal significantly lower sales and gross margins in the segment s microwave radio and digital switch product lines offset modest improvement in sales and earnings for the segment s broadcast equipment product line 
lower sales in the microwave product lines resulted primarily from weak international 
table of contents markets and lower than expected pcs growth in the north american market 
as a result  overcapacity in the industry caused severe pricing pressures and margin erosion 
there also was a significant reduction in foreign sales for digital switch products 
sales for the segment s radio communication product line were marginally higher than the prior year while operating profit was relatively unchanged 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services was billion in fiscal costs as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to improved gross margins in the company s government communications segment which were partially offset by the decline in the gross margins in the commercial communications segment 
operating expenses engineering  selling  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were percent in  up slightly from percent in the prior year 
higher expenditures for marketing and company sponsored research and development were offset by lower administrative expenses for the year 
headquarters expense  which is included in administrative expenses  was million lower than fiscal due to lower expenses associated with the employee benefit plans and a continued emphasis on cost controls 
other income and expense interest expense was lower in fiscal due to a lower level of borrowings from continuing operations in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense is allocated to the company s discontinued operations based upon the capital employed by the business 
interest expense before allocations to discontinued operations increased from million to million due to higher borrowings and higher interest rates 
other income was million lower in fiscal due primarily to lower amounts of gains from the sale of investment securities and lower royalty income compared to fiscal the provision for income taxes from continuing operations as a percentage of income before income taxes was percent in both fiscal and fiscal the increase from the statutory us income tax rate of percent in both years was due primarily to provisions for state income taxes 
liquidity and financial position harris comparative financial position is as follows percent increase decrease in millions except per share amounts cash and marketable securities other current assets current liabilities working capital  of revenue intangibles resulting from acquisitions non current deferred income taxes total debt total shareholders equity   total debt as a of total capital book value per share purchase of common stock for treasury  additions of plant and equipment cash and marketable securities harris completed several transactions that resulted in significant cash receipts including million from the sale of it semiconductor business to intersil corporation  million from the lanier worldwide  inc spin off  and million from the payment of a note and the sale of intersil holding corporation shares as a result of the initial public offering of intersil holding corporation 
harris has used a portion of this cash to reduce total debt by million  to repurchase harris common stock  and 
table of contents for other general corporate purposes  such as the acquisitions of louth automation and trt lucent technologies point to point microwave radio business 
harris plans to use its remaining cash balances for similar general corporate purposes in the future  such as acquisitions and repurchases of its common stock 
marketable securities increased from million as of july  to million as of june  the increase was primarily due to harris holdings in intersil holding corporation and airnet communications corporation  each of which completed initial public offerings during fiscal harris also has available a million syndicated credit facility and a million shelf registration 
management currently believes that existing cash  funds generated from operations  sales of marketable securities  the credit facility  and access to the public debt markets will be sufficient to provide for harris anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and any additional stock repurchases under the current repurchase program for the next twelve months 
working capital working capital increased million from million as of july  to  million as of june  also  total debt decreased from million to million for the same periods 
these changes were largely due to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents  a million decrease in short term debt due to the sale of harris semiconductor operation and the spin off of lanier worldwide  inc  and a million increase in marketable securities noted above 
these increases were partially offset by a million change in current deferred income taxes related primarily to unrealized gains on marketable securities  increased receivables due to more extended terms in harris commercial communications segment  and a decrease in accounts payable 
intangibles resulting from acquisitions intangibles resulting from acquisitions increased from million as of july  to million as of june  the increase was due primarily to goodwill recorded as a result of the louth automation acquisition and intellectual property associated with the trt lucent technologies point to point microwave radio business acquisition 
non current deferred income taxes the liability for non current deferred income taxes was million as of june  versus million as of july  the decrease was due primarily to lower amounts of timing differences related to accruals and depreciation partially offset by more timing differences related to international tax loss carryforwards 
total debt and capitalization at june   debt totaled million  representing percent of total capital defined as the sum of total debt plus shareholders equity 
a year earlier  debt of million was percent of total capital 
cash received from the sale of harris semiconductor operation and the spin off of lanier worldwide  inc was used to decrease the debt balance 
year end long term debt included million of debentures  million of notes payable to banks  and million of other long term debt 
in  harris issued  shares of common stock to employees under the terms of harris stock purchase  option  and incentive plans 
harris debt is currently rated bbb by standard and poor s ratings group and baa by moody s investors service 
harris expects to maintain operating ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios  and balance sheet ratios sufficient for retention of these debt ratings 
purchase of common stock for treasury harris used million to repurchase million shares of its common stock in fiscal compared to million to purchase million shares in fiscal harris board of directors has approved a share repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of up to million shares through open market transactions  in negotiated block transactions or pursuant to tender offers 
additions of plant and equipment additions of plant and equipment for were million versus million in the increase is due to the purchase of a new headquarters building for harris broadcast communications operation in mason  ohio and the buyout of a lease on a pc board manufacturing plant in san antonio  texas 
harris has outsourced this manufacturing process and is leasing the space to the new manufacturer 
total additions for harris in fiscal are expected to be approximately million 

table of contents retirement plans retirement benefits for substantially all of harris employees are provided primarily through a retirement plan having profit sharing and savings elements 
harris also provides limited health care benefits to retirees who have or more years of service 
all obligations under harris retirement plans have been fully funded by harris contributions  the provision for which totaled million in fiscal impact of foreign exchange approximately percent of harris international business is transacted in local currency environments 
the impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to us dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
at june   the cumulative translation adjustment reduced shareholders equity by million compared to a reduction of million at july  harris utilizes foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions 
gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on harris results in   or impact of inflation to the extent feasible  harris has consistently followed the practice of adjusting its prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
market risk management harris  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the market value of its equity securities available for sale  and changes in interest rates 
harris employs established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
harris uses foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off balance sheet foreign currency commitments 
specifically  these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from suppliers  and accounts receivable from and future committed sales to customers  and intercompany loans 
management believes the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks  which arise from doing business in international markets 
contracts are generally one year or less 
at june   harris had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  of which million were to hedge off balance sheet commitments 
at july   harris had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  of which million was to hedge off balance sheet commitments 
additionally  for the fiscal year ended june   harris purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward and option contracts  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
harris hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of harris hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets  and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a percent adverse change in currency exchange rates for harris foreign currency derivatives held at june  would have an impact of approximately million on the fair value of such instruments 
this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of harris foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
harris also maintains a portfolio of marketable equity securities available for sale 
these investments result from the retained interest in sold or spun off businesses and the investment in start up companies that have technology or products that are of interest to harris 
the fair market value of these securities at june  was million  compared to million as of july  this increase was due to the initial public offerings of two of these investments and an increase in these securities quoted market prices 
the corresponding unrealized gain is included as a component of shareholders equity 
these investments have historically had higher volatility than most market indices 
a percent adverse change in the quoted market 
table of contents price of marketable equity securities would have an impact of approximately million on the fair market value of these securities 
harris utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
harris does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
environmental matters harris is actively engaged in complying with environmental protection laws 
in addition to ongoing internal compliance programs  an estimated million was spent on environmental capital projects in fiscal and million in fiscal harris estimates that it will authorize million in fiscal for environmental related capital projects 
under the superfund act or similar state environmental laws  harris also has potential liability at various waste sites designated for clean up 
harris is named as a potentially responsible party at eleven such sites where future liabilities could exist 
these sites include two harris owned sites  four sites associated with former harris locations  and five non harris owned treatment or disposal sites  allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to harris from past operations 
harris routinely assesses its contingencies  obligations  and commitments to clean up and monitor sites in light of in depth studies  analysis by environmental experts  and legal reviews 
at the two harris owned sites and four sites associated with former harris locations  harris is involved primarily in monitoring and remediation programs that have been implemented in cooperation with various environmental agencies 
at the other sites  harris is involved as one of numerous potentially responsible parties prps 
in ascertaining environmental exposures  management must assess the extent of contamination  the nature of remedial actions  continually evolving governmental standards  and the number  participation level  and financial viability of other prps and other similar variables 
based upon internal and third party studies  as well as the remediation and monitoring expense history at the two harris owned sites and four sites associated with former harris locations  the number and solvency of prps at the other sites  and an assessment of other relevant factors  harris has estimated that its discounted liability under the superfund act and other environmental statutes and regulations for identified sites  using a percent discount rate  is approximately million 
harris has accrued these discounted liabilities 
the expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next to years depending on the number of years for each site is approximately million 
the expected payments for the next five years are million  million  million  million  million  and the aggregate amount thereafter is approximately million 
year issue the year statements set forth below are designated as year readiness disclosures pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act 
certain software and hardware systems are time sensitive 
older time sensitive systems often use a two digit dating convention eg  rather than that could result in system failure and disruption of operations in and later years 
during the past several years harris diligently addressed the potential year problem by undertaking remediation project initiatives relating to four basic aspects of harris and its business operations internal information technology systems  including sales order processing  contract management  financial systems  and service management  internal non information technology systems  including office equipment and test equipment  products and services  and material third party relationships 
harris completed all these initiatives at the originally estimated cost of million dollars 
this cost was generally not incremental to existing information technology budgets 
harris did not experience any significant business disruptions or system failures as a result of year issues 
further  there have been no substantial year related issues reported from our major suppliers or customers 

table of contents although the year event has occurred  and while there can be no assurance that there will be no problems related to the year for a period of time after january   harris believes it has not and will not be adversely impacted by year issues 
outlook the outlook for fiscal is for strong growth in sales and earnings  building on the momentum established during the past year 
the major repositioning actions have been completed  yielding reductions in overhead costs and much tighter integration of harris 
although profit margins are low by historical standards as harris ends the repositioning period  harris expects to see continued improvement  quarter by quarter  during the coming year 
harris also expects to accomplish additional acquisitions to further strengthen harris position in markets that it serves
