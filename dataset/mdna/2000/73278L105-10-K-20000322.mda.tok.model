item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of swimming pool equipment  parts and supplies  including chemicals  cleaners  packaged pools and liners  filters  heaters  pumps  lights  repair parts and other equipment required to build  maintain  install and overhaul residential and small commercial swimming pools 
the company sells its products primarily to swimming pool remodelers and builders  independent swimming pool retailers and swimming pool repair and service companies 
these customers tend to be small  family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 
the company maintains a strict credit policy 
losses from customer receivables have historically been within management s expectations 
the swimming pool supply industry is affected by various factors including general economic conditions  consumer saving and discretionary spending levels  the level of new housing construction  weather and consumer attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons 
although management believes that the company s geographic diversity could mitigate the effect of a regional economic downturn and that the continuing maintenance and repair needs for existing swimming pools could mitigate the effect of a general economic downturn  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations and expansion plans would not be materially adversely affected by any of such downturns 
the principal components of the company s expenses include the cost of products purchased from manufacturers and operating expenses which are primarily related to labor  occupancy  marketing and selling and administrative expenses 
in response to competitive pressures from any of its current or future competitors  the company may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share  and such measures could adversely affect the company s gross margins and operating results 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  information derived from the consolidated statements of income of the company expressed as a percentage of net sales for such year 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses goodwill amortization operating income interest expense amortization expense other income income before income taxes and change in accounting principle the following discussion compares the results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  and the results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in an increase of in sales at service centers open at least months contributed million to the increase  service centers acquired in the benson acquisition in contributed million to the increase  and service centers acquired from the spw acquisition  the glp acquisition and the albouy acquisition the european acquisitions contributed million to the increase 
the balance of the increase was attributable to sales at consolidated and new service centers open less than months 
results of operations continued gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in an increase in same store gross profits of accounted for million of the increase  while consolidated and new service centers open less than months accounted for million of the increase 
the benson acquisition and the european acquisitions accounted for the remaining increase 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in the period from in the period 
the increase in gross profit was realized in the majority of markets across the united states in and is attributable to an increased focus on pricing and purchasing disciplines 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the comparable period 
consolidated and new service centers open less than months accounted for million of the increase  and service centers open at least months accounted for million of the increase 
this increase also reflects an additional million and million of operating expenses incurred at service centers acquired in the benson acquisition and the european acquisitions  respectively 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased compared to interest and other expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the comparable period 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization expense of million 
this increase is offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower average outstanding debt levels between periods 
additionally  miscellaneous expense increased million from the comparable period primarily due to the write off of certain computer equipment replaced in connection with improvements to the company s information system and year efforts 
income taxes increased million to million for compared to million for primarily due to the million increase in income before income taxes and change in accounting principle 
the company s effective tax rate remained constant at in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
service centers acquired in contributed million to the increase  sales at newly opened centers accounted for million of the total increase  and an increase of approximately in sales at service centers open at least months contributed million 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved to in the period from in the period due primarily to higher margins at service centers acquired in the bhd acquisition and also due to improved margins in california  florida and the central united states compared to the same period in the previous year 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
this increase is reflective of salaries  occupancy expenses and other costs associated with new service centers  and  to a lesser extent  payroll and other operating costs required to support the increased sales volume at existing service centers 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in the period compared to in the period primarily as a result of greater internal operating efficiencies 
interest and other expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense resulting from lower average outstanding debt levels between periods and a more favorable interest rate on the senior loan facility 
income taxes increased million to million for compared to million for primarily due to the million increase in income before income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to for from for as a result of decreases in the company s blended state income tax rate 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is highly seasonal 
in general  sales and net income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when the company may incur net losses 
the company experiences a build up of inventory and accounts payable during the first and second quarters of the year in anticipation of the peak swimming pool supply selling season 
the company s peak borrowing occurs during the second quarter primarily because dated accounts payable offered by the company s suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while the company s peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
to encourage preseason orders  the company  like many other swimming pool supply distributors  utilizes preseason sales programs that provide for extended dating terms and other incentives to its customers 
some of the company s suppliers also offer extended dating terms on certain products to the company for preseason or early season purchases 
in offering extended dating terms to its customers and accepting extended dating terms from its suppliers  the company effectively finances a portion of its receivables with extended payables 
the company expects that its quarterly results of operations will fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new service centers and acquisitions 
the company attempts to open its new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the beginning of the first quarter to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the peak season 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for and  which  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of such data 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 
quarter dollars  in thousands first second third fourth first second third fourth net sales        gross profit        operating income loss       net sales as a percentage of annual net sales gross profit as a percentage of annual gross profit operating income as a percentage of annual operating income liquidity and capital resources currently  the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and borrowings under a senior loan facility consisting of a term loan and a revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit has a total borrowing capacity of million 
the company s borrowings under its credit facility  together with cash flow from operations and seller financing  historically have been sufficient to support the company s growth and to finance acquisitions 
considering the company s borrowing base as of december   the company had million available for borrowing under its senior loan facility  the only additional credit source currently available to the company 
during the twelve months ended december   the company made net payments on its revolver loan of million and made scheduled principal payments of million required under its senior loan facility 
liquidity and capital resources continued borrowings under the senior loan facility may  at the company s option  bear interest at either i the agent s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus  whichever is higher  plus a margin ranging from to or ii libor plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on the company s leverage ratio 
substantially all of the assets of the company  including the capital stock of scp  secure the company s obligations under the senior loan facility 
the senior loan facility has numerous restrictive covenants which require the company to maintain minimum levels of interest coverage and fixed charge coverage and which also restrict the company s ability to pay dividends and make capital expenditures 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants and financial ratio requirements 
the senior loan facility matures on december  between february  and march  and between august  and september   the company purchased  and  shares  respectively  of its common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program announced in october see share repurchase program 
certain intercompany dividends paid prior to march  by the company created covenant defaults under the senior loan facility 
the lenders under the senior loan facility have waived such defaults in accordance with the provisions of the senior loan facility 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in an increase in net income provided million of the increase while a decrease in use of cash for operating assets  liabilities and activities provided the remaining million 
the decrease in use of cash is primarily due to improved management of working capital 
with the exception of the bhd acquisition in  which was financed through the issuance of common stock to the public  the company s acquisitions have been financed primarily by borrowings under its credit facilities and by seller financing 
to finance future acquisitions  the company may utilize its ability to borrow additional funds under the senior loan facility or  depending on market conditions  incur additional indebtedness or issue common or preferred stock which may be issued to third parties or to sellers of acquired businesses 
share repurchase program in october  the company announced that it may purchase in the open market or directly from stockholders up to million of common stock of the company over a twelve month period at prices deemed appropriate by the company 
as of february   the company had purchased a total of  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
in addition  in november  the company announced that its board authorized an additional million for the purchase of the company s common stock over the following year 
as of february   the company had not purchased any shares with the additional million authorized 
intangible assets at december   the company had net intangible assets which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
these net intangible assets consist primarily of million net of accumulated amortization  or of the company s goodwill balance  which arose at the time the company was established on december  in a leveraged buyout transaction 
the remainder has arisen in connection with the company s subsequent acquisitions since its formation in intangible assets continued goodwill is amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in assigning such amortization periods  the company considered the following factors i projected future cash flows of the acquired business  ii effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life  and iii the expected actions of competitors and others that may restrict present competitive advantages 
management periodically assesses the recoverability of goodwill and considers whether the goodwill should be completely or partially written off or the amortization period accelerated 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the policy for evaluating goodwill for impairment 
at december   management determined that there is no persuasive evidence that any material portion of goodwill will dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization period used 
year issue as a result of the company s year planning and remediation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems 
the company incurred costs totaling  during the second quarter of to upgrade its main system server 
the company believes this cost was not primarily related to year issues 
during the third quarter of  the company incurred approximately  in consulting fees for year contingency planning 
the costs to address year issues were funded from cash generated from operations and from the borrowing capacity under the senior loan facility 
the company is not aware of any other material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
the company has not used derivative instruments to engage in speculative transactions or hedging activities
