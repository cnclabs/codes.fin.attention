item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture and sell process automation systems  integrating electro optical inspection and sorting  specialized conveying and processing and preparation equipment 
the company consists of key technology  inc which directly owns four subsidiaries key technology fsc  inc  a foreign sales corporation fsc  key holdings usa llc  key technology amvc llc  and ventek  inc key holdings usa llc owns suplusco holdings bv  its european subsidiary  which owns key technology bv key technology amvc llc owns als  inc and arc netherlands bv the company manufactures products in walla walla  washington  redmond  oregon  eugene  oregon  medford  oregon and beusichem  the netherlands 
through the maintenance of its wholly owned foreign sales corporation subsidiary  key technology fsc  inc  a portion of the company s domestically originated foreign trade income is exempt from tax at the corporate level 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and  the company s net sales were million  million  and million  respectively 
sales of automated inspection systems and parts and service contracts increased by and  respectively  but was more than offset by decreases in specialized conveying systems and processing and preparation equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal sales for the year ended september  were unfavorably affected by market factors including o consolidation among food processors which resulted in delayed investments in capital equipment by key s customers  o softness in the vegetable industry caused by processed inventories carried over from the previous season and lower prices for customers products  o customers higher costs of capital due to increased interest rates in the united states  which has delayed certain projects  and o the strength of the us dollar on the world markets  which has made us manufactured goods relatively more expensive to foreign customers 
the company did not experience a comparable level of turn key sales in fiscal that it experienced in fiscal  most notably from the vegetable industry 
these turn key sales incorporate the company s conveying and processing systems together with other third party supplied equipment into entire processing lines 
sales by subsidiaries acquired during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal contributed approximately million to the company s consolidated gross sales in fiscal  of which million was in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  the company anticipates increases in sales due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal  increases in sales to the tobacco industry  increases in sales to international markets and large expansion projects projected by the company s customers  principally in the french fry industry 
net sales in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the increased sales in fiscal resulted principally from a million or increase sales of in specialized conveying systems followed by a increase in process and preparation systems and a increase in parts and service contracts 
sales of automated inspection systems increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in sales during fiscal for both the specialized conveying systems and the process and preparation systems resulted principally from sales of larger turn key processing line systems 
the increase in sales of parts and service contracts in fiscal compared to was principally the result of the introduction early in fiscal of a new multi level service product offering named uptime 
the increase in sales of automated inspection systems resulted principally from increased sales of accuscan r and adr systems  partially offset by decreased sales of tegra systems 
sales of automated inspection systems to european and other international customers increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal export and foreign sales accounted for  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
an increase in sales to domestic customers of was more than offset by a decrease in sales to foreign customers in fiscal the largest market for such foreign sales in each of the three fiscal years was to european customers 
gross profit was  and of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the gross margin  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  benefited from improved margins in automated inspection systems and in parts and service  offset by decreased gross margins in specialized conveying systems and process and preparation systems 
automated inspection system gross margins  as a percent of sales  improved two percentage points in fiscal over fiscal  principally the result of an decrease in warranty costs  which continued the favorable trend of a decrease in warranty costs in the previous year 
in addition  the ventek products carry a higher margin  which favorably affected the automated inspection systems product group 
decreased specialized conveying system gross margins were principally due to an increase in manufacturing overhead resulting from decreased production volumes between the two comparable periods 
the gross margins for parts and service contracts improved principally as a result of increased volume of higher margin upgrades 
process and preparation system revenues in both fiscal and included a variety of third party supplied equipment and installation services which were sold at very low margins as components of larger processing lines 
during fiscal  the third party supplied products accounted for approximately million of million in total net sales of process and preparation systems compared to million of the million in total net sales in fiscal the company anticipates that gross margins for fiscal will improve over those experienced in previous years due to higher margins carried by acquired product lines  efficiencies gained from the manufacture of all automated inspection systems in one facility  and higher volumes and economies of scale that can be achieved as a result of the fiscal acquisitions 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal due to the addition of operating expenses for the acquired companies  a one time charge of million of expenses for acquired in process research and development  non recurring integration costs totaling  and incremental amortization of  for acquired intangibles 
the company expects that  as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses in fiscal should be closer to those experienced prior to fiscal selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased over fiscal  principally due to the expenses contributed by the acquisitions 
the company also increased investments in new product promotions related to four new products introduced in fiscal and expanded sales coverage to european and latin american markets 
selling and marketing expenses in fiscal increased compared to fiscal  resulting principally from increased commission expenses related to the higher level of product sales combined with an increased volume and percentage of those sales sold through outside representatives to whom the company pays higher commission rates  increased staff costs and increased advertising and product promotion expenses 
the company expects to reduce its selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales as a result of reorganization of its sales and distribution channels and an anticipated reduction in investments related to new product introductions 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased by approximately compared to principally due to expenses contributed by acquisitions 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased by approximately compared to as a result of an increased level of engineering costs charged to cost of sales as a direct result of the increased sales volume  particularly in the company s specialized conveying product group 
however  research and development expenses related to new product development projects increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of activities devoted to developing the new fourth generation adr product and new specialized conveying system products 
the company expects research and development expenses  as a percentage of fiscal net sales  to approximate fiscal levels 
activities in fiscal will focus on continuing to extend the capabilities and applications of the technologies contained in tegra and prism  and continuing to develop new specialized conveying system products 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by approximately compared to fiscal principally due to expenses contributed by acquisitions 
during fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased approximately compared to fiscal due principally to increased incentive compensation related to the company s increased level of profitability and increased consulting and professional service expenses  partially offset by decreased costs for doubtful accounts receivable 
as a percentage of net sales  the company expects general and administrative expenses in fiscal to approximate those levels experienced in previous years 
the increase in amortization of intangibles and the one time charge for acquired in process research and development costs are due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal the company obtained independent appraisals of the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired 
acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  patents  existing technologies and established customer base  are amortized over the shorter of their remaining lives or periods of to years 
a one time charge of million associated with the write off of acquired in process research and development was recorded immediately subsequent to the acquisition of amvc in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal other income and expense includes interest income and expense  royalty income and other income from miscellaneous sources 
net interest expense in fiscal was  compared to net interest income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal decreased net interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from increased interest expense on long term debt arising from the acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by interest earnings on invested cash equivalents and short term investments 
during fiscal  the company received royalty payments of  compared to total royalty income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal as part of a settlement agreement entered into during  the company may receive royalty payments through related to the sale of certain equipment to a selected market 
the payment may be reduced by a percentage of the purchases of equipment from the company by the other party 
the company recognized royalty income from this agreement of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recognized foreign currency conversion losses totaling  on cash and accounts receivable held primarily in euros and dutch guilders 
this compares to foreign currency conversion gains of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate was a tax benefit of in fiscal and tax expense of  and for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective tax benefit or tax expense rate varies from the statutory rate of due to permanent differences in tax obligations arising from activities of the fsc  research and development tax credits  and other permanent differences 
the larger variance from statutory rates in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal is principally due to the taxable net loss reported for the latter period compared to larger taxable net earnings for the previous fiscal years 
net loss after tax was  in fiscal compared to net earnings of million in fiscal and  in fiscal basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to earnings per share of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the net loss of  or per share  for the year ended september  included merger related and one time acquisition costs of million  or million after tax 
excluding merger related and one time acquisition charges  net earnings would have been million or per share for the year ended september  the decrease in net earnings in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to decreased sales volume in the company s core business and the one time acquisition costs and amortization related to acquisitions 
the increase in net earnings in fiscal compared to resulted principally from the increased gross margins due to the increased level of sales  decreased warranty expenses  and decreased manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
the anticipated return on the company s acquisitions during fiscal is dependent upon maintaining and growing total revenues of the combined organization at or above those experienced by the separate companies prior to acquisition and merger and achieving cost reductions of to million in manufacturing and operating expense categories 
a significant shortfall of actual results compared to anticipated results could have an adverse effect the company s results of operations 
although the company has begun to experience cost savings in fiscal  market  economic or other factors may adversely intervene 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its revenue growth or cost savings objectives 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was affected by a decrease in accounts receivable totaling million that resulted principally from a decrease in sales volume and improved accounts receivable management  compared to cash used due to an increase in accounts receivable totaling million during fiscal  due principally to an increase in sales volume 
accounts receivable balances during fiscal decreased  and cash increased  by million 
operating activities during provided million in cash from a decrease in inventory compared to million used to fund an increase in inventories in fiscal and million provided from a decrease in inventories in decreases in trade accounts payable  accrued payroll liabilities  accrued income taxes and other accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  utilized cash totaling million during fiscal by comparison  the company was provided cash totaling million in fiscal by increases in trade accounts payable  accrued payroll liabilities and accrued income taxes  partially offset by a decrease in accrued customer support and warranty costs 
the company used cash during in the amounts of  to decrease trade accounts payable balances and accrued customer support and warranty costs and to pay accrued income taxes and certain accrued payroll liabilities which had been accrued in previous fiscal years

net proceeds of million arising from the sale and purchase of short term investments in fiscal compared to net investments of  to purchase short term investments in fiscal and no such investments in fiscal the company s cash flows from financing activities were affected by the repayment of long term debt during fiscal  and totaling million   and  respectively 
separately  cash flows from the issuance of long term debt totaled million for fiscal with no such issuance in fiscal and  in fiscal proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans during fiscal  and totaled   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company redeemed for cash warrants totaling  there were no such redemptions in fiscal and the company s facility with a domestic commercial bank provides for operating lines of credit of up to million in three components 
the first component is an unsecured operating line of up to million which expires february  at september  the company had no borrowings under this credit line

at september   the company had no borrowings under this credit facility 
the domestic credit accommodation and the mortgage note payable contain covenants which require certain levels of tangible equity  working capital  ratios of current assets to current liabilities  or debt to equity 
the company was not in compliance with certain covenants at september  the company has obtained temporary waivers of these covenants and has negotiated modifications of the covenants to provide latitude in meeting certain covenants in the future 
the company s operating  investing and financing activities during fiscal resulted in increases in cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to a decrease totaling  in and an increase totaling million in the balance of cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million and million at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and available borrowings under its operating lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for its working capital needs and to fund future internal growth

the maximum cash that could be required totals million 
the redemption of securities is at the option of the security holders until july   at which date any outstanding unconverted preferred stock is mandatorily redeemed by the company 
the market price of the company s common stock will determine timing and occurrence of redemption of these securities 
a price of per share or more on or prior to july  could motivate holders to convert their preferred stock to common stock 
at december   holders of  warrants of the  warrants issued had redeemed for cash their warrants at each 
if the company is not able to sustain operating cash through normal operations or were required to redeem for cash the preferred stock and remaining warrants  it may have to rely on additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance the company would be able to obtain future financing on terms satisfactory to the company 
the euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union  including the netherlands  established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies and the euro  leading to the adoption of the euro by these countries as their common legal currency 
the information systems of the company s european subsidiary  key technology bv  currently accommodates multiple currency transactions and has integrated euro denominated transactions with no difficulty 
key technology began implementing a conversion of its business systems to the euro concurrent with the start of the company s fiscal year 
the company expects to complete the conversion during its fiscal year  well before january  when the legacy currencies may no longer be legal tender 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has assessed its exposure to market risks for its financial instruments and has determined that its exposures to such risks are generally limited to those affected by the strength of the us dollar against the euro and the dutch guilder 
the terms of sales to european customers by key technology bv  the company s european subsidiary  are typically denominated in either euros  us dollars  dutch guilders or to a far lesser extent  the respective legacy currencies of its european customers 
the company expects that its standard terms of sales to international customers  other than those in europe  will continue to be denominated in us dollars 
for sales transactions between international customers  including european customers  and the company s domestic operations which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into a currency hedging transaction to minimize such risk 
at september   the company was not a party to any currency hedging transaction 
during the company s fiscal  the euro and the dutch guilder  the latter normally a stable currency  lost of their respective values against the us dollar 
the majority of this currency exchange movement occurred in the last six months of the company s fiscal year 
the effect of the stronger dollar on the operations and financial results of the company were o margins on automated inspection systems sold into europe were decreased approximately as the company continued a euro based pricing model to maintain market share against european manufacturers 
o translation adjustments of  net of income tax  were recognized as a component of comprehensive loss in the company s statement of shareholders equity as a result of converting the guilder denominated balance sheet of key technology into us dollars 
o foreign exchange losses of  were recognized in the other income and expense section of the consolidated income statement as a result of conversion of guilder and euro denominated receivables and cash carried on the balance sheet of the us operations 
among the factors influencing the strength of the us dollar on the world market were the general strength of the us economy  the relatively high interest rates in the us and continuing economic weakness in some economies of countries comprising the european union 
the company expects to continue to experience adverse effects from the relative strength of the us dollar on business outside of the united states  if factors supporting the strong us dollar do not reverse themselves to levels experienced in earlier years
