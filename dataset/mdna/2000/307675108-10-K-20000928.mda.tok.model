the volatile green coffee market presented us with opportunities to reduce our cost of raw materials for  as supplies of green coffee were abundant 
the green coffee market has been especially volatile since the brazilian frosts in perceived coffee shortages have  in the past  resulted in green coffee cost fluctuations of more than 
during fiscal  green coffee costs increased nearly in the first half of the year  decreasing to beginning of the year levels by the first of june during the month of june  green coffee costs increased over as the result of a weather threat to the brazilian coffee crop

coffee is an agricultural product that is produced in many nations around the world 
although it is consumed in those nations  the largest coffee consuming nation is the united states  followed by the nations of western europe 
green coffee is traded domestically on the coffee  sugar cocoa exchange csce in new york and is one of the largest and most volatile commodity markets 
the most important aspect of our operation is to secure a consistent supply of coffee 
some proportion of green coffee price fluctuations can be passed through to our customers  even if lagging the market changes  but maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keep inventory levels low and sufficient stock to meet customer needs 
we purchase our coffee through established coffee brokers  many of which are large international firms  to help minimize the risk of default on coffee deliveries 
we purchase much of our coffee on forward contracts for delivery as long as six months in the future 
sometimes these contracts are fixed price contracts  regardless of the change in price of green coffee between the contract and delivery dates 
at other times these contracts are variable price contracts  that allow the delivered price of contracted coffee to reflect the market price of coffee at the delivery date 
we occasionally use futures contracts to hedge exposure to coffee price fluctuations 
gains on hedging transactions are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the inventory 
losses on the hedging transactions are recognized in earnings currently and our green coffee inventory is adjusted currently through its lifo methodology 
futures contracts not designated as hedges  and terminations of contracts designed as hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
there were no open contracts at june  and accounting pronouncements derivatives and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the adoption of statement nos

we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates
