item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first defiance is a unitary thrift holding company which conducts business through its subsidiaries  first federal  the leader and first insurance 
first federal is a federally chartered savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest ohio where it operates full service branches  including a branch in fostoria ohio that opened in november first federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit  individual retirement accounts  real estate mortgage loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  home equity loans  and trust services 
the leader is a mortgage banking company that specializes in servicing loans originated under first time homebuyer programs 
under these programs  first time homebuyers are able to obtain loans at rates generally below market at the time of closing 
the funds for the loans are available as a result of bond issues through various state and local governmental units 
the leader  as master servicer under the bond programs  purchases the loans from the originator  principally other financial institutions or mortgage brokers 
once purchased by the leader  the loans under the specific bond programs are packaged and gnma securities are issued to the bond trustees under the programs 
as of december   the leader services approximately  loans with a total balance of billion including subservicing   loans with a balance of billion 
of these loans   are bond program loans with balances of billion 
because the loans under the first time homebuyer programs are issued at below market rates  they generally have significantly lower pre payments than conventional mortgage loans 
the leader also collects a significant amount of ancillary fees  including late charges and credit life insurance commissions 
first insurance sells a variety of property and casualty  group health and life insurance products and investment and annuity products 
because the first insurance acquisition occurred at the end of december  only the results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  are impacted by this transaction 
financial condition total assets at december  were million  an increase of from december  s total of million 
the july  acquisition of the leader has continued to significantly impact the statement of condition of first defiance 
as a result of increased production at the leader  loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights increased from million and million  respectively  as of december  to million and million  respectively  at december  in addition  loans held for sale which have been securitized in the normal course of the leader s operations have been included as trading securities in the investment portfolio 
these securities amounted to million as of december  and there were no such securities at december  additionally  the balance of the leader s customer s principal and interest payments along with tax and insurance escrow balances decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease resulted from a decrease in refinancing activities at the end of compared to  which results in lower balances held in the leader s customer s principal and interest escrow accounts 
leader s increased activity and the decrease in escrow balances were funded primarily through federal home loan bank fhlb debt  national certificates of deposit  and other bank borrowings 
fhlb debt grew million for the year  from million as of december  to million at december  brokered certificates of deposit increased from million at december  to million as of december  warehouse and term notes payable increased from  to million at december  and  respectively 
excluding the leader s operations  loans receivable increased million  from million at december  to million as of december  this increase was the result of increases in the commercial and home equity portfolios  partially offset by decreases in the mortgage and consumer portfolios 
commercial loans increased million  from million at december  to million as of december  home equity and improvement loans increased from million to million as of december  and  respectively 
mortgage loans decreased from million as of december  to million at december  additionally  consumer loans decreased million  from million to million as of december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company will continue to achieve increases in the commercial loan portfolio due to an increased emphasis on this type of lending 
the year over year decrease in the consumer portfolio was anticipated by the company as a result of stricter underwriting standards that were implemented as a result of credit quality issues noted in december of the decrease in the mortgage portfolio resulted from decreased mortgage loan production compared to regular pay downs of the existing portfolio and sales of all qualifying fixed rate production into the secondary market 
investment securities  which include available for sale  trading  and held to maturity securities  increased by million to million from million 
as discussed above  the increase was primarily the result of the addition of million in trading securities related to the securitization of certain available for sale mortgage loans 
first defiance had growth in deposits for the year of million  to million at december  from million at december  the most significant growth was in certificates of deposit  which increased from million at december  to million at december  the majority of the growth in certificates of deposits resulted from the growth in national or brokered certificates 
in addition  money market demand accounts increased to million at december  from million at december  savings and checking accounts decreased from million and million  respectively  at december  to million and million  respectively  at december  average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

net income for was negatively impacted by a million pre tax million after tax and 
on a diluted per share basis fourth quarter adjustment to the reserve for loan losses 
see discussion on provision for loan losses 
on a diluted per share basis  first defiance s net income was   and 
for the years ended december   and respectively 
earnings per share have been favorably impacted in both and by a reduction in average shares outstanding as a result of a number of share repurchase programs 
on a diluted basis  the average shares outstanding have declined from million in to million in and million in since january  a total of million shares have been repurchased under stock repurchase programs  including  in net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
net interest margin was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest margin in is primarily a result of the financing required to support the million increase in average non interest earning assets from million in to million in the increase in average non interest earning assets was the result of increases in the average balances in mortgage servicing rights  goodwill  and prepaid expenses and other assets 
mortgage servicing rights increased from an average of million for to million for  while goodwill increased from an average of million in to million in these average non earning assets increased due to the fact that only six months of the leader s operations were included in the average balance for and total secondary market activity increased dramatically in the decrease in the net interest margin in compared to resulted from similar downward pressures corresponding to the increase in average non interest earning assets from million for to million for the yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   a decrease from the years ended december  and when the yields on interest earning assets were and  respectively 
the decline in yields between and and the yields between and is primarily due to the addition of the leader s mortgage loans available for sale during the second half of and the subsequent increases in the average balance on these loans 
those loans  which had an average balance of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  are generally originated under first time homebuyer programs and carried an average interest rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s cost of funds decreased to for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the decline in yield on average earning assets outpacing the decline in cost of funds  the interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for and for the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for and million for the addition of the leader significantly impacts the comparability of both non interest income and non interest expense because of the revenues and costs associated with the mortgage banking operation are included for only the last six months of for the year ended december  non interest income was million compared to million for and only million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for income for the leader for the twelve months ended december  and the six months ended december  included in first defiance s results was million and million  respectively 
the net earnings of first defiance after factoring in the after tax cost of funding the acquisition were increased by million and  or 
and 
per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie  the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for when compared to the yield on those loans declined to in versus in the increase in loans receivable was primarily attributable to the growth in the average balance of the leader s loans held for sale 
the average balance of these loans grew from million for to million for the increase of those loans also caused the reduced yield because of the below market nature of loans originated under the first time homebuyer programs 
interest income was favorably impacted by the increase in the average balance in commercial loans  which was million for compared to million for the increase in commercial loan balances occurred after the hiring of three experienced commercial lenders and a commercial credit analyst during the second half of the increases in loans held for sale and commercial loans were partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance on mortgage loans and a million decrease in the average balance on all consumer loans 
as discussed above  mortgage loan production for was lower than due to the significant amount of refinance activity in the prior year 
the decrease in the average balance on consumer loans was anticipated as underwriting standards were strengthened in response to credit qualify problems in this portfolio noted in see the discussion of the provision for loan loss 
in  total interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for when compared to the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the leader s loans available for sale  which averaged million for the last six months of  and an increase in the average balance of the commercial loan portfolio  which increased from million to million as a result of the hiring of three experienced commercial lenders in the second half of the yield on those loans declined to in versus in because of the low coupons on the leader s available for sale portfolio 
interest earnings from the investment portfolio and other interest bearing deposits declined to million in compared to million in and million in the decline in was due to a decrease in the average balance of securities and other interest bearing deposits from million in to million in the decline was primarily due to maturities and calls of securities during being used as a funding source for the growth in the loan portfolio 
the yield on the average portfolio balance in was 
in  the portfolio had a yield of on an average balance of million while in the investment portfolio had a yield of on an average balance of million 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in compared to million for this increase is due to the increase in the average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was the result of increased funding requirements relating to the loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights at the leader  net of the increase in average escrow deposits which are included in non interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in from the time that first defiance acquired the leader in june until december  the leader utilized a consortium of banks to provide its funding needs for both warehoused mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights 
in december  the bank debts were paid off by first defiance and replaced with less costly internal sources of funding  primarily fhlb advances and brokered certificates of deposit 
as a result  the average balance of fhlb advances in increased by million to million from million in first defiance took advantage of lower interest rates during the later part of and the first several months of and fixed a portion the advances for one  two and five years 
overall  the rate paid on fhlb advances was in compared to in the increase in fhlb advances replaced debt to outside banks  which had an average balance of million in compared to million in the average cost paid on those outside borrowings in was a net including a credit received from the banks for borrowers escrow funds deposited in those financial institutions 
that credit  which was at a federal funds rate  totaled million in excluding the credit for escrow balances  the cost of bank financing in was 
as noted above  for  the borrowers escrow funds have been placed on deposit with first federal as a source of no cost funds 
the cost of the million average bank financing in was 
first defiance retains warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions totaling million as of december  to supplement its other funding sources 
in  interest expense increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the large increase is primarily due to the financing requirements of the leader s operations 
the average bank debt outstanding for the six months that the leader was included in first defiance s results in was approximately million or million average balance for the year 
the net cost of those funds was approximately  net of the credit that the leader was receiving for escrow funds on deposit at the banks fed funds rates 
beginning in november  those escrow balances were placed on deposit with first federal 
interest expense in also increased because of an increase in the average balance of deposits outstanding  which increased to million in compared to million in the average cost of those deposits declined by basis points in  to from in the average balance of fhlb advances increased to million in from million in the average cost of those advances declined to from 
the balance in fhlb advances increased substantially in december  as they were used as the primary source of funding to replace the leader s bank debt 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin for the year ended december  declined to from for and for the decline was due to the financing of the leader  particularly the financing of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill  which are both non interest earning assets 
the balance of mortgage servicing rights at december  was million and the balance of goodwill at that date was million 
provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that is deemed appropriate by management 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  industry standards  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of first defiance s loan portfolio 
in  four factors combined to require the large increase in the loan loss provision an increase in charge offs and delinquencies within first federal s consumer loan portfolio  rapid growth in first federal s commercial loan portfolio  the status of first federal s mobile home loan portfolio  and the acquisition of the leader mortgage company 
the consolidated allowance for loan losses at december  was million  compared to million at december and million at december  during first federal experienced increased levels of charge offs of loans in its consumer loan portfolio  which is comprised primarily of automobile loans 
in response to the level of charge offs and internal and external reviews of this portfolio  management increased the allowance for consumer loans by approximately million 
subsequent to that review  consumer loan underwriting and approval  which were previously performed through first federal s branch network  were centralized at the main office under experienced underwriters with revised lending authority 
the total outstanding balance of consumer loans originated in and the period identified in the internal and external reviews to have the underwriting deficiencies were million as of december  and declined to million at december  the reserve against this portfolio was million or of the outstanding balance at december  and million or of the outstanding balance at december  total consumer loans outstanding and the corresponding reserves were million and million at december  and million and million at december  the growth in the commercial loan portfolio also has resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
during  when the balance of commercial loans increased from million to million  the related allowance for loan losses increased by  commercial loans have continued to experience significant growth in as the portfolio has grown to million as of december  the related allowance for loan losses for commercial loans grew  to million at december  during  first federal reserved against the remaining mobile home loan balances not already classified as doubtful or loss 
this adjustment resulted in increasing the mobile home loan loss allowance to million at december  in may of  first federal sold the remaining mobile home portfolio  which had a net book value after deducting the related reserve of million  for million 
during the last six months of  there also was a  increase in the provision for loan losses as a result of the acquisition of the leader 
most of the loans that are originated or acquired by the leader have fha or va guarantees 
as a result  the risk of loss on those loans is limited to the legal costs associated with foreclosure on the loan  which has averaged approximately  per loan in foreclosure 
this is a cost that the leader incurs whether the loan is included in its own portfolio or serviced for others 
it has been the leader s general practice to repurchase loans which have a note rate of or greater that are in foreclosure out of the gnma pool in order to avoid having to advance principal and interest payments to the investors for those loans  as is required under their agreements with gnma 
the leader reserves for the foreclosure losses when the loan goes to foreclosure  whether the loan is purchased from the gnma pool or not 
management also records an estimated loss reserve to provide for potential losses as loans become delinquent based on the leader s historical loss experience on similar loans 
a provision related to those loans totaling million was recorded by the leader in the increase in provision expense for the leader in compared to was the result of increased foreclosure proceedings along with increases in the general reserve resulting from the increase in total number of loans serviced by the leader from  loans as of december  to  loans at december  total non performing loans were million  or 
of total loans  as of december   compared with million  or 
of total loans  as of december   and million  or 
of total loans  as of december  total charge offs were million  million  and million for the periods ended december    and  respectively 
over the same periods  recoveries amounted to   and  respectively 
non interest income in acquiring the leader  first defiance exchanged net interest income for a large increase in non interest income  primarily loan servicing fees and gains on sale of mortgage loans 
total non interest income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non interest income for the year ended december  was only million 
for the year ended  the leader recognized million in loan servicing fees compared to million for the six months included in first defiance s year ended december  total gains on sale of mortgage loans at the leader increased from million for the six months of to million for primarily due to increased loan production and sales 
the leader also realized a one time gain on the sale of non core mortgage servicing rights totaling  in excluding the leader s results  non interest income was million in  million in  and million in total gains on sale of loans excluding the leader were  in  compared to million in and only  for the gains on sale included a  gain in the third quarter of from the sale of million of seasoned mortgage loans 
in  first federal also realized a  gain from its sale of a large portion of its mobile home loan portfolio 
additionally  dividends on fhlb stock increased to  in compared to  in and  in the increase in these dividends was the result of purchasing more stock throughout and to support the additional borrowings at the fhlb 
the results also include the revenue associated first insurance 
total revenues for first insurance for were million 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as with non interest income  the addition of the leader in july significantly increased the consolidated level of non interest expense 
for the six months from july to december   the leader s total non interest expense was million compared to million for the year ended december  included in the total are million in compensation and benefits million in  million in occupancy costs  in  million in amortization of mortgage servicing rights million in and million in amortization of goodwill and other acquisition costs  including non compete and employment agreements million in 
excluding the leader  non interest expense for first defiance for was million compared to million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to compensation and benefit expense that increased by million over of this increase  million related to compensation and benefits for first insurance and million related to increases in compensation and benefits at first federal 
the first federal increase was due to a number of factors including increases in staffing levels resulting from branch and product line ie  commercial lending and trust services expansion  the payment of incentive bonuses to salaried employees  the payment of a discretionary contribution to the company s k plan  increases in the cost of the company s group medical plan  and decreases in the amount of payroll costs deferred because of a reduction in mortgage loan production 
the payment of incentive bonuses and discretionary k contributions represented a partial payment of pools established at the beginning of certain targets were established for earnings per share  revenue growth and efficiencies 
the achievement of a portion of those objectives resulted in a partial payment of the bonus and k pools 
no bonus or discretionary k payments were made in  the first year of the incentive based compensation programs 
in addition to compensation expense  occupancy costs increased  in resulting from the expansion of the branch network into findlay and fostoria  depreciation on the company s expanded wide area network  and occupancy costs related to first insurance 
data processing costs increased by  in resulting from upgrading systems with the company s third party provider  yk related expenditures  and the expansion of the branch network 
amortization of goodwill increased by  as a result of the first insurance acquisition 
additionally  other non interest expenses increased  as a result of the first insurance acquisition  the expansion of the company s branch and atm networks  costs associated with attracting national certificates of deposit  and increases in the examination fees charged by the regulators 
these increases in non interest expenses were partially mitigated by a  reduction in state franchise tax due to tax planning strategies and a  reduction in loan servicing due to the sale of the majority of the mobile home portfolio in non interest expense for first defiance for  excluding the impact of the leader would have increased by  over occupancy expense increased by  due to the addition of the hicksville and paulding branches and a full year of depreciation expense on major renovations completed in early to mid data processing costs increased by  due to the enhancement of certain systems 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased by  due to an increase in loans serviced for others at first federal 
also  state franchise tax increased by  those increases were partially offset by a  decline in compensation  which decreased due to a reduction in esop expense  the termination of first federal s defined benefit pension plan  and a reduction in year end bonuses  including the elimination of year end bonuses for most of first defiance s salaried personnel because of operating results 
also  the discretionary contribution to the company s k plan was not made because the board of directors determined that the operating results did not warrant such a contribution 
those adjustments more than offset increased compensation related to staffing increases  including a full year with branches in paulding and hicksville  the expansion of the commercial loan department beginning in mid  and the hiring of trust department personnel between july and october 
income taxes income tax amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates for the three years were   and respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is the result of the increase in non taxable interest income and a reduction of income at the holding company level that is subject to state income tax 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is the result of the addition of non deductible goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash earnings the selected financial data presented in the following table highlights the performance of first defiance on a cash basis for each of the three years in the period ended december  the data has been adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill and the related tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill 
this goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of the leader  and the insurance agencies which were combined to form first insurance and investments which were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the amortization of goodwill does not result in a cash expense and has essentially no economic impact on liquidity and funds management activity 
cash basis financial data provide an additional basis for measuring a company s ability to support future growth  pay dividends  and repurchase shares 
the cash basis data presented in the table below has not been adjusted to exclude the impact of other non cash items such as depreciation  the provision for loan losses  and amortization of mrp and esop expense

the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
credit risk is increased by lending or investing activities that concentrate a financial institution s assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of related occurrences 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower  and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
liquidity and capital resources first federal is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of united states treasury  agency and other investments having maturities of five years or less 
current ots regulations require that a savings institutions maintain liquid assets not less than of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
first federal s liquidity exceeded applicable requirements at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by operations was million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash was generated by first defiance s operating activities during the years ended december  and  primarily as a result of net income 
in  the company used more cash in operating activities than were provided because of net growth in the held for sale loan portfolio which was funded through financing activities 
the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  goodwill amortization  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop  the origination of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operations and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payments on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of securities 
in cash provided from the sale and maturity of investment securities totaled million  while million in additional securities were purchased 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits and advance payments from loan servicing customers  the utilization of fhlb advances  and borrowings from other bank sources 
for the year ended december   fhlb advances increased by million  warehouse and term notes payable increased by million  and national certificates of deposit increased by million 
for additional information about cash flows from first defiance s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   first defiance had an aggregate of million in unfunded commitments to originate loans including unused portions of lines of credit and letters of credit and no commitments to purchase securities 
at the same date  first defiance had commitments to sell million of loans held for sale 
at that date first defiance had commitments to acquire million of mortgage loans under first time home buyer programs  all of which have offsetting commitments for sale into the secondary market as gnma or fnma mortgage backed securities 
also as of december   the total amount of certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature by december  was million 
first defiance believes that it has adequate resources to fund commitments as they arise 
it can adjust the rate on savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage or non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances 
because the fhlb requires that the collateral must exceed of the outstanding advance balance  first defiance may also from time to time be required to utilize other sources of financing  including brokered certificates of deposit and bank advances 
at december  first defiance has million of lines available from other financial institutions  of which million is being utilized 
stockholders equity decreased by million  or at december  compared to december  due to the repurchase of  shares of first defiance stock of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year 
the shares in were repurchased at an average cost of per share and  as a result  stockholders equity was reduced by million 
first defiance made similar purchases of million shares of common stock during additionally  shareholders equity was reduced by million as a result of a decrease in the market value of available for sale securities 
the equity reduction  caused by the factors discussed above  was offset to a lesser degree by earnings retention  the vesting or issuance of shares under the company s management recognition plan mrp and employee stock ownership plan esop  and the issuance of stock under stock option programs 
net income for was million  of which million was returned to shareholders in the form of declared dividends 
per share 
the vesting of mrp shares and release of esop shares increased equity by  and  respectively 
stock option exercises increased equity by approximately  the book value of first defiance s common stock was at december   compared to at december  the tangible book value excluding goodwill of those shares was and at december  and first federal is subject to various capital requirements of the office of thrift supervision 
at december   first federal had capital ratios that exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements 
see item business regulation regulatory capital requirements in this report 
year during  the company prepared for potential computer system and other problems related to the year date change 
the process involved the identification and remediation of date recognition problems in computer systems  software and other operating equipment 
it also included working with third party vendors  developing and testing contingency plans  and planning for potential liquidity needs associated with potential large cash withdrawals 
to date  no year failures have been noted in any of the company s systems 
although considered unlikely  unanticipated problems in first defiance s core business processes or systems  including problems with non compliant third parties and general disruptions to the economy could still occur despite efforts to remediate such problems and the related contingency planning 
management will continue to monitor all processes throughout to address any issues as they arise and ensure that all systems continue to function appropriately 
because its data processing functions are outsourced  the cost of year remediation was not material to first federal 
first federal s third party processor assessed a fee of less than  to cover the cost of the test bank established to provide for the appropriate testing 
testing itself was performed by individuals responsible for the various applications and was coordinated by the vice president of operations 
the cost of the individuals was not quantified  however the three primary individuals involved devoted approximately of their time during the testing phase which was essentially completed during the first quarter 
first federal s total out of pocket expenses recognized in conjunction with year compliance were less than  in the estimated total cost of year compliance by the leader was approximately  including the cost of hardware and software upgrades  programming costs  and retention bonuses to key staff members involved in the year project 
the portion of the costs associated with hardware acquisitions was capitalized while internal programming costs and retention payments were expensed 
the retention bonuses will be paid to certain employees who are still employed on june  year expense for the leader for was less than  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  using projected amounts as a base case  first defiance s net interest income would decrease by 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would increase by 
the acquisition of the leader mortgage company provided first defiance with a significant source of non interest income 
the mortgage banking operations also serve as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising rate environment because increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the mortgage servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments on the underlying loans 
however  because the leader s portfolio is comprised primarily of below market rate loans  the prepayments on the loans it serviced have been much lower than industry averages 
the leader averaged prepayments for the year ended december  which is lower than the prepayment speeds for the mortgage industry as a whole  and lower than the experience for the year ended december  the simulation model used by first defiance measures the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income only 
the company also monitors the potential change in the value of its mortgage servicing portfolio given the same basis point shift in interest rates 
at december   a basis point decrease in interest rates would require first defiance to establish a reserve for impairment of mortgage servicing rights of less than  first defiance  through the leader  has significantly increased its origination capabilities  on both a retail and wholesale basis 
loan production at the leader was billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the six months ended december  mortgage servicing rights increased from million as of december  to million as of december  to protect themselves from the risk of changing interest rates  mortgage banking companies frequently use off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge the exposure of the mortgage loan pipeline 
the leader does not need to hedge its mortgage loan pipeline because the trustees under the various first time homebuyer programs are required to fund the issuance of the gnma securities backed by the mortgages in the leader s pipeline at a guaranteed price 
first defiance also has increased its lending activities in the commercial loan area 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s commercial portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans is generally less than seven years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans million at december  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal has been selling fixed rate mortgage loans with a maturity of years or greater in the secondary market 
historically  loans with maturities less than years have been retained in portfolio although first federal began selling a portion of its year fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market beginning in january for the year ended december   first federal sold million of loans in the secondary market 
at december  first federal s servicing portfolio totaled million  compared to million at december  in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also utilizes the market value of net portfolio equity npv methodology adopted by the ots 
under the npv methodology  interest rate risk exposure irr is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in first federal s net interest income nii and npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates simultaneously rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of nii and npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented in the following table  as of december   is an analysis of first federal s which for this purpose also includes the leader estimated interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates up and down basis points in point increments 
assumptions used in calculating the amounts in this table are generally those assumptions utilized by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of the thrifts it regulates 
however  because first defiance utilizes a model that evaluates the market value of mortgage servicing rights on a loan by loan basis  management believes that the results generated by that model are more accurate than the generic ots assumptions 
for purposes of this table  management s valuation of mortgage servicing rights have been substituted for ots results 
npv is calculated by the ots for the purposes of interest rate risk assessment and should not be considered as an indicator of value of first federal 
december  net portfolio value as of net portfolio value present value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp in the event of a basis point change in interest rates based upon estimates as of december   first federal would experience an decrease in npv in a declining rate environment and a decrease in npv in a rising rate environment 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
mortgage servicing rights act as a natural hedge to these changes in value of other monetary assets as msrs generally rise in value in a rising rate environment and decline in value in a falling rate environment because of the prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the npv methodology  the decline in npv in a rising rate environment is because first federal has used fhlb advances and deposits with shorter terms than the assets in which it invests 
the decline in npv in a falling rate environment is because of the reduction in value in mortgage servicing rights 
the analysis indicated that increases or decreases in monetary assets and increases or decreases in mortgage servicing rights generally offset each other in both rising and falling rate environments 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
