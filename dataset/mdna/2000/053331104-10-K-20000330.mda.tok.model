overview autoweb 
com is a leading consumer automotive internet service 
our web site centralizes an extensive collection of automotive related commerce  content and community offerings to assist consumers in researching  evaluating and buying vehicles and automotive related products and services such as insurance and financing 
in addition  we provide automotive content  web hosting and development services and sales automation services to vehicle manufacturers  dealers and online partners 
also  for consumers and automotive professionals  through our acquisition of aic  we provide autosite 
com  a  page online vehicle buyer s guide and rich suite of related services and information  and original automotive editorial content 
we began selling our services to automobile dealers and launched the autoweb 
com web site for consumer use in october since that time  we have increased our network to over  member dealers where each franchise and pre owned location for a particular vehicle manufacturer is defined as a member dealer 
we originally charged our member dealers based on a subscription model  where each member dealer paid a flat monthly fee in exchange for our directing consumer purchase inquiries to them 
because the number of purchase inquiries directed to member dealers varied widely  due to factors such as their location and franchise type  the cost per purchase inquiry under this model differed substantially from member dealer to member dealer 
in february  we changed our pricing model and began selling our services to new dealers using a pay for performance model 
under this arrangement  a member dealer pays us a fee only for a qualified purchase inquiry that it actually receives 
we believe our pay for performance model enables our member dealers to maximize their return from  and enhances their satisfaction with  our services 
in february  we also began converting our existing member dealer subscription contracts to contracts utilizing the pay for performance model 
as of december   approximately of our member dealer contracts still utilize the subscription model 
we derive the majority of our revenues from fees charged to our member dealers in exchange for qualified purchase inquiries and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
the revenue related to each fee is recognized in the month the qualified purchase inquiry is provided to the member dealer 
we maintain a returns reserve against purchase inquiries that are later deemed not to have been qualified 
in december  we began providing online advertising space on the autoweb 
com site and recognizing revenues from fees paid by these advertisers 
revenues from advertising contracts  which typically have terms of less than three months  are recognized as the contracts are fulfilled 
in february  we began offering automotive related services on the autoweb 
com site through agreements with third party category partners 
we derive revenues whereby a third party pays us for the right to provide its consumer services  such as automobile financing and insurance  on our web site 
revenues from these agreements are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements 
we incurred net losses of million  million  including million of stock based compensation  and million  including million of stock based compensation in  and  respectively 
we intend to increase our focus and spending on brand development  marketing and promotion  site content development  strategic relationships and technology and operating infrastructure development 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
although our net revenues have grown in recent quarters  we cannot be certain that net revenues will increase at a rate sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we were to achieve profitability in any period  we might fail to sustain or increase that profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
on july   the company acquired technology and other assets from salesenhancer 
com se for approximately million in cash 
on october   the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of aic  a division of the gale group  inc for  shares of common stock valued at million and million in cash 
we believe that these acquisitions are critical to our core business because aic supplies content to our internet site and se enables our member automotive dealers to effectively manage the referrals provided by autoweb 
com 
results of operations net revenues our net revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in approximately of the increase in net revenues from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to higher levels of net dealer fee revenues 
revenues derived from advertisers accounted for the majority of the remaining increase in net revenues for these periods 
dealer fee revenues increased as a result of increases in the size of our member dealer network and the number of purchase inquiries that we provided to our member dealers 
as described above  we began to change our pricing model in february from a subscription based model to a pay for performance model 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues increased from  in to  in and to million in approximately of the increase in cost of net revenues from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in the costs of web site operations  including personnel  equipment  depreciation and occupancy costs 
approximately of the increase in cost of net revenues from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in the cost of providing site content information  such as kelley blue book data 
approximately of the increase in the cost of net revenues from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in our revenue sharing expenses  related to the operation of our co branded sites  which began contributing an increasing number of consumer purchase inquiries 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in approximately of the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases primarily in online advertising and  to a lesser extent  our spending on public relations  advertising in the traditional media  trade shows and other promotions 
approximately of the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in personnel costs caused by significant increases in headcount  primarily salespersons focused on enrolling member dealers 
product development our product development expenses increased from  in to  in and to million in these expenses increased primarily as a result of increased hiring of product development personnel and  to a lesser extent  as a result of increased occupancy costs 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased from  in to million in and to million in approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in personnel costs resulting from increased hiring of administrative personnel  including most of our current officers 
approximately of the increase from to and approximately of the increase from to were due to increases in information technology support related to administrative functions and occupancy costs 
the remainder of the increase from to and from to was due to increases in professional consulting fees 
stock based compensation we incurred no stock based compensation expense in we recorded a total of million of unearned stock based compensation in  of which million was amortized in  primarily in the fourth quarter 
we recorded a total of million of unearned stock based compensation and amortization expense totaling million in interest and other income expense  net in  interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances derived primarily from the net proceeds from our sale of series b preferred stock in june exceeded interest expense on borrowings 
interest and other income expense  net  in represents interest expense on borrowings under capital leases and our credit facilities  partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
in  interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  primarily derived from the net proceeds from our initial public offering  exceeded interest expense on borrowings 
income taxes we recorded net losses of million and million and million in  and  respectively 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was recorded in any of these years 
the resulting deferred tax asset  representing primarily such net operating loss carryforwards  has been reduced in full by a valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources prior to march  we financed our operations primarily from sales of preferred stock and  in to a significantly lesser extent  borrowing under a long term debt facility 
in march  we raised million net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other offering costs and expenses in our initial public offering 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in  primarily as a result of our net loss 
in  our million net loss was partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
in  our million net loss before stock based compensation expense was partially offset by an increase of million in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
in  our net loss of million before stock based compensation expense was partially offset by an increase of million in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was  in  million in and million in this increase from to was primarily due to the acquisition of certain software products and other intangible and tangible assets of salesenhancer 
com  inc and aic and the purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  net cash provided by financing activities was almost entirely the result of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock net of repurchases and  to a lesser extent  the result of proceeds from borrowings under a long term credit facility 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock at our initial public offering 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  as of that date  we had total minimum lease obligations of million under certain non cancelable operating leases 
depending on our rate of growth and cash requirements  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital or capital expenditure needs 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or  if available  that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to us 
in march  we raised million net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses in our initial public offering 
at december   the total of our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments were million 
we believe that our current cash position together with anticipated future revenues will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
factors that may affect future results we are an early stage company we were incorporated in october therefore  we have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and prospects 
moreover  our business model is evolving and depends on our ability to generate revenues from multiple sources through our web site 
before investing  you should evaluate the risks  expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies such as ours that are in the early stages of development and that are entering new and rapidly changing markets like the internet 
in particular  to address these risks we face the following challenges 
maintaining and increasing our consumer base  
maintaining and increasing our network of member dealers  
managing the quality of services delivered by member dealers  vehicle manufacturers and category partners  
generating continuing revenues through our web site from consumers  member dealers and category partners  
competing effectively with existing and potential competitors  
developing further our unproven business model  
developing further autoweb 
com awareness and brand loyalty  
anticipating and adapting to the evolving e commerce market  
continuing to develop our technology infrastructure to handle greater internet traffic efficiently  
managing expanding operations  
broadening our service offerings and attracting and retaining additional category partners and content providers to enable us to expand our service offerings  and 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we may not successfully implement any of our strategies or successfully address these risks and uncertainties 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly our results of operations have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this form k our revenue growth rates may not be sustainable 
any shortfall in our revenues would immediately increase our operating losses and would adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect to be substantially dependent on member dealer fees 
therefore  our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to be particularly affected by the level of member dealer fees in each quarter 
we plan to increase our operating expenses significantly  based on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to such a shortfall 
this will adversely affect our operating results 
we believe that we may experience seasonality in our business 
the seasonal patterns of internet usage and vehicle purchasing do not completely overlap 
internet usage typically declines during the summer and certain holiday periods  while vehicle purchasing in the united states is strongest in the late spring and summer months 
because of our limited operating history  we do not know which seasonal pattern  if any  will dominate 
due to the foregoing factors and factors described elsewhere in this form k  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that our results of operations in some future quarter may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
we have a history of net losses and expect net losses for the foreseeable future we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception  including a net loss of million in we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the size of future net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth in our revenues from member dealer fees  category partners fees  advertising sales and other e commerce activities 
it is critical to our success that we continue to expend financial and management resources to develop autoweb 
com brand awareness and loyalty through marketing and promotion  expansion of our member dealer network  development of our online content and expansion of our other services 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly during the next several years  especially in sales and marketing 
with increased expenses  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
as a result  we may never achieve or sustain profitability  and  if we do achieve profitability in any period  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a new and unproven business model the manner in which we conduct our business and charge for our services is new and unproven 
the model depends upon our ability to generate revenue streams from multiple sources through our web site  including 
fees paid by member dealers for consumer referrals  
fees paid by companies in industries related to vehicles such as insurance and financing  
advertising fees paid by vehicle manufacturers and other companies that want access to vehicle purchasers  
fees paid by vehicle manufacturers  dealers and online companies that want access to automotive content  and 
fees paid by individuals who want to advertise their vehicles for sale 
in order for us to be successful  we must have consumers visit our web site regularly to increase the likelihood that they will use our service when they are interested in buying a vehicle or a related product or service 
therefore  we must not only develop services that directly generate revenue  but also provide information and community offerings that attract consumers to our web site frequently 
we will need to develop new offerings in each of these areas as consumer preferences change and new competitors emerge 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to provide consumers with an acceptable blend of services  information and community offerings 
we provide information and community offerings without charge  and we may not be able to generate sufficient service revenues to pay for these offerings 
accordingly  we are not sure our business model will be successful or that we can sustain revenue growth or be profitable 
the online market for automotive services is new and rapidly developing 
as is typical for any new  rapidly evolving market  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk 
for example  in we changed our pricing model from a fixed rate  subscription based pricing model to a pay for performance pricing model under which each member dealer pays a fee for each qualified purchase inquiry that we deliver to it from a pre selected geographic radius 
in  we also increased our pricing levels 
these changes may not prove to be successful 
it is also difficult to predict the market s future growth rate  if any 
because of the low barriers to entry  the market is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or our services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is dependent on the economic strength of the automotive industry the economic strength of the automotive industry significantly impacts the revenues we derive from our member dealers  vehicle manufacturers and category partners  advertising revenues and consumer traffic to our web site 
the automotive industry is cyclical  with vehicle sales fluctuating due to changes in national and global economic forces 
since our incorporation  vehicle sales in the united states have been at historically high levels 
we cannot assure you that vehicle sales will stay at their current levels  and a decrease in the current level of vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely heavily on member dealers we derive the majority of our revenues from member dealer fees payments from member dealers for each purchase inquiry that we provide to them  and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
member dealer fees represented approximately   and of our net revenues in   and  respectively 
consequently  our business is highly dependent on consumers use of autoweb 
com to purchase vehicles so that member dealers will achieve a satisfactory return on their investment in the autoweb 
com program 
the success of our business strategy depends on our member dealers adherence to the autoweb 
com purchase process  including responding to consumer purchase inquiries within hours  providing a competitive  firm quote to consumers during the initial communication  explaining the autoweb 
com purchase process to the consumer and answering any consumer questions 
we devote significant efforts and resources to certifying and supporting participating member dealers in these practices that are intended to increase consumer satisfaction 
our inability to certify and support member dealers effectively  or member dealers failure to adopt such practices  respond rapidly and professionally to vehicle purchase inquiries  or sell vehicles in accordance with our marketing strategies  could result in low consumer satisfaction and materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we must reduce our high member dealer turnover to maintain and increase our network of member dealers  we must reduce the rate of turnover of our member dealers 
commencing in february  we introduced a new pay for performance pricing model and began actively to convert our existing member dealers to this model 
prior to that time  all of our member dealers were on a subscription model under which they paid a fixed amount per month regardless of the number of purchase inquiries that we provided to them 
during  we lost approximately of the member dealers that we had at the beginning of the year and converted approximately to the new pricing model 
during  we lost approximately of the performance based member dealers that we converted or with which we first entered into a contract in during  we lost approximately of the performance based member dealers that we had at the beginning of the year or first entered into a contract during the year 
attrition remains unacceptably high 
we believe that we can reduce our attrition rate over time as our member dealer network stabilizes due to the efforts of our dealer development and support group and due to reduced conversion activity 
we are undertaking several initiatives to reduce our attrition 
these initiatives include the recent purchase of customer relationship management software  the sale of proprietary internet lead management software to our member dealers and an increase in dealer training 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce the level of this attrition  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we need to build strong brand loyalty we believe that establishing and maintaining our brand loyalty is critical to attract consumers  member dealers  vehicle manufacturers  category partners and advertisers 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will increase as low barriers to entry encourage the proliferation of web sites 
in order to attract and retain consumers  member dealers  advertisers and category partners  and in response to competitive pressures  we intend to increase spending substantially to create and maintain brand loyalty among these groups 
we plan to accomplish this by expanding our current online advertising campaigns and by conducting advertising campaigns in traditional forms of media  such as newspaper  radio and television 
we believe that advertising rates  and the cost of our online advertising campaigns in particular  could increase substantially in the future 
if our branding efforts are not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
promotion and enhancement of the autoweb 
com brand will also depend  in part  on our success in consistently providing a high quality consumer experience for purchasing vehicles and related products  relevant and useful information and a quality community experience 
if consumers  other internet users  member dealers  vehicle manufacturers  category partners and advertisers do not perceive the autoweb 
com service offerings to be of high quality  or if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by such groups  the value of our brand could be impaired or diluted 
such brand impairment or dilution could decrease the attractiveness of autoweb 
com to one or more of these groups  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on third party relationships we have entered into agreements with various category partners  some of which require us to feature them exclusively in certain sections of our web site 
for example  we have entered into an agreement with intuit s quicken insuremarket quicken  pursuant to which quicken has the exclusive right to offer insurance services on our web site through october  existing and future exclusive arrangements may prevent us from entering into other content agreements  advertising or sponsorship arrangements or other commercial relationships 
many companies that we may pursue for a commercial relationship may also offer competing services 
as a result  these competitors may be reluctant to enter into commercial relationships with us 
our business could be adversely affected if we do not maintain our existing commercial relationships on terms as favorable as currently in effect  if we do not establish additional commercial relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if our commercial relationships do not result in the expected increased use of our web site 
additionally  our sale of automotive content  web hosting and development services and sales automation services to vehicle manufacturers and online partners is dependent upon a few primary relationships  including competitive online automotive car buying services and various vehicle manufacturers 
we also depend on establishing and maintaining a number of commercial relationships with high traffic web sites to increase traffic on autoweb 
com 
we currently have agreements with america online and its related properties  yahoo and hotbot 
there is intense competition for placements on these sites  and in the future we may not be able to enter into distribution relationships on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if we enter into distribution relationships with these web sites  they themselves may not attract significant numbers of consumers 
therefore  our web site may receive less than the number of additional consumers we expect from these relationships 
moreover  we may have to pay significant fees to establish or renew these relationships 
we also depend on establishing and maintaining a number of commercial relationships with other companies 
our current relationships include 
new car test drive and ase  under which we purchase content for use by our consumers  
america online s digital city  iwon 
com and citibank  under which we share the revenue generated from automotive and related purchase inquiries submitted by consumers and directed to our web site through links between our web site and the other company s web site  and 
members of the autoweb 
com affiliates program  each of which receives a commission from us for each new or pre owned vehicle purchase inquiry or classified ad delivered to us through a link to the affiliate s web site 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish new agreements or maintain existing agreements or that the above agreements can be renewed on commercially acceptable terms 
we also may not be able to maintain relationships with third parties that supply us with software or products that are crucial to our success  and the vendors of these software or products may not be able to sustain any third party claims or rights against their use 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the software  services or products of those companies that provide access or links to our services or products will achieve market acceptance or commercial success 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our existing relationships will result in sustained business arrangements  successful service or product offerings or the generation of significant revenues for us 
failure of one or more of our relationships to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success or the termination of one or more relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we need to continue to develop autoweb 
com content and service offerings to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the ease of use  responsiveness  functionality and features of the autoweb 
com site and develop new services in addition to continuing to improve the consumer purchasing experience 
these efforts may require the development or licensing of increasingly complex technologies 
we may not be successful in developing or introducing new features  functions and services  and these features  functions and services may not achieve market acceptance or enhance our brand loyalty 
if we fail to develop and introduce new features  functions or services effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we need to manage our growth our recent growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
in august  dean debiase  our chief executive officer and director since joining the company in december was promoted to chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
in november we had several management changes 
samuel hedgpeth  our chief financial officer since joining the company in september was promoted to president and chief operating officer  thomas stone  who joined the company in january  was promoted from vice president  finance to chief financial officer and james wolfe  our director of marketing since joining the company in august was promoted to vice president  marketing 
since august  there were also resignations by cary rosenzweig  vice president  marketing and garrett mullins  vice president  dealers sales and member services 
any inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on certain key personnel our future success is substantially dependent on our senior management and key technical personnel 
if one or more of our key employees decided to leave us  join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to retain and attract highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
as of december   we had full time employees  and we anticipate that the number of employees will increase significantly during the next months 
wages for managerial and technical employees are increasing and are expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future due to the competitive nature of the current employment market  particularly in northern california 
we may be unable to retain key technical and managerial personnel or to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
we have experienced difficulty from time to time attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business  and we may experience similar difficulty in the future 
inability to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel necessary to support the growth of our business could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with possible regulation under state or federal franchise laws in may  the texas department of transportation notified us that  in their opinion  our performance based pricing model is illegal  because it makes us a broker under texas law 
they have taken the position that the fee paid to us by member dealers for each qualified purchase inquiry is equivalent to a broker s fee and that we are arranging for two persons to meet and enter into a transaction that involves the sale of a motor vehicle 
in september the texas department of transportation sent a letter to the same effect to our texas member dealers  and as a result one of our largest member dealer groups severed its business relationship with us 
shortly after the department s letter was sent to our texas member dealers  we modified our pricing model 
to date the department has taken no other action against us or our member dealers based on our pricing model 
a proposal to modify the regulations governing how the texas brokering law is enforced passed in february we have received written notice from the texas department of transportation that our newly revised pricing model comforms to the new regulations 
we generally face risks associated with possible regulation under vehicle brokerage  insurance  financing or other laws other states  substantially all of which have laws that broadly define brokerage activities  could determine that we are acting as a broker 
if this occurs  we may be required to comply with burdensome licensing requirements or terminate our operations in those states 
in either case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that our service does not qualify as a vehicle brokerage activity and therefore that state broker licensing requirements do not apply to us 
however  we have not sought a legal opinion regarding whether our service  in general  or our performance based pricing  in particular  would qualify us as a vehicle brokerage activity in any state 
state regulatory requirements may also include us within an industry specific regulatory scheme  such as those for the vehicle insurance or vehicle financing industries 
in the event that individual states regulatory requirements change or additional requirements are imposed on us  we may be required to modify aspects of our business in those states in a manner that might undermine the attractiveness of the autoweb 
com purchase process to consumers  member dealers  vehicle manufacturers  category partners or advertisers or require us to terminate operations in that state  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are numerous state laws regarding the sale of vehicles 
in addition  government authorities may take the position that state or federal insurance licensing laws  motor vehicle dealer laws or related consumer protection or product liability laws apply to aspects of our business 
as we introduce new services and expand our operations to other countries  we will need to comply with additional licensing and regulatory requirements 
we face risks associated with government regulation and legal uncertainties associated with the internet a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  including  but not limited to  online content  user privacy  taxation  access charges  liability for third party activities and jurisdiction 
additionally  it is uncertain as to how existing laws will be applied to the internet 
the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws may decrease the growth in the use of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the tax treatment of the internet and e commerce is currently unsettled 
a number of proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level and by certain foreign governments that could impose taxes on the sale of goods and services and certain other internet activities 
recently  the internet tax information act was signed into law placing a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet commerce 
however  we cannot assure you that future laws imposing taxes or other regulations on commerce over the internet would not substantially impair the growth of e commerce and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure  and that many areas with high internet use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers and online service providers 
if such access fees are imposed  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially slowing the increasing use of the internet  which could in turn decrease demand for our services or increase our cost of doing business  and thus have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on increased use of the internet our future success and revenue growth depends substantially upon continued growth in the use of the internet 
consumers and businesses will likely widely accept and adopt the internet for conducting business and exchanging information only if the internet provides these consumers and businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements in commerce and communication 
in addition  e commerce generally  and the purchase of automotive and automotive related products and services on the internet in particular  must become widespread 
the internet may prove not to be a viable commercial marketplace generally  or  in particular  for vehicles and related products and services 
if use of the internet does not continue to increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on continued improvements in our systems and the internet infrastructure our ability to retain and attract consumers  member dealers  vehicle manufacturers  category partners and advertisers  and to achieve market acceptance of our services and our brand  depends significantly upon the performance of our systems and network infrastructure 
any system or network failure that causes interruption or slower response time of our services could result in less traffic to our web site and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services to consumers  member dealers  category partners and advertisers 
an increase in the volume of our web site traffic could strain the capacity of our technical infrastructure  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
this would cause the number of purchase inquiries  advertising impressions  other revenue producing e commerce offerings and our information and community offerings to decline  any of which could hinder our revenue growth and our brand loyalty 
in addition  if traffic increases  we cannot assure you that our technical infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed and data capacity and the development of complementary products such as high speed modems  will be able to increase accordingly  and we face risks related to our ability to scale up to expected consumer levels while maintaining performance 
further  security and authentication concerns regarding the transmission of confidential information over the internet  such as credit card numbers  may continue 
any failure of our server and networking systems ability to handle current or higher volumes of traffic would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the recent growth in internet traffic has caused frequent periods of decreased performance  requiring internet service providers and users of the internet to upgrade their infrastructures 
if internet usage continues to increase rapidly  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
if outages or delays on the internet occur frequently  overall internet usage or usage of our web site could increase more slowly or decline 
our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of such services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services is dependent on future improvements to the entire internet 
in addition  our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  some of which are located at our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
we do have a backup disaster recovery program and fully redundant systems for our service at an off site location hosted by exodus communications  inc while this offsite location does provide a significant amount of security and scalability there is no guarantee that the system is not vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the internet industry is characterized by rapid technological change rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards and consumer demands  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the market for internet products and services 
these market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services in the near future 
our future success will significantly depend on our ability to continually improve the vehicle purchasing experience  the addition of new and useful services and content to our web site  and the performance  features and reliability of our web site 
in addition  the widespread adoption of developing multimedia enabling technologies could require fundamental and costly changes in our technology and affect the nature  viability and measurability of internet based advertising  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could face liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet and liability for products sold over the internet we could be exposed to liability with respect to third party information that may be accessible through our web site  or content and materials that may be posted by consumers through our autotalk or car review services 
such claims might assert  among other things  that  by directly or indirectly providing links to web sites operated by third parties  we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through such web sites 
it is also possible that  if any third party content information provided on our web site contains errors  consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information 
we also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenue that results from the purchase of services through direct links to or from our web site is shared 
such arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties  including local  state  federal and foreign government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services  even if we do not provide the services ourselves 
we cannot assure you that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these parties  if available  will be adequate 
even to the extent such claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against such claims 
the imposition upon us for potential liability of information carried on or disseminated through our system could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which might require the expenditure of substantial resources or limit the attractiveness of our services to consumers  member dealers  category partners and others 
our general liability insurance and our communications liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our intellectual property protection may be inadequate legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and still evolving  and we can give no assurance regarding the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
despite the precautions we have taken  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
we are aware that the mark autoweb is a federally registered trademark of another party and that other parties have registered the mark internationally  the mark is already in use in several regions in the united states and internationally 
we have applied for a us and a foreign trademark registration for autoweb associated with the services we provide  however  we cannot guarantee that we will receive the applied for registrations or be able to continue to use the name autoweb in the future 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to use the name autoweb in the future 
if in the future we were required to change our name and adopt a new trademark  we would incur significant expenses related to marketing a replacement trademark  and such a change would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with litigation litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
furthermore  our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others and other parties may assert infringement claims against us  including patent claims or claims that arise from directly or indirectly providing hyperlink text links to web sites operated by third parties 
moreover  from time to time  we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement by us or our member dealers of the trademarks  service marks  patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
such claims and any resultant litigation  should it occur  might subject us to significant liability for damages  might result in invalidation of our proprietary rights and  even if not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on third party technology we currently license from third parties certain technologies and information incorporated into our web site 
as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and information  we may be required to license additional technology and information from others 
we cannot assure you that these third party technology and information licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
additionally  we cannot assure you that the third parties from which we currently license our technology and information will be able to defend their proprietary rights successfully against claims of infringement 
any failure to obtain any of these technology and information licenses could result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new features  functions or services 
it could also adversely affect the performance of our existing services until equivalent technology or information can be identified  obtained and integrated 
we may particularly be affected by general economic conditions purchases of new vehicles are typically discretionary for consumers and may be particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy 
the success of our operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions and perceptions by consumers affecting disposable consumer income such as employment  wages and salaries  business conditions  interest rates  availability of credit and taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate 
in addition  because the purchase of a vehicle is a significant investment and is relatively discretionary  any reduction in disposable income in general may affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
in addition  our business strategy relies on advertising by and agreements with other internet companies 
any significant deterioration in general economic conditions that adversely affects these companies could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have security risks on occasion  some experienced programmers hackers have attempted to penetrate our network security 
we expect that these attempts  some of which have succeeded  will continue to occur from time to time 
because a hacker who penetrates our network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services  we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
additionally  we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 
such security breaches and inadvertent transmissions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in offering certain online payment services  we may increasingly rely on technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information  such as consumer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect our consumers transaction data or our software vendors products 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter use of the internet in general or use of the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or downloading sensitive materials 
we have risks associated with international operations and expansions a part of our long term strategy is to establish autoweb 
com in international markets 
however  the internet  or our commerce  content and community services model  may not become widely accepted in any market 
in addition  we expect that the success of any additional foreign operations we initiate will be substantially dependent upon our member dealers  category partners and content services 
we may experience difficulty in managing international operations as a result of failure to identify an effective foreign partner  competition  technical problems  local laws and regulations  distance and language and cultural differences 
our international partners may not be able to successfully market and operate our community model in foreign markets 
there are also certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including 
cultural and business practices differences  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
political issues  
legal and economic instability  
seasonal reductions in business activity in certain other parts of the world  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
one or more of such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition
