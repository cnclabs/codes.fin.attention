these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in the amount of expense related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients  which is at a higher percentage of net revenue 
in addition  due to tight labor markets  these savings were partially offset by wage inflation 
we anticipate such wage inflation pressures will continue for the foreseeable future

lab fees and dental supplies expense increased from  or of net revenue for to  or of net revenue for lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
the increase in lab fees and dental supplies as a percentage of net revenue is attributable to a combination of the acquisition of facilities with a generally higher ratio of lab fees and dental supplies expense to net revenue in their respective markets compared to the existing base of facilities and rate increases from certain lab providers and dental supply manufacturers 
we believe such price inflation will continue for the foreseeable future

other operating expenses 
other expenses amounted to  or of net revenue for  as compared with  or of net revenue for other costs decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the regionalization of administrative functions in certain markets and the reduction of certain discretionary spending

despite these additions  we continued to leverage these costs  resulting in a reduction of general corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
the level of general corporate expenses will likely continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand our management infrastructure 
however  it is anticipated that these expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of net revenue 
depreciation 
depreciation expense was  or of net revenue for  as compared with  or of net revenue for the increase in depreciation expense related primarily to the depreciation of assets acquired and capital expenditures associated with the addition of eleven new facilities in arizona  california  minnesota and virginia and the relocation and or expansion of facilities in arizona  minnesota  texas and wisconsin throughout and these capital expenditures increased our capacity in these markets to allow for future growth 
depreciation expense increased as a percentage of net revenue as this initial investment was not fully offset by incremental net revenue 
we expect to continue to invest in the relocation and expansion of our physical capacity  and depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation expense will likely increase 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was  or of net revenue for  as compared with  or of net revenue for the increase in amortization resulted from intangible assets recorded in connection with our ten affiliations completed during and affiliations transactions completed during we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase in the future as a result of intangibles recorded in connection with future acquisitions and affiliations

net interest expense was  or of net revenue for  as compared with  or of net revenue for the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facility in as compared to average borrowings in were significantly lower than in due in large part to using a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the issuance of subordinated notes in connection with the and transactions contributed to higher expense in this increase in interest expense was partially reduced due to an overall lower average interest rate under our revolving credit facility in than income taxes 
we incurred income tax expense of  for  as compared with  for our effective tax rate was approximately for as compared with for the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the fact that the remaining net operating loss carryforwards from were fully utilized to offset a portion of our taxable income in in addition  higher pre tax income in resulted in a higher federal statutory rate and increased income in states with higher tax rates increased the average state tax rate 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the proportionate amount of amortization of intangible assets which are not deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  from sales of equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations 
from january  through december   we completed dental practice affiliations transactions for aggregate consideration of  in cash   in subordinated promissory notes   in deferred payments   shares of common stock and future contingent payments for one affiliation based on a multiple of service fees received in excess of a predetermined threshold for each of the three years ending may   and for the year ended may   this contingent payment amounted to for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from operations resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of cash paid for income taxes and interest in compared to this was partially offset by an increase in cash from operations due to incremental earnings generated from acquisitions and affiliations  same market growth and expanded profit margins 
for the years ended december  and  cash used in investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities included cash used for acquisitions and affiliations and for capital expenditures 
cash used for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was  for and  for cash used for capital expenditures was  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the addition of three new dental facilities in minnesota  a new dental facility in arizona and the relocation and or expansion of eleven dental facilities in minnesota  texas and wisconsin 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the addition of seven new dental facilities in arizona  california  minnesota and virginia and the relocation and or expansion of dental facilities in arizona  minnesota  texas and wisconsin 
the establishment of new dental facilities and the expansion of existing dental facilities in the future will require ongoing capital expenditures 
although we expect to continue making meaningful capital expenditures  we do not expect capital expenditures to continue at the same level as for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities during resulted primarily from net proceeds received from our initial public offering 
during the second quarter of  we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering at per share 
net proceeds to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs were approximately  such proceeds were used to i redeem all the series b redeemable preferred stock  including unpaid dividends  in the amount of  ii repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  including accrued interest  in the amount of  and iii complete additional affiliation transactions 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted from borrowings under our revolving line of credit of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan of  offset by the repayment of certain indebtedness of  and the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  we have a million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility is being used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and affiliations 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin for libor loans is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges up to 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee of of the average daily balance of the unused line 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on adjusted ebitda 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
the line of credit matures in december the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission registration no 
covering a total of  shares of common stock and  aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to be issued in connection with future dental practice affiliations 
as of december    shares and  of notes remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
our growth strategy depends in large measure on our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
subsequent to december   we acquired substantially all the assets of three dental practices and simultaneously entered into a year service agreement with one of the affiliated dental groups two practices joined existing affiliates 
the aggregate purchase price paid in connection with these transactions consisted of approximately million in cash  million in subordinated promissory notes and million in deferred payments 
the cash portion of this purchase price was funded through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
although we have affiliated with many dental practices since our initial affiliation in november  there can be no assurance that additional affiliation candidates can be identified  consummated or successfully integrated into our operations 
we have used a combination of cash  common stock and subordinated debt as consideration for past acquisitions and affiliations and plan to continue to use these sources in the future 
in the event that our common stock does not maintain sufficient valuation or if potential affiliation candidates are unwilling to accept our securities as consideration  we will be required to use more cash resources to continue our affiliation program 
in addition  if sufficient financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  our affiliation strategy will be modified 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions and affiliations although at a reduced rate compared to for at least the next months 
year issue the year issue is the result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the year 
accordingly  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations  including the temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or statements  or engage in similar normal business activities 
we utilize software and related computer technologies essential to our operations 
we have not experienced any material year problems or disruptions in our systems or operations  and the costs we have incurred in addressing year compliance have not been material 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not experience year problems that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in money market instruments 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate or market risk 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for a one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
