as noted above see item  recent developments upon its acquisition by the company  paisano publications obtained an aggregate of  in nomura indebtedness 
this financing was comprised of  of senior term loans the term loans and  of revolving loans the revolving loans 
the proceeds from the term loans plus  of the revolving loans were used to repay certain promissory notes issued to the shareholder of the paisano companies in conjunction with the paisano acquisition see note to consolidated financial statements and to pay certain acquisition expenses 
to the extent that paisano publications is in compliance with the terms of the nomura indebtedness  any unused portion of the revolving loans may be used by paisano publications for working capital purposes 
at december   there was  of available borrowings under the revolving loans subject to the approval of the lender 
in february  an additional  was drawn on the loan reducing the available balance to  as discussed above under item business information about easyriders recent developments  the lender has waived the defaults that existed under the nomura indebtedness as of december  and the company is now in compliance with the terms of the nomura indebtedness 
the nomura indebtedness is guaranteed the guarantees by the company and the paisano companies  other than paisano publications the guarantors 
the nomura indebtedness will mature on september   and bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate of the lender from time to time plus  payable monthly 
the nomura indebtedness and the guarantees are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets owned or hereafter acquired of the company and the paisano companies  including all of the capital stock or equity interests of the paisano companies  and newriders 
the nomura indebtedness and the guarantees constitute the sole senior secured indebtedness of paisano publications and guarantors and rank senior to all other indebtedness of paisano publications and the guarantors 
with respect to the september  maturity  the company has begun to explore alternative financing sources and believes it will be able to either negotiate with nomura an extension of the maturity date  or to refinance the nomura indebtedness with other lenders and or investors 
at the end of each one month period in which the term loans are outstanding  paisano publications is required to prepay the term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to of excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  for such period  to the extent such excess cash flow is achieved 
because this prepayment is dependent upon the company achieving excess cash flow  which is dependent on uncertain future events  no amounts have been classified as current liabilities at december  subject to certain limitations on dividends  provided that no event of default has occurred  paisano publications may advance funds to the company monthly  limited to the lesser of  or of the excess cash flow for the preceding monthly period 
as of december   paisano publications has been able to provide  of funding to the company based on paisano s attainment of excess cash flow 
the inability of paisano publications to provide funds to the company can adversely impact the ability of the company to repay certain expenses of the company 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
because the nomura indebtedness includes restrictions on the ability of the paisano companies to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances  the net assets of the paisano companies are considered to be restricted 
the restricted net assets of the paisano companies on december  total  the nomura indebtedness contains numerous operating and financial covenants  including but not limited to  payment of dividends  limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of minimum net worth  minimum working capital  interest coverage ratios and the achievement of cash flow measures 
based on the results for the year ended december   paisano was in violation of several of the financial covenants including the required leverage ratio  the required minimum consolidated ebitda and the required interest coverage ratio 
as of april   the company received waivers related to events of non compliance 
as noted above see item recent developments in connection with the paisano acquisition  the company issued contributor notes in the aggregate amount of  to joseph teresi  the sole shareholder of the paisano companies prior to the paisano acquisition 
the contributor notes consist of a subordinated promissory note in the amount of  a limited recourse subordinated promissory note in the amount of  secured by the martin mirror note as defined in the applicable instruments and a short term subordinated promissory note in the amount of  the first two notes the subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate that may vary from to and may be extended for an additional five years 
the remaining  the short term note was initially issued as a day note that bears interest at an annual rate of 
by mutual agreement  the maturity on the short term note was subsequently extended to march  as of april   the company was in default in repayment of the  short term note  and for interest of  on the subordinated notes 
on april   joseph teresi waived the default which existed on that date with respect to the non payment of interest on the  short term note 
in addition  mr 
teresi agreed that between march  and march  he would not make any claim of default in connection with the non payment of principal under the  short term note  and that between march  and march   he would not make any claim of default for interest which was due as of march  or which would accrue between march  and march  in october  paisano publications issued a  increasing rate secured promissory note to an investment partnership  siena capital partners  lp this loan the siena loan is subordinate to the nomura indebtedness 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum increasing by monthly beginning april   and is due and payable with accrued interest on october  warrants to purchase  shares of the common stock of the company were issued with an exercise price of per share 
if the siena loan has been paid off in its entirety by april   the warrants become null and void 
in addition  if the balance is not paid in full by july   the company must issue warrants to purchase an additional  shares of the common stock of the company  and if the balance is not paid in full by october   the company must issue warrants to purchase an additional  shares of the common stock of the company 
thereafter  until the loan is paid in full  the company must issue warrants to purchase  shares of the common stock of the company on the th day of each month 
as of april  the company did not possess the resources to pay off the siena loan 
however  john martin and joseph teresi were granted a right of first refusal in connection with any assignment of the siena loan 
based on this right  the company pursued negotiations with mr 
teresi and mr 
martin concerning their assumption of the siena loan upon terms more favorable to the company 
these negotiations were successful and on april   mr 
martin and mr 
teresi each paid to siena the sum of  and assumed the position of siena with respect to the siena loan 
concurrently  the first  warrants vested  and mr 
martin and mr 
teresi agreed to make the following modifications to the siena loan terms 
the interest rate will be reduced from per annum to per annum 

provided the siena loan is paid off by december   twenty percent of all warrants vested by and through such date will be surrendered 
these modifications are subject to the formal consent of nomura  which the company is confident will be secured 
the company continues in its attempts to secure a cash infusion and to accelerate cash flow  through the pursuit of various approaches  including selling certain assets  drawing down funds available under the revolving credit portion of the nomura credit agreement and consummating certain business transactions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is also evaluating the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
while the company believes that such efforts  together with ongoing operations  will enable the company to meet its anticipated cash needs for the next months  there can be no assurance that this will be the case  as projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
in the event that the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise capital beyond that which is projected to be realized from current operations  the company will not be able to meet its liquidity obligations

sfas no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued which delays the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including paper price volatility and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of its debt 
paper price volatility a primary component of the company s cost of revenues in the magazine publishing segment is the cost of paper 
consequently  increases in paper prices can adversely impact the company results of operations 
interest rates the company is subject to certain interest rate risk related to the term loans 
the term loans mature on september  and bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate of the lender plus payable monthly 
the interest rate on the balance of  outstanding on december  was 
an increase in interest rates of would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  the company s remaining long term debt and convertible debentures have fixed interest rates and therefore the company does not believe a increase in interest rates would have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
