 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june this statement will become effective for the company for fiscal year the company is evaluating the effect of this statement on its accounting and reporting policies  but does not presently expect adoption to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
information systems implementations and year issue the company has converted and replaced its legacy information technology it systems and believes that with this conversion the year issue has been mitigated 
the company has also replaced systems used in the manufacture and distribution of its products and does not anticipate disruptions in the supply of products to its customers 
the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues such as leap year related problems may occur with closings at month  quarterly or year end 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively impacted if its customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen with respect to its customers and suppliers 
it expenditures  including system enhancements and non it year projects  were million through december   of which million has been expensed 
substantially all of the costs incurred relate to replacement costs for hardware and software  which will provide enhanced functionality over the company s prior it systems 
litigation the company  like other manufacturers  is subject to product liability claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
et litigation the company is a defendant or co defendant in nine lawsuits filed against the company in the superior court of california by building owners or insurers in los angeles county arising from alleged property damage claimed to have been discovered after the northridge earthquake of january these cases include claims for compensatory damages and punitive damages  often without specification of amount  relating to the sale and use of the et category of welding electrode 
one of the complaints includes a fraud claim  as well as a claim under california s unfair business practices act 
the latter claim demands restitution of all amounts paid by california purchasers for the company s et electrode  with interest 
the company has also been a defendant or co defendant in other similar cases involving steel frame buildings in greater los angeles following the northridge earthquake 
six of those cases were voluntarily dismissed and the company has settled the six other cases 
all settlement costs have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
no trial on the merits has occurred to date in any of the et cases 
moreover  as referenced above  at least one of the pending et cases also presents theories of liability that did not exist in the cases that were dismissed or settled 
therefore  the company is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of possible losses that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the remaining pending or future et litigation 
management believes the company has substantial defenses and intends to contest such suits vigorously  that the company has applicable insurance and that other potential defendants and their respective insurers will be identified as the lawsuits proceed 
the company s results of operations or cash flows in one or more interim or annual periods could be materially affected by unfavorable results in one or more of these cases 
based on the information known to the company  and subject to the factors and contingencies noted herein  management believes the outcome of the company s et litigation should not have a material adverse impact upon the consolidated financial position of the company 
if the company is unsuccessful in defending or otherwise satisfactorily resolving this litigation  and if insurance coverage is unavailable or inadequate  then the litigation could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
other litigation the company is also a defendant in a large number of cases alleging injuries due to exposure to manganese  asbestos and other substances 
in each instance  the company is one of a large number of defendants 
the company is co defendant in cases involving individual plaintiffs alleging that exposure to manganese contained in arc welding electrode products caused the plaintiffs to develop a neurological condition known as manganism 
the company is also a co defendant in cases involving claims by approximately  plaintiffs alleging asbestos induced illness 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously 
all costs associated with these claims  including defense and settlements  have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
based on the company s historical experience in litigating these claims  including a significant number of dismissals  summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts  the company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including those portions of this management s discussion and analysis that refer to the future may contain forward looking statements that are not historical facts 
those statements are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements  and the company s future performance  operating results  financial position and liquidity  are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect results  including competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive global environment and is subject to a variety of competitive factors such as pricing  the actions and strength of its competitors  and the company s ability to maintain its position as a recognized leader in welding technology 
the intensity of foreign competition is substantially affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the company s competitive position could also be adversely affected should new or emerging entrants particularly where foreign currencies have been significantly devalued become more active in the arc welding business 
international markets 
the company s long term strategy is to increase its share in growing international markets  particularly asia  latin america  central europe and other developing markets 
however  there can be no certainty that the company will be successful in its expansion efforts 
the company is subject to the currency risks of doing business abroad  and expansion poses challenging demands within the company s infrastructure 
further  many developing economies have deteriorated over the last months and are now experiencing political and economic instability  making international growth difficult 
litigation 
the company  like other manufacturers  is subject to a variety of lawsuits and potential lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
see litigation discussion above and note k to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of litigation 
cyclicality and maturity of the welding industry 
the united states arc welding industry is both mature and cyclical 
the growth of the domestic arc welding industry has been and continues to be constrained by numerous factors  including the substitution of plastics and other materials in place of fabricated metal parts in many products and structures 
increased offshore production of fabricated steel structures has also cut into the domestic demand for arc welding products 
operating factors 
the company is highly dependent on its skilled workforce and efficient production facilities  which could be adversely affected by its labor relations  business interruptions at its domestic facilities and short term or long term interruptions in the availability of supplies or raw materials or in transportation of finished goods 
research and development 
the company s continued success depends  in part  on its ability to continue to meet customer welding needs through the introduction of new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics 
there can be no assurances that new products or product improvements  once developed  will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to the operating results of the company  or that product development will continue at a pace to sustain future growth 
item a 
market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany loans and intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the income statement 
at december  the company had approximately million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts which primarily hedged recorded balance sheet exposures or firm commitments 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage the company s exposure to price risk from commodity purchases 
the primary commodity hedged is copper 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december   would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
at december   the fair value of notes payable approximated carrying value due to its short term maturities 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company utilizes an interest rate swap as a hedge to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate of its fixed rate debt without actually changing the debt instrument 
the swap involves the exchange of the company s fixed rate debt for a floating rate based on a month libor basket swap plus a spread of basis points 
payments or receipts on the agreement are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
a increase in the month libor basket swap rate would increase the amount paid by approximately million annually 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt instruments
