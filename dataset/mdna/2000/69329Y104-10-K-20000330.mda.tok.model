item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our founding in  a primary focus of our operations has been research and development 
achievement of successful research and development and commercialization of products derived from our efforts is subject to high levels of risk and significant resource commitments 
our expenses have generally exceeded revenues 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that our losses may increase because of the extensive resource commitments required to achieve regulatory approval and commercial success for any individual product 
for example  over the next several years  we will incur substantial additional expenses as we continue to develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in new research areas and improve and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
since we or our collaborative partners or licensees may not be able to successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or successfully market such products with desired margins  we may never achieve profitable operations 
the amount of net losses and the time required to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability 
our commitment of resources to the development of zenapax and the humanized anti il antibody  two humanized antibodies with respect to which we recently obtained development rights  taken together with the continued development of our existing products  will require significant additional funds for development 
these operating expenses may also increase as some of our earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as we invest in additional manufacturing capacity  as we defend or prosecute our patents and patent applications  and as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights  product sales or other uncertain sources of revenue  we will incur substantial operating losses 
our revenues have varied in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
as a result  our revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period 
our royalty revenues may be unpredictable and may fluctuate since they depend upon the seasonality of sales of licensed products  the existence of competing products  the marketing efforts of our licensees  potential reductions in royalties payable to us due to credits for prior payments to us  the timing of royalty reports  some of which are required quarterly and others semi annually  our method of accounting for royalty revenues from our licensees and our ability to successfully defend and enforce our patents 
other revenue may also be unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of payments of non recurring licensing and signing fees and payments for manufacturing services and achievement of milestones under new and existing collaborative  humanization  and patent licensing agreements 
revenue historically recognized under our prior agreements may not be an indicator of revenue from any future collaborations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we are evaluating the effects  if any  that sab and the adoption of sab in the second quarter of  may have on the results of our operations or our financial position 
in addition  our expenses may be unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  which may include payments owed by us under licensing arrangements and due to our policy of recording expenses under collaborative agreements during the quarter in which such expenses are reported to us 
results of operations years ended december   and our total revenues were million in as compared to million in and million in total research and development revenues represented million  million and million of total revenues in  and  respectively 
research and development revenues include royalties  licensing and signing fees  milestone payments  research and development reimbursement funding and license maintenance fees 
the increase in total research and development revenues in from the prior years was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties during the period 
of the amounts we expended for research and development  million in  million in and million in represented third party funded research and development activities not including licensing and signing fees  milestone payments and product sales 
interest and other income decreased to million in from and million in and  respectively 
this decrease in is primarily attributable to the decreased interest earned on our lower investment balances as a result of cash used in our operating activities 
total costs and expenses increased to million in from million in and million in in  we incurred a non cash special charge of million associated with the extension of the term of certain stock options that were granted prior to february the special charge is expected to be non recurring and conforms the term of previously granted stock options  which was six years  to those granted beginning february  ten years 
exercise prices of the stock options were not altered 
research and development expenses in increased to million from million in and million in the increase in costs and expenses as compared to was primarily a result of the addition of staff  the initiation and continuation of clinical trials and expansion of pharmaceutical development capabilities including support for both clinical development and manufacturing process development 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in and million in these increases were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our expanding operations 
liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  research and development revenues  interest income on invested capital and a private placement of million in convertible subordinated notes in february at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  this decrease in cash resources in primarily reflects our purchase of our fremont  california headquarters and research and development facility in september and increased research and development expenditures 
in  we invested approximately million in our new fremont  california headquarters and research and development facility for construction of these new facilities and related improvements  including expanded laboratory and development facilities 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash used in our operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to our purchase of our fremont  california headquarters and research and development facility in september and increased research and development expenditures 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by our investing activities of million in and used in our investing activities of million in the change in was primarily the result of our reinvestment activities associated with the purchases of short and long term investments 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash provided by our financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the change in was primarily the result of the exercise of outstanding stock options and proceeds associated with the long term financing of our purchase of our fremont  california facilities 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from sales of products of third party licensees  including synagis  herceptin and zenapax  our ability to enter into additional collaborative  humanization and patent licensing arrangements  progress of product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of our licensees to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products licensed under our patents  the continued or additional support by our collaborative partners or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  enhancement of existing and investment in new research and development programs  time required to gain regulatory approvals  resources we devote to self funded products  manufacturing facilities and methods and advanced technologies  our ability to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative arrangements  our continued development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize our potential products we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
we believe that existing capital resources including the proceeds of the issue and sale in february of  of our convertible subordinated notes due february   will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least year compliance update we did not experience any computer or systems problems relating to the year upon review of our internal and external systems during  we determined that we did not have any material exposure to such computer problems and that the software and systems required to operate our business and provide our services were year compliant 
as a result  we did not incur  and do not expect to incur  any material expenditures relating to year systems remediation 
item a 
market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million
