item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by its banks 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to million of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions of marietta savings  first federal  first savings and gf bancorp and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the banks could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offered 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth by integrating its residential lending function through establishing mortgage banking operations in the banks primary market areas and  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the banks operations are decentralized  with a separate board of directors and management team focusing on consumer preferences for financial products in the respective communities served 
based on consumer preferences  camco s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent banks from its competition 
management believes that the banks abilities to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s net earnings have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including gains on sale of loans  loan servicing fees and other fees 
camco s operations are also influenced by non interest expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the december  total 
the growth in assets was primarily funded by an increase of million in advances from the fhlb  deposit growth of million and an increase in stockholders equity of million 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
the decrease reflects the use of available funds to help finance the adjustable rate loan growth in the portfolio and the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities throughout investment securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over the total at december  during  investment securities totaling million were purchased  while maturities amounted to million 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over december   due primarily to purchases totaling million and principal repayments totaling million during the period 
loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over the total at december  the increase was primarily attributable to loan disbursements of million  which were partially offset by principal repayments of million and loan sales of million 
loan origination volume during was less than the record volume by million  or  while the volume of loan sales decreased by million year to year 
the decrease in loan volume was primarily attributable to a decrease in refinancing activity due to the increase in interest rates during the year 
the decrease in sales volume resulted from a shift in consumer preference to adjustable rate loans resulting from the overall increase in interest rates in the economy 
nonperforming loans days or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting 
and 
of total net loans  including loans held for sale at those dates 
the consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
the provision for losses on loans for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the aforementioned growth in the loan portfolio during although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over december  levels 
the increase resulted primarily from management s continuing efforts to achieve a moderate rate of growth through advertising and pricing strategies 
advances from the fhlb increased by million  or  to a total of million at december  the proceeds from deposit growth and fhlb advances were primarily used to fund both new loan originations and the purchase of investments and mortgage backed securities during the banks are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations 
at december   each of the banks regulatory capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net earnings for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of net earnings reported in while net interest income increased by million  the overall decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease in other income of million and an increase in general  administrative and other expense of  which were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for federal income taxes of  and a decrease in the provision for losses on loans of  net interest income 
total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  an increase of million  or  over  generally reflecting the effects of the million  or  of growth in average interest earning assets outstanding year to year  partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the average yield  from in to in interest income on loans and mortgage backed securities totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the comparable period  which was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield from in to in the increase resulted primarily from a million  or  growth in the average balance outstanding year to year

a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the banks  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the banks market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the banks loan portfolios 
the provision for losses on loans totaled  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from the provision recorded in the current period provision generally reflects the effects of loan portfolio growth coupled with a decrease of  in the level of nonperforming loans year to year 
in the period subsequent to december   approximately  of the nonperforming loans have been paid off or paid to current status

the primary sources of funds for the banks are deposits  principal and interest payments made on the portfolio loans  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans  maturing investments  fhlb advances and funds provided by operating activities 
principal uses of funds include deposit withdrawals  loan originations  investment purchases  repayment of fhlb advances  payment of interest on deposits and payment of operating expenses 
while certain of these sources and uses of funds are relatively predictable  deposit flows  loan originations and prepayments of loans are influenced by external factors such as interest rates  economic conditions  competition and consumer confidence in financial service industries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk net interest income  the difference between asset yields and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  is the principal component of camco s net earnings 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rate levels 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which a financial institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing during a specified interval 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect 
in recognition of the foregoing factors  the board of directors of each of the banks has implemented an asset and liability management strategy directed toward improving each bank s interest rate sensitivity 
the principal common elements of such strategies include meeting the consumer preference for fixed rate loans over the past several years by selling such loans in the secondary market  originating adjustable rate mortgage loans arms as demand increases coincident with the overall rise in interest rates in the economy  maintaining higher levels of liquid assets  such as cash  short term interest bearing deposits and short term investment securities as a hedge against rising interest rates in a lower interest rate environment  and utilizing fhlb advances and longer term certificates of deposit as funding sources when available 
the following table contains information regarding the amounts of various categories of assets and liabilities repricing within the periods indicated december  within year years over years total in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits in other banks investment securities    mortgage backed securities    loans receivable     total     interest bearing liabilities deposits     fhlb advances     total     excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities     cumulative excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are shown as repricing based on contractual terms to repricing  without consideration of loan prepayments or deposit decay assumptions
