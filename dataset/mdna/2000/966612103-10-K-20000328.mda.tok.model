item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation the company and its subsidiaries and on their results of operations during  and the company s principal subsidiary is whitney national bank the bank  in which virtually all of the company s operations are contained 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report  particularly the preceding consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain financial information in prior years has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview during and  the company made six business acquisitions as detailed in note  and the company incurred conversion and other merger expenses related to the acquisitions in each of these years

the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased million  or  from to strong loan growth of in continued to have a favorable impact on the mix of earning assets  while the mix of funding sources remained relatively stable and the company effectively managed its funding costs 
the net interest margin remained strong at in compared to in o total non interest income increased million  or 
a growing customer base and healthy market area economies contributed to strong improvements in income from deposit service charges  merchant processing fees and other fees from credit and debit card transactions  and trust service fees 
these factors and a favorable rate environment also contributed to the growth in income from secondary mortgage market operations  although the pace of this growth slowed toward the end of with rising market rates 
o non interest expense  excluding merger related expenses  increased at a slower rate  rising million  or  between and expense control programs begun in late had a favorable impact on the growth rate of several major expense categories  including personnel expense and net occupancy expense 
s non interest expense had also been unfavorably impacted by unexpected employee benefit costs and certain other items 
o sustained loan growth was the primary factor behind the million provision for possible loan losses during compared to a nominal provision in page of pages o the company executed a million stock repurchase program for one million shares during as part of its ongoing efforts to effectively manage its capital position 
earnings before tax effected merger related expenses decreased by million in from growth in taxable equivalent net interest income of million  or  resulted primarily from a increase in average loans 
non interest income grew by million  or  primarily because of increases in credit card income and trust service fees resulting from increased business in those areas 
offsetting these positive factors was a million change in the provision for possible loan losses and a million  or  increase in non interest expense over  excluding merger related expenses 
personnel expense rose with the hiring of key employees  increased incentive compensation expense and unexpectedly high health claims 
branch network expansion  including the branches purchased in lake charles  louisiana  also contributed to the increase in non interest expense  as did expenses related to enhancements to communications and data processing hardware and software  and increased credit card processing charges 
forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report may be regarded as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements  made in good faith by the company  are based on a number of assumptions about the future 
some of the more important assumptions include i expectations about overall economic strength and the performance of the economies in the company s market area  ii expectations about the movement of interest rates  including actions that may be taken by the federal reserve board in response to changing economic conditions  iii reliance on existing or anticipated changes in laws and regulations affecting the activities of the banking industry and other financial service providers  and iv expectations regarding the nature and level of competition  changes in consumer behavior and preferences  and the company s ability to execute its plans to respond effectively 
because it is uncertain whether future conditions and events will confirm the company s assumptions  there is a risk that the company s future results will differ materially from what is stated in or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the reader to consider this risk 
loans and reserve for possible loan losses average loans grew million in compared to an increase in of million  or in each period 
table  which is based on regulatory collateral codes  shows the company has experienced significant loan growth in most all major categories 
table loans outstanding by type december dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural loans      real estate loans commercial and other      real estate loans retail mortgage      loans to individuals      lease financing     total loans      as can be seen in table  commercial loans increased million  or  between year end and commercial real estate lending  which includes loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations  supplied million of this overall increase  growing 
recent growth has come from a variety of sources 
a strong convention and tourism industry in the new orleans metropolitan area continued to spur demand for hotel construction in  and several new developments are planned for hotel loans were approximately of total commercial real estate loans at year end the bank does not provide permanent financing for all of its projects  and this percentage is not expected to grow in the economic health of the company s eastern gulf coast markets and the attractiveness of page of pages this area as a resort destination are behind the growth in apartment and condominium projects financed by the bank 
the bank has also increased its financing of a variety of retail  small office and other commercial facilities in this region and throughout its market areas 
commercial loans other than those secured by real property increased million  or  from the end of loans to customers in the oil and gas industry increased million in  primarily to companies involved in production support and services  as underlying commodity prices rebounded near the end of the activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain of the company s market areas  particularly southern louisiana 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers totaled million  or of total loans 
another area of substantial growth in was in loans secured by collateral other than real estate to provide customers with venture capital funds  although such loans represent only approximately of the portfolio 
loans to retailers were relatively stable  while loans to manufacturers and wholesalers declined  partly as a result of out of market acquisitions of local companies 
the overall growth in commercial lending also reflects the company s ability to develop its customer base in its newer market areas and to take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established markets 
retail loans  including both retail mortgage loans and other loans to individuals  increased million  or  between and all of this growth was in the retail mortgage loan category which increased in growth in the origination of adjustable rate mortgage loan products  particularly as market rates rose in the second half of  was a large factor behind this increase 
the company originates conventional fixed rate mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the successful promotion of the company s fixed term home equity loan product was also an important factor in the growth of this loan category 
this product offers customers the opportunity to leverage rising home values and equity to obtain tax advantaged consumer financing 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than retail mortgage loan products 
the company s exit from one segment of this market and consumer preference for tax advantaged home equity financing impeded growth in this category which was stable between and the customer focused retail sales training program conducted company wide in produced enhanced sales efforts that supported the overall growth in retail loans in table reflects contractual loan maturities  unadjusted for scheduled principal reductions  prepayments or repricing opportunities

management s evaluation of this risk is ultimately reflected in the company s financial statements by the level of the reserve for possible loan losses  and changes in this ongoing evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense 
the company maintains the reserve for possible loan loss at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb potential losses in the portfolio 
the factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of the reserve include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic conditions  credit reviews of individual loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  growth in the loan portfolio  composition of the loan portfolio  and past due and non accruing loans

at december   loans internally classified as having above normal credit risk totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million at year end classified loans were approximately of total loans at the end of both and  up from an historically low level of of total loans at december  the net increase from year end is primarily related to changes in the classifications of loans with five large commercial customers  each of which operates in a different industry 
the classification totals at december  were as follows loans as to which there are serious doubts as to full repayment  million  substandard loans with well defined weaknesses that  if not corrected  would likely result in some loss  million  and loans with risk characteristics that indicate potential weaknesses that warrant special attention  million 
management continually reviews the loan portfolio to identify potentially weak or deteriorating credits 
page of pages investment in securities total investment in securities was billion at december   compared to billion at year end the average total investment portfolio was billion in  compared to billion in  an increase of million 
between these same periods  average federal funds sold and other short term liquidity management investments decreased million 
this shift away from short term investments and into longer term investments took place as the yield difference between these types of investments improved after compressing during the latter part of the weighted average taxable equivalent portfolio yield was at december   a decrease of basis points from at december   reflecting mainly maturities and calls of older higher yielding securities 
at december   the weighted average yield on securities maturing within one year had been 
substantially all of the securities in the investment portfolio bear fixed interest rates

d these securities are classified as available for sale before maturity 
the actual timing of any potential sales  however  is not determinable at year end 
during  the company began building its investment in securities classified as available for sale  primarily as a means to increase liquidity management flexibility 
such securities constituted of the total investment portfolio at the end of  compared to at the end of these securities are reported at estimated fair market value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities was million at year end and 
million at s year end 
these unrealized losses are recognized  net of tax  in other comprehensive income and in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
page of pages securities that the bank positively intends and has the ability to hold to maturity continued to constitute the bulk of the investment portfolio 
these securities are carried at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
the bank does not normally maintain a securities trading portfolio 
occasionally  immaterial amounts of trading account securities are held for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the bank held no investment in securities of a single issuer  other than us treasury and us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies  that exceeded of its shareholders equity 
the bank has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
such instruments would include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  interest rate swap agreements and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
these financial instruments or agreements are commonly referred to as derivatives 
management continues to evaluate whether to use deriviatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
deposits and short term borrowings deposits were billion at december  and billion at year end average deposits were billion in  a million  or  increase over growth was registered in all deposit categories  with the exception of traditional savings account deposits 
the most significant growth continued to come from the promotion of bundled banking services  such as the bank s whitney select package  that include a premium money market account product 
total money market deposits increased million  or  in and  as is shown in table  represented approximately of total average deposits compared to in total time deposits  which are primarily certificates of deposit  rose in and were a relatively stable of total deposits 
table shows the maturities of time deposits at december  the bank continued to show growth in non interest bearing demand deposits  with an increase of million  or  on average over average non interest bearing deposits were of average total deposits during both and deposits acquired with the lake charles branches in september contributed million to the overall increase in average deposits in and represented a significant portion of the growth in average now account deposits and time deposits 
table average deposits dollars in thousands non interest bearing demand deposits    now account deposits    money market deposits    savings deposits    other time deposits    time deposits  and over    total average deposits    page of pages table maturities of time deposits dollars in thousands remaining maturity of time deposits of  or more as of december  three months or less  over three months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits of  or more  remaining maturity of time deposits of less than  as of december  three months or less  over three months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits of less than   total time deposit  short term borrowings consist of purchases of federal funds and sales of securities under repurchase agreements and were million at december  these short term borrowings largely represent transactions with customers  but also include million in brokered funds at year end which were acquired in part to support the build up of liquidity in connection with the bank s year contingency plan 
average short term borrowings in were million  including only million in average brokered funds 
this is a million  or  increase over substantially all of this increase can be attributed to higher demand for the bank s sweep repurchase product  which reflects in part the growth in commercial customer relationships and the underlying economic strength of the company s market areas 
liquidity the object of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
liquidity is provided by a stable base of funding sources  including low cost core deposits  and an adequate level of maturing assets 
the company models liquidity needs on a periodic basis to determine the best strategy of investments and borrowings to meet those needs 
the bank had over billion in unfunded loan commitments outstanding at december   an increase of million from s year end 
note shows the details of these and other unfunded commitments at december  and because loan commitments may  and many times do  expire without being drawn upon  unfunded balances do not represent actual future liquidity requirements 
to ensure adequate liquidity  the company has developed an investment strategy which plans a level of investment maturities that management considers adequate to meet funding needs 
in addition  the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level 
as mentioned earlier  the bank also began building its investment in securities classified as available for sale 
this process will further increase liquidity management flexibility 
the company s efforts to mitigate risks associated with the year problem are discussed below in the section on year remediation 
one of the uncertainties that was addressed in preparing for the date change to a new century was the potential for increased demand for currency 
the bank forecast this demand and implemented a plan to obtain and distribute additional cash supplies throughout its delivery system 
actual demand was well below initial forecasts as is evidenced by the increase in non interest bearing cash balances in the consolidated balance sheets at year end the costs of holding cash reserves above normal levels and the direct costs of increased distribution and security services were not significant 
page of pages asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company and the bank obtain measures of their interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations  monitoring the economic value of equity  and preparing gap analyses 
the simplest method of measuring interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis  which identifies the difference between the dollar volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within specified time periods 
gap analysis has several limitations  including the fact that it is a point in time measurement 
table  shows the company s static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity by maturity or repricing dates at december  after non interest dollars in millions days days days days year bearing total assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity  loans   federal funds sold and short term investments other assets total assets   sources of funds now account deposits money market deposits savings deposits other time deposits time deposits  and over short term borrowings non interest bearing demand deposits   other liabilities shareholders equity total sources of funds    interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total earning assets table indicates that the company is liability sensitive 
however  static gap does not take into consideration the actions that management intends to take to maximize net interest income over time 
the assets and liabilities of the company are constantly managed to limit changes in earnings because of changes in interest rates 
a more sophisticated tool used by the company to evaluate its interest rate sensitivity is a net interest income simulation model  which tests the bank s reaction to various economic environments 
the model s assumptions incorporate management s expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
in general  the simulations indicate that the company is moderately liability sensitive 
balance sheet and net interest income simulations were run at year end to determine the impact of various rate scenarios on net interest income for the next twelve month period 
a base case scenario used a rate forecast which showed an increase in key rates during totaling basis points 
the results of this simulation showed an increase in net interest income te of approximately million  or  from levels after consideration of projected asset and liability volumes 
when the simulations were subjected to parallel up and down instantaneous rate shocks of to basis points  the model showed an annual impact on the company s net interest income te from a negative million at page of pages basis points up to a positive million at basis points down 
the results of these simulations showed that the bank was within acceptable limits  considering established internal guidelines 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock simulation 
the actual impact of changing interest rates on net interest income is dependent on many factors including the growth of earning assets  the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
note contains information regarding these fair values 
the differences between fair values and book values were primarily the result of differences between contractual and market interest rates at each year end 
fluctuations in fair values will occur as interest rates change 
impact of inflation and changing prices the great majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflationary or deflationary economic cycles on the company s financial results is its ability to react to changes in interest rates 
interest rates do not  however  necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed above  management attempts to maintain a balance in its maturity and repricing structure to minimize the effects of economic cycles on the company s net interest income 
inflation and changing prices also have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
changing prices will also affect the trend in non interest operating expenses and non interest income 
capital adequacy the company remained strongly capitalized at december  as part of the effort to effectively manage its capital position  the company executed a stock repurchase program during  acquiring one million shares  or approximately  of its common stock for million 
the company will consider similar programs in the future as appropriate opportunities arise 
this stock repurchase program and the continued increase in total and risk weighted assets  mainly through loan growth  contributed to the decrease in the company s capital ratios in as shown in table because intangible assets generally must be deducted to determine regulatory capital and are excluded from risk weighted assets  the increase in intangible assets by approximately million in from the pending acquisition of bank of houston will tend to further reduce the company s regulatory capital ratios

page of pages year remediation for over two years the company and others within and outside the banking industry worked diligently to address the risks posed by the year problem 
this situation came about because many existing computer programs used only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
this raised the strong possibility that date recognition problems would cause processing errors as we entered the year the apparent success of these efforts has been widely publicized 
when the company began processing in the new century it experienced only a few date related problems and suffered no disruptions to its operations 
critical services  such as utilities and communication lines  were all available 
this also appears to have been the case with major customers and suppliers  although the bank continues to monitor significant borrowers for any operational problems that would not have become immediately apparent in the new year 
while it is possible that year problems will still occur  for example in the operations of a system or a process that has not yet been activated in  all mission critical information processing systems and operationally significant non information systems that employ embedded information technology are running normally 
all new systems will be thoroughly tested for their ability to operate in the year and beyond before going into production 
costs associated with the company s year remediation efforts included both internal costs  primarily personnel related  and costs from using outside consultants  both of which have been expensed 
non interest expense for included internal costs estimated at million and external costs totaling approximately 
million 
in  these costs were million and million  respectively 
there was no significant expense related to year remediation efforts in the company does not anticipate significant additional costs for the majority of the costs to remediate the company s systems were borne by third party vendors who supply software under annual maintenance fees 
results of operations net interest income net interest income te increased million in from the prior year  following an million increase in over the percentage increase was in each period 
loan growth was the major factor behind these improvements coupled with the company s ability to maintain its mix of interest bearing and interest free funding sources over these periods and effectively manage its cost of funds 
the net interest margin  which is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets  decreased to in from in and in tables and show the factors contributing to these changes and the components of these changes 
the mix of earning assets has shown continued improvement in recent years 
average loans grew in both and  outpacing the growth in average earning assets of in and in as a percent of earning assets  average loans increased to in from in and in the effective loan yield te has declined over this three year period reflecting in part the trend in market rates over this timeframe 
the company s effective loan yield te decreased basis points between and  following a decrease of basis points between and approximately of the value of the loan portfolio at year end is subject to repricing within one year  which is consistent with the percentage at year end s loan growth was funded mainly by increases in deposits and short term borrowings 
in  the company funded its loan growth mainly through reductions in the securities portfolio and steady deposit growth 
the average securities portfolio decreased by in  although a portion of this decline was caused by a shift to short term liquidity management investments in response to a flattening yield curve in the latter part of that year 
average securities were approximately of average earning assets in both and  down from in the basis point decrease in the effective investment portfolio yield te between and generally reflects the lower average reinvestment rates available in as noted above  growth in average deposits supported average earning asset growth in both and average non interest demand deposits grew in and in average interest bearing deposits grew in and in traditional savings deposits has been the only interest bearing deposit category with consistent decreases in recent years

page of pages provision for possible loan losses as was anticipated at the end of  the company began providing for possible loan losses in  after a nominal provision from a pooled acquisition in and a million reserve reduction in the million provision in exceeded net charge offs by million 
this reflects management s consideration  among other factors  of sustained strong loan growth and an increase in performing loans internally classified as having above normal credit risk 
with continued loan growth it is likely that additional provisions will be required in  although the size of these provisions will reflect asset quality trends and management s ongoing evaluation  based on established internal policies and practices  of the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio

non interest income table shows the components of non interest income for each of the three years ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component

income from service charges on deposit accounts increased in after an increase of in revised fee structures for certain deposit services made a significant contribution to the improvement in  as did the overall growth in fee based deposit accounts and transaction volume 
the lower increase from to reflects increased deposit business and the assimilation of acquisitions to whitney s rate schedules  somewhat offset by the migration of customers to whitney select and other products offering bundled services and lower service charges 
credit card income  the second largest component of non interest income  grew in after increasing in the customer base for merchant processing services continued to expand through successful sales efforts across the company s market areas  and retail transaction volumes have benefited from healthy local economies 
in both and  the company expanded the distribution of its debit card product  and the increasing acceptance and use of these cards for retail transactions has been a significant source of growth in the credit card income category 
page of pages trust service fees grew in and in marketing and incentive based sales efforts across all market areas again played an important role in building the customer base in the growth in trust service fees in recent years was also supported by the strong performance of the financial markets over much of this period 
atm fees increased in compared to in during  the absence of mergers and significant branch expansion activity and a reduced supply of economically attractive non branch remote sites caused a significant slowdown in the expansion of the company s network of full service atm s and cash dispensers 
this is reflected in the slower rate of growth in this income category for at december   and the company had  and atms and cash dispensers in service  respectively 
fees from secondary mortgage market operations grew strongly in both and as favorable interest rates and increased mortgage product emphasis and marketing produced higher origination volumes 
as expected  however  origination volumes and fees have fallen off in the latter part of with the recent upswing in market rates  and this will likely continue into the first part of late in the second quarter of  the company opened a new parking facility next to its main office 
the operating revenue from this facility totaled 
million and accounts for almost all of the increase in in the other operating income category 
the decrease in this income category between and reflects certain non recurring items in the earlier year 
net gains on sales and other dispositions of foreclosed assets include income from sales of pre assets that vary from year to year as opportunities for sales arise
