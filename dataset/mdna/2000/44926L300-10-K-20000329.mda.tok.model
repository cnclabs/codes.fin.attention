see recent developments 
the company s primary source of liquidity during the year was the operation of the restaurants owned by its principal operating subsidiaries  sybra and lyon s  and debt and lease financing 
in the future  the company s liquidity and capital resources will primarily depend on the operations of sybra and lyon s which  under the provisions of the company s loan agreements  would permit  under certain conditions  distributions and dividends to the company 
sybra and lyon s  like most restaurant businesses  are able to operate with nominal or deficit working capital because all sales are for cash and inventory turnover is rapid 
renovation and or remodeling of existing restaurants is either funded directly from available cash or  in some instances  is financed through outside lenders 
construction or acquisition of new restaurants is generally  although not always  financed by outside lenders 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to secure adequate financing on acceptable terms for new restaurant construction and acquisitions and that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given
