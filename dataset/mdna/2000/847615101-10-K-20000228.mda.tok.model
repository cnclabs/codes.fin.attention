quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of the company s european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in german deutsche marks  british pounds  and other local currencies 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the company s operating results and cash flow

the company has completed all the necessary enhancements to its sales order  banking arrangements and operational procedures to ensure euro compliance

the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the company s operations

the company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
however  the company continuously monitors operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in the company s manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company passes increased costs on to its customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales increases reported in the accompanying financial statements  however  have substantially arisen from increased sales volume  not increases in selling prices 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involved four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
in  the company completed its assessment of all material systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected 
the assessment also indicated that software used in certain manufacturing equipment hereafter referred to as operating equipment was also at risk 
for its information technology exposures  the company completed the remediation phase for all material systems in february  including required software reprogramming and replacement 
in august  the company completed all of its testing and fully implemented its remediated systems 
with respect to operating equipment  the company completed the remediation phase of the resolution process in february testing and implementation of all affected equipment was completed by september to date  the company has not experienced any year problems with its information systems or operating equipment 
in  the company queried its important suppliers and vendors to assess their year readiness 
to date  the company is not aware of any problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these suppliers and vendors are year ready 
the inability of those parties to complete their year resolution process could materially impact the company 
in addition  the company does not have a comprehensive contingency plan with respect to the year issue 
the company used both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
total year project costs were not material 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
the company expects to adopt the new statement effective december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
