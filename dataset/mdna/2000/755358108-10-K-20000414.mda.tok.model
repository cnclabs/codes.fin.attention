item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company is principally in the business of developing and operating multiplex cinemas in australia  new zealand  the united states and puerto rico  and in developing cinema based entertainment centers in australia and new zealand 
during and  the company has invested substantially all of its liquid assets in cinemas and in land held for development as entertainment centers  principally in the australian and new zealand markets 
in and  the company opened or acquired  directly or indirectly through joint ventures  twenty nine after consideration of six closed screens and seventy eight screens  respectively 
currently  the company has  directly or through joint ventures  seventy one screens in ten cinema complexes in australia  thirteen screens in three cinema complexes in new zealand  fifty six screens in eight cinema complexes in puerto rico and forty two screens in six cinema complexes in the united states 
since most of the screens added in were opened late in the year  neither their revenues or expenses are fully reflected in the company s results of operations 
also  it is anticipated that the costs of operation for these new cinemas will be higher during their initial periods of operation than on a normalized basis  due to the higher staffing and advertising costs typically associated with a new cinema 
going forward  the company has determined to focus its efforts on the australian and new zealand markets 
the company opened an eight screen complex in australia in march and anticipates opening an additional ten screen complex in australia in the third quarter of at the present time  the company has no plans to expand its puerto rican circuit and plans to open only a single additional cinema in the united states in ultimately  the company intends to phase out of the exhibition business domestically and in puerto rico 
in april  the company sold a interest in the ny angelika to national auto credit  inc and granted nac options to i acquire the company s remaining interest in the ny angelika and ii to acquire the company s remaining domestic cinemas and the company s rights under the agreement in principle to the city cinemas transaction 
citadel is also in discussions with the company concerning the obi transaction and the city cinemas transaction 
see item business  general 
generally speaking  the film exhibition industry in the united states and puerto rico has suffered from the overbuilding of multiplex cinemas 
fortunately  overbuilding is not currently  in the view of the company  a problem in australia or new zealand 
in  the company took writedowns of approximately million 
of this  approximately  relates to the impairment of the company s domestic and puerto rican cinema assets 
the impairment relating to puerto rico  was the result of the opening and anticipated opening of competitive cinemas by the dominant exhibitor in that market  including a new thirteen screen cinema to be opened at the plaza las americas mall  in direct competition to an eightplex cinema currently operated by the company in that same shopping center and the company s subsequent decision to exit the puerto rico cinema market 
the writedown with respect to the company s domestic cinema operations relates to the impairment of two domestic cinemas  which fell victim to overbuilding by competitors 
in addition  the company reduced its estimate of the residual value of certain computer equipment held for lease by the company resulting in an impairment loss of million 
the company is currently in the process of consolidating its general and administrative functions in los angeles and closing its executive headquarters in philadelphia 
the executive offices of the company s affiliates  craig and citadel  are also located in los angeles  and it is anticipated that certain economies can be achieved if the general and administrative functions of these three companies are consolidated 
accordingly  on a going forward basis  the domestic general and administrative functions of the company  craig and citadel will be performed principally by employees of craig 
the cost of such functions will be shared on an appropriate basis between the company  craig and citadel 
as the relative demands of the company  craig and citadel will likely vary from year to year  it is currently expected that this allocation will be reviewed by the participants on a periodic basis  as appropriate from time to time 
results of operations due to the nature of the company s development and acquisition activities and the timing associated with the results of such activities  the timing of new cinema openings and acquisitions and the long term nature of the company s real estate development activities  historical revenues and earnings have varied significantly 
none of the company s entertainment center developments have commenced full operations and several are in the early stage of development 
accordingly  general and administrative expenses related to such real estate development activities have not been supported by operating income 
the cinema at one of the company s six entertainment center projects was placed in service in december  however  the entertainment related retail space is not expected to be placed in operation until mid a second entertainment center project which includes a ten screen cinema  commenced construction during and is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of during  the company opened nine new cinemas with a total of seventy eight screens  four of which cinemas representing forty four screens commenced operation in december due to the varying pace of development activities and the timing of new cinema openings  management believes that historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the financial performance and results of operations of the company may be affected by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
historically the company maintained most of its cash and cash equivalent balances in eurodollar time deposits us dollar denominated deposits in banks located outside of the united states and short term money market instruments with original maturities of six months or less 
eurodollar time deposits are not readily marketable and therefore are not subject to price risk due to changes in interest rates  although the company may lose the ability to realize the benefit of increased interest income if interest rates were to rise 
other money market investments are subject to price risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short term nature of such investments and the small amount of the company s cash and cash equivalents invested in such instruments  a change of in short term interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
the company anticipates expenditure of its remaining cash balances during thereafter  the company anticipates funding its commitments with borrowed funds and cash flow 
the company may  from time to time  elect to fix interest rates on borrowed funds  however  no decision has been made at this time

such borrowing will be originated in the same currencies as the expenditures 
accordingly  unless the company elects to hedge its foreign exchange exposure  approximately of the company s net assets based upon the amount at december  will continue to be invested in assets subject to exchange fluctuations between the us and australian and new zealand dollars 
at december  approximately of the company s net assets were invested in assets subject to currency fluctuations 
the company has no current plan to hedge such exposure 
during  the company recognized an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of approximately  included as a component of comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity contained elsewhere herein compared to an unrealized loss of  during the unrealized gain recognized in related primarily to an increase in the value of the australian and new zealand dollars relative to the us dollar of approximately and between december  and december   respectively  and the corresponding effect upon the carrying value of reading australia s and reading new zealand s assets 
the unrealized loss during related primarily to a decrease in the value of the australian dollar relative to the us dollar of approximately between december  and december   and the corresponding effect upon the carrying value of reading australia s assets 
since foreign dollar income is minimal as most of the company s projects are under development  the impact upon income from operations of fluctuations in the relative value of the us  the australian and new zealand dollars was not material in  or
