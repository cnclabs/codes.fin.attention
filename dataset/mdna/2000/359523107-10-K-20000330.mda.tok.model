proforma for the years ended december amounts in thousands of us dollars net revenues    costs and expenses cost of sales    selling  general and administrative    research and development   operating income loss    loss from equity interest in affiliate interest expense other expense income  net income loss before minority interest and taxes    less minority interest in nft income loss before income taxes    income tax expense   net income loss   versus the company operates primarily in the air pollution control business 
it distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
principal markets for its products are stationary combustion sources that produce nitrogen oxide nox and other emissions 
the company sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  an increase of 
the increase primarily represents a  increase in domestic nox project revenue and a  increase in asian pollution control revenue 
the gains were marginally offset by a decline in the domestic fuel treatment chemical business 
the domestic nox increase is due to the substantial increase in utility industry air pollution control project revenue caused  in part  by phase ii of title i of the clean air act amendments of caaa 
the federal mandate to further reduce nox in states by may  the sip call  also contributed to record revenues even though the decision on implementation was not yet clear 
however  on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states  which is expected to significantly increase nox control project revenues during the next several years  once the partial stay of the sip call is lifted 
the increase in asian revenue is the direct result of one large contract at a korean utility 
asian revenues in are expected to decrease from the level 
however  excluding the one time utility contract in korea  asian revenues are expected to increase from historical levels from both nox project and fuel treatment chemical sales 
the decline in domestic fuel treatment chemical sales is tied directly to the increased market price for fuel oil 
as the price of fuel oil has increased  customers have switched fuels to natural gas 
revenues in this market in the year will be dependent upon this market driver  as well as the company s ability to obtain non fuel oil dependent business 
in the year  the company is directing its sales and marketing efforts toward the proliferation of its patented targeted in furnace injection technology for the segments of the market that are not dependent on commodity pricing 
examples of these market segments are the pulp and paper industry  municipal solid waste facilities and other solid fuel fired units 
gross margin percentages were in compared with in the slight decline in margin percentage was due primarily to the impact of low margin air pollution control projects in europe in  which were driven by a heavily competitive marketplace 
when excluding this factor  the gross margin on air pollution control revenues as a whole remained relatively flat year on year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased  from due predominantly to selling expenses from accelerated business activity

the cdt common and preferred stock have no carrying value in the company s balance sheets as of december  and interest expense increased by  from the increase was due to the financing required to satisfy the contingent obligation due to nalco as part of the company s purchase of nalco s share of nft

the company recorded million of income tax expense in versus million in the company has million in us federal income tax loss carryforwards the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in the company s balance sheet

there will  therefore  be wide variations in the level of control and the timing of regulations by states 
the company s implementor strategy will enable the company to provide the noxout process to an increasing number of customers without significantly adding technical and support staff

versus net sales in totaled  versus proforma net sales of  in  an increase of 
the increase primarily represents an  increase in domestic nox project revenue  partially offset by a  decrease in asian air pollution control project revenue and a  decline in international fuel treatment chemical sales 
the domestic increase is primarily the result of increased utility industry revenue caused  in part  by phase ii of title i of the caaa 
the decline in revenue in asia is the result of fewer bookings in than the decline in international fuel treatment chemical sales is the result of a significant customer ceasing treatment of its fuel oil  whether it will use fuel tech products in the future is uncertain 
gross margin percentages were in compared with proforma in gross margin percentage improved because most of the losses recorded on nft s soxout cascade project in poland occurred in gross margins on air pollution control projects increased percentage points  largely the result of favorable changes in customer mix in selling  general and administrative costs decreased  from proforma the decrease was primarily due to a substantial reduction in polish administrative costs between and  costs incurred in related to the closing of the company s offices in the united kingdom and taiwan and reduced commissions on international fuel treatment chemical sales

the company uses interest rate derivative instruments an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap transaction that fixes the rate of interest at on approximately of the outstanding principal balance during the term of the loan 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
