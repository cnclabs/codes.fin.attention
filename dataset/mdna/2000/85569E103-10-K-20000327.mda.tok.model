overview startec global communications corporation is a rapidly growing  facilities based provider of integrated communications services  including voice  data and internet access services 
founded in  we market our services to select ethnic residential communities located in major metropolitan areas  and to leading international long distance carriers 
we provide our services through a flexible network of owned and leased facilities  operating and termination agreements and resale arrangements 
additionally in  we embarked upon three internet initiatives i internet access for residential customers  ii global ethnic web communities  and iii the deployment of a world class internet protocol ip network to offer our customers toll quality voice services  as well as high speed transmission of data and internet traffic 
our mission is to become the leading provider of voice  data and internet services to select ethnic communities  located in major metropolitan areas in north america  europe and the asia pacific rim 
our targeted ethnic markets  comprised of ethnic communities from the asia pacific rim  the middle east and north africa  russia and central europe and latin and south america  have a strong demand for communication services to the emerging economies 
to achieve our mission  we have developed three core competencies i targeted ethnic marketing and in language customer service  ii deployment of advanced technologies into the emerging economies  and iii deployment of ip transaction based technology to provide voice  data and internet services on a seamless network 
in  we transmitted approximately one billion minutes of voice traffic into the emerging economies 
our annual revenues have increased more than twenty six fold over the last five years from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  we reported a net loss of million  or per common share compared to a net loss of million  or per common share in the number of our residential customers increased from  customers as of december  to  customers as of december  to achieve economies of scale in our network operations and balance our residential international traffic  in late  we began marketing our excess network capacity to international carriers seeking competitive rates and high quality capacity 
since initiating our international wholesale services  we have expanded the number of our carrier customers to at december  for the year ended december   carrier customers accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
during  we began to capitalize on our strong presence in ethnic communities by expanding the services we offer 
our strategy is to facilitate our continued expansion into emerging economies by expanding our telecommunications and internet services for our residential customers 
in  we introduced a bundled long distance internet access service for our dial customers who bill a month or more in long distance 
to complement our internet access services  we began launching a series of global ethnic web communities through our online brand  estart 
to date  we have launched four communities for the arab  iranian  turkish and indian ethnic segments 
each community features news  entertainment  weather and sports that are culturally tailored 
additionally  the communities feature online discussion forums  topic based chat rooms and communication tools 
all the communities are linked by a single entry gateway page that allows user to customize the content according to their preferences 
we are building a state of the art network using a combination of internet protocol  asynchronous transfer mode atm and circuit switched technologies to provide connectivity to the emerging economies of the world  allowing us to integrate voice  data  internet and video services on a seamless network supported by a backbone of scalable  ip transaction based technology 
our network currently consists of eight domestic and international switches  points of presence installations of scalable telecommunications equipment  commonly known as pops  ip gateways and ownership interests on undersea fiber optic cable systems linking north america with europe  the asian pacific rim  asia and latin america  as well as linking the east and west coasts of the united states 
our network includes major switching centers in new york  los angeles  miami  paris  london  dusseldorf and guam 
to facilitate the termination of calls overseas  we are a party to interconnection agreements with incumbent local carriers in foreign countries  commonly known as ptts  and other competitive carriers covering countries  primarily in the emerging economies 
a large majority of our revenues for the past three fiscal years have been derived from calls originated within the united states and terminated outside the united states 
the percentages of net revenues attributable to traffic terminating on a region by region basis are set forth in the table below 
for the year ended december  asia pacific rim middle east north africa sub saharan africa eastern europe western europe north america south america and other total our cost of services consists of origination  transmission and termination expenses 
origination costs include the amounts paid to lecs  and in areas where we do not have our own network facilities  to other telecommunication network providers for originating calls ultimately carried to our switches 
transmission expenses are fixed month to month payments associated with capacity on domestic and international leased lines  satellites and undersea fiber optic cables 
leasing this capacity subjects us to price changes that are beyond our control and to transmission costs that are higher than transmission costs on the company s own network 
as we build our own transmission capacity  the risks associated with price fluctuations and the relative costs of transmission are expected to decrease  however  fixed costs will increase 
termination expenses consist of variable per minute charges paid to foreign ptts and alternative carriers to terminate our international long distance traffic 
among our various foreign termination arrangements  we have entered into operating agreements with a number of foreign ptts  under which international long distance traffic is both delivered and received 
under these agreements  the foreign carriers are contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the fcc  whereby traffic from the foreign country to the united states is routed through us based international carriers such as the company in the same proportion as traffic carried into the foreign country from the united states return traffic 
mutually exchanged traffic between us and foreign carriers is reconciled through a formal settlement arrangement at agreed upon rates 
we record the amount due to the foreign ptt as an expense in the period the traffic is terminated 
when we receive return traffic in a future period  we generally realize a higher gross margin on the return traffic as compared to the lower gross margin on the outbound traffic 
revenue recognized from return traffic was approximately  million  and million  or  and of net revenues in    respectively 
there can be no assurance that traffic will be delivered back to the united states or that changes in future settlement rates  allocations among carriers or levels of traffic will not adversely affect net payments received and revenues recorded by us 
in addition to operating agreements  we utilize alternative termination arrangements offered by third party vendors 
we seek to maintain vendor diversity for countries where traffic volume is high 
these vendor arrangements provide service on a variable cost basis subject to volume 
these prices are subject to changes  generally upon seven days notice 
as the international telecommunications marketplace has been deregulated  per minute prices have fallen and  as a consequence  related per minute costs for these services have also fallen 
as a result  we have not been adversely affected by price reductions  although there can be no assurance that this will continue 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs to increase as we develop our infrastructure to manage higher business volume 
although north american operations became ebitda positive for the fourth quarter of and are expected to remain ebitda positive in  our other segments will remain ebitda negative and incur significant operating and net losses on an annual basis for the next several years 
this will be the result of additional costs associated with the development and expansion of our network  the expansion of our marketing programs  as we enter new markets and introduce new telecommunications and internet services  and  in the case of net losses  as a result of the interest expense associated with our financing activities 
accordingly  we expect to continue to report net losses and negative ebitda on a consolidated basis for the foreseeable future

our business strategy contemplates aggregate capital expenditures including capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes of approximately million through december  to be spent on our internet infrastructure 
a substantial portion of these expenditures are funded by existing vendor arrangements 
we are also pursuing additional sources of financing from the capital markets to raise between and million 
we intend to use any additional sources of financing to fund our acquisition activities 
these activities include  but are not limited to  integration expenses  internet infrastructure and other post acquisition related expenditures 
we regularly review opportunities to further our business strategy through strategic alliances with  investment in  or acquisitions of businesses that we believe are complementary to our current and planned operations 
our ability to consummate strategic alliances and acquisitions  and to make investments that may be of strategic significance  may require us to obtain additional debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in arranging such financing on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
although we intend to implement the capital spending plan described above  it is possible that unanticipated business opportunities may arise which we may conclude are more favorable to our long term prospects than those contemplated by the current capital spending plan 
capital transactions in december  we issued  shares of voting common stock for net proceeds of million through a private placement 
the shares were subsequently registered in january in july  we entered into a three year vendor financing facility for up to million with ibm credit corp ibm facility 
the ibm facility may be used to finance the purchase of ibm hardware and software under a capital lease structure 
the ibm facility bears interest at a variable rate during the term of the lease 
as of december   approximately  bearing a weighted average interest rate of was outstanding under the facility 
in june  we entered into a three year loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation cfc facility  a subsidiary of first union bank for up to million 
the cfc facility  secured by trade accounts receivable may be used to finance equipment  undersea cables and the expansion of our facilities 
the cfc facility bears interest at the prime rate effective on the date of borrowing 
principal and interest on the cfc facility are repaid through collections from trade accounts receivable 
there is an unused line fee equal to 
per annum calculated upon the amount the maximum credit exceeds the average daily balance of borrowed amounts during the immediately preceding month payable monthly in arrears 
as of december   approximately million bearing interest at was outstanding under the facility 
in may  we entered into a vendor financing facility for up to million with ascend credit corporation ascend facility

the line of credit is flexible and may be used to finance switches  associated telecommunications equipment  undersea fiber optic cables  and the expansion of facilities of our targeted marketing areas 
each borrowing under the ntfc facility bears interest at a fixed rate equal to the average yield to maturity of the five year treasury note plus the rate adjustment as defined in the agreement 
individual borrowings under the ntfc facility are amortized over months from the date of advance with a final maturity of all outstanding amounts of january as of december   approximately million bearing a weighted average interest rate of was outstanding 
principal and interest payments of approximately  are due monthly in arrears 
after taking into account the net proceeds to startec from the open vendor financing agreements together with the cash on hand and anticipated cash from operations  we expect that we will need additional financing to complete our capital spending plan until early although we believe that we should be able to obtain this required financing from traditional sources  such as bank lenders  asset based financiers or equipment vendors  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in arranging such financing on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing  we will be required to limit or curtail our expansion plans 
even with such reductions  management believes that new financing will be required by no later than the end of the implementation of our strategic plans  including the development and expansion of our network facilities  expansion of our marketing programs  and funding of operating losses and working capital needs  will require significant investment 
there can be no assurance that we will not need additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
the need for additional financing depends on a variety of factors  including the rate and extent of our expansion and new markets  the cost of an investment in additional switching and transmission facilities and ownership rights in fiber optic cable  the incurrence of costs to support the introduction of additional or enhanced services  and increased sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  we may need additional financing to fund unanticipated working capital needs or to take advantage of unanticipated business opportunities  including acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances 
the amount of our actual future capital requirements also will depend upon many factors that are not within our control  including competitive conditions and regulatory or other government actions 
in the event that our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or our capital resources prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  then some or all of our development and expansion plans could be delayed or abandoned  or we may be required to seek additional financing or to sell assets  to the extent permitted by the terms of the senior notes 
we may seek to raise such additional capital from public or private equity or debt sources 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or  if obtained  that it will be able to do so on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
if we are able to raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  it would likely become subject to additional restrictive financial covenants 
in the event that we are unable to obtain such additional capital or are unable to obtain such additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our expansion  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  our ability to compete and our ability to meet our obligations under the senior notes 
cash flows our liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities  purchases of network equipment and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  net cash used by operating activities was approximately million for  million for  and million for the decrease in cash from operations was primarily the result of the net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for was primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures made in connection with its telecommunication network expansion 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for primarily resulted from the proceeds from vendor and bank financing agreements and proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through a private placement 
effects of inflation inflation is not a material factor affecting our business and has not had a significant effect on our operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market and technology risk  including changes in interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates as well as network sabotage 
we do not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes 
we believe that our primary market risk exposure relates the effects that changes in interest rates have on our investments and those portions of our outstanding indebtedness that do not have fixed rates of interest 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our investments in cash equivalents  which consist primarily of demand deposits and money market accounts  and us government obligations which have been purchased by the company and pledged to make certain interest payments on the senior notes 
in addition  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our long term debt obligations including the senior notes 
as of december   the fair value of the senior notes was approximately million and the fair value of the securities pledged to make certain interest payments on the senior notes was approximately million 
changes in interest rates also affect our borrowings under our vendor financing facilities with ntfc and ibm 
borrowings under the ntfc facility bear interest at a fixed rate equal to the average yield to maturity of the five year treasury note plus an agreed upon rate adjustment 
borrowings under the ibm facility bears a weighted average interest rate of and ntfc bears interest rates ranging from to 
our foreign operations to date have not been significant  and  therefore any foreign exchange rate fluctuations relating to our results of foreign operations have also not been material 
for  we experienced a translation adjustment of approximately  relating to net assets held in foreign subsidiaries 
we have not entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts or other derivative arrangements to manage risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations exposure may increase in the future as the size and scope of our foreign operations increases 
additional information relating to the fair value of certain of our financial assets and liabilities is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our primary technology risk is the unauthorized entry into our network systems and disruption of operations hacking 
we did not experience any unauthorized entries or disruptions in we have taken steps to prevent any hacking into our network  however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not be affected by potential attempts at disruption in the future 
during the year ended december   we completed a coordinated company wide review of each business unit to identify dependent systems and to evaluate the potential exposure to the yk issue 
we completed the upgrade and replacement of systems potentially exposed to the yk issue 
we did not experience immediate adverse impact from the transition to the year however  we cannot provide assurance that we or our suppliers and customers have not been affected in a manner that is not yet apparent 
in addition  some computer programs that were date sensitive to the year may not have been programmed to process the year as a leap year  and any negative consequential effects remain unknown 
as a result  we will continue to monitor our year compliance and the year compliance of our suppliers and customers 
we estimate that the total cost of our yk program  including auditing and monitoring our vendors  inspecting our own systems and  where necessary  migrating or converting our existing systems to new systems  has been approximately million
