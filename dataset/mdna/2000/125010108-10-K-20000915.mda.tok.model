net sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year telecommunications equipment segment sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was attributable to sales growth in rf and fiber optics products as we continue to expand our product offering through development of new products  acquisitions and strategic partnerships to meet domestic and international customer demands 
bms segment sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to technical services performed in our customers plants  including system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification and system maintenance 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year telecommunications equipment segment sales increased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  as a result of increased capital spending by certain domestic cable operators for network transmission equipment 
bms segment sales increased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  due to increased technical services related to design  activation and support of hfc networks 
domestic sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this growth occurred in both telecommunication equipment and broadband management services sales 
a significant amount of consolidation and system swaps occurred among our domestic customer base over the past months 
following that activity  several of the resulting large multiple system operators mso s began upgrading the properties they had acquired and this translated into increased demand for our products and services 
domestic sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was principally in sales of telecommunications equipment  resulting from increased demand for network equipment by certain domestic mso s 
total domestic sales were of net sales for fiscal year  as compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
international sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this growth was principally in sales of telecommunications equipment and reflected the beginning of a network upgrade program by a major customer in canada and increased demand from customers in the europacific region 
international sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease resulted generally from a weakness in sales to all international markets  with the exception of asia  in fiscal year we expect international markets will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales base  but believe demand will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for hfc network distribution equipment can be impacted by a variety of factors including access to financing and general economic conditions 
our total international sales were of consolidated net sales in fiscal year  as compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
we are subject to certain risks as a result of market and customer concentration

gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year for the telecommunications equipment segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year in fiscal year  efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes enabled us to improve our absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs  and realize greater material cost reductions  as compared to fiscal year in addition  changes in product mix and ongoing efforts to improve manufacturing automation initiatives also contributed to the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal year  relative to fiscal year reductions in material costs  changes in customer and product mix  lower manufacturing costs resulting from our operation in mexico  efficiencies resulting from higher production volume and manufacturing automation initiatives  all contributed to the increase in the gross profit margin in fiscal year  relative to fiscal year for the bms segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year in fiscal year  gross margin for the bms segment declined relative to fiscal year due to increased costs associated with a ramp up of personnel and other infrastructure costs as the company expanded its technical services group 
gross margin for the bms segment increased in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  due to improved margins on products and services to manage high speed data  as well as technical customer services 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  million of net sales in fiscal year and million of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year was primarily due to the consolidation of certain positions and administrative functions  as a result of the mergers with convergence and svci 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was due primarily to personnel and other costs associated with expansion of our domestic sales force in conjunction with the introduction of new products and expanded offering of technical services related to design  activation and support of hfc networks 
we anticipate increasing selling and administrative expense in future periods  related to international expansion  although these expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  million of net sales in fiscal year and million of net sales in fiscal year the increase in research and product development expenditures in fiscal year resulted from higher personnel costs and additional expenses primarily for development of fiber optic transmission products  including transmitters  receivers  erbium doped fiber amplifiers and the continued development of network management products and capabilities 
the increase in research and product development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from higher personnel costs and additional expenses primarily for development of fiber optic and network management products 
we anticipate continuing increases in research and product development expenses in future periods  related to ongoing initiatives  although these expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
operating income loss by segment 
operating income excluding non recurring business combination costs for the telecommunications equipment segment in fiscal years  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating income for each year was attributable to increased volume and improvement in gross margins 
operating loss excluding non recurring business combination costs for the bms segment in fiscal years  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the losses derive primarily from increased investment and development costs associated with our network management products 
interest and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the decrease in interest expense in fiscal year resulted from reductions of long term debt and borrowings on various short term credit facilities  and a decrease in the amortization related to the fair market value of warrants issued in fiscal year in connection with certain debt financing arrangements by svci 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal year compared to resulted primarily from increased borrowings on various credit facilities and  of amortization related to the fair market value of warrants issued in connection with certain debt financing arrangements by svci

income taxes 
our overall effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  for fiscal year and for fiscal year the lower effective income tax rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from an adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to certain tax benefits from the acquisitions of convergence and svci  and was offset partially by permanent differences for non deductible business combination costs incurred in relation with the mergers with convergence  svci and worldbridge 
the higher effective income tax rate in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  resulted primarily from limited tax benefit from the operating losses at svci and convergence  reduced tax benefits from our foreign sales corporation and higher state income taxes 
in addition  fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period reflect other changes in permanent non deductible amounts  the relative profitability related to both us and us operations and differences in statutory rates 
we expect to have an effective annual tax rate that approximates statutory rates in the future 
results of discontinued operations on july   we announced the discontinuation of our digital fiber optics transmission products segment located in fremont  california 
we recorded gains on the disposal of the discontinued operations  net of tax  of million   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the gain on disposal of the discontinued business segment in fiscal year resulted primarily from settlement of certain litigation with a supplier

liquidity and capital resources in november  we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs of million 
as of june   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up from million at june  net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the million of cash provided by operations in fiscal year includes the effect of million of nonrecurring costs associated with the mergers completed during the year 
excluding these costs  the operations generated million in cash in fiscal year the increase in cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in net income for fiscal year  compared to a net loss in fiscal year  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities and other short term investments

in addition  we invested million in fortress technologies 
net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year resulted primarily from net proceeds received through a follow on public offering of our common stock 
our other financing activities consisted primarily of payments on short term and long term debt and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants 
we have a credit agreement with three banks under which we may borrow up to million 
under the credit agreement  million is available as a revolving line of credit  subject to an aggregate sub limit of million for issuance of letters of credit which is committed through november  the credit agreement also permits us to borrow up to million  for strategic acquisitions and or investments  which is also committed through november  credit pricing on these facilities is a function of our total funded indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at various rates  at our option  and are limited to three times ebitda 
borrowings on these facilities are unsecured  subject to a negative pledge on all business assets  and we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with indebtedness tests 
as of june   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  and based on fiscal year ebitda  the full million facility was available 
management believes that operating cash flow  proceeds received from the follow on public offering  as well as the aforementioned credit agreement  will be adequate to provide for all cash requirements for the foreseeable future  subject to requirements that strategic developments might dictate
