item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of net sales of items in the consolidated statement of income 
this financial information and the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended june  net sales costs and expenses intangibles amortization operating income net interest expense other income expense income before income taxes income taxes net income results of operations sales for fiscal year were billion  a increase over the billion in fiscal a continued shift in business mix towards communications end markets contributed to the improved operating margins and earnings per share  especially in the fourth quarter 
communications products represented approximately of fiscal fourth quarter sales  a previously declared goal of our product diversification strategy 
the expansion of business with nortel networks resulting from the acquisition in august of their brockville  canada plant and new nortel business for other sci plants aided this sales growth 
besides the nortel acquisition  we acquired the manufacturing assets of tag manufacturing  inc a us based enclosure company  and eci telecom s petah tikva  israel plant 
these acquisitions also contributed to fiscal s product diversification and sales growth 
pc finished product sales  which historically have a higher asset turnover to mitigate their lower operating margin  declined to of fiscal sales from the beginning of the year run rate of 
volume increases during fiscal offset a moderate decline in average selling prices  which abated during the year as component shortages arose 
fiscal sales were slightly less a decrease than the billion in fiscal market shifts and changeovers in customers products  together with lower average selling prices  accounted for the lower fiscal sales 
a majority of our revenue is generated by servicing multinational companies in various global manufacturing facilities 
international non us operation sales accounted for of fiscal sales  in fiscal and in fiscal sales are expected to continue to grow faster internationally than domestically  especially in mexico  canada and central europe 
international operations grew and us operations grew in fiscal  compared with domestic sales decline and international sales growth in fiscal the international operations growth is attributable to both organic growth and acquisitions 
accelerated expansion of international production capacity began in fiscal these expansions  together with the acquisition of certain scandinavian operations from nokia in late fiscal  and fiscal s acquisition of an ericsson telecom spanish facility and hewlett packard s verifone  inc china plant  and the aforementioned fiscal international acquisitions  generated the international sales growth over the last two fiscal years 
two of our mexican plants will enter a third expansion phase shortly 
mexico represents the fastest growing geographic area for us 
its low production costs and geographic proximity to us markets make it extremely attractive to our customers 
several major programs previously executed at our domestic facilities have been transferred to the mexican plants 
bookings for fiscal of billion were a record  reflecting business strength across a broad range of end markets  and giving rise to a backlog of billion  the highest level ever 
our current mix of business  backlog  and prospects for new business puts us in position for continued growth 
operating margins before amortization of intangibles improved to in fiscal from last fiscal year mainly as a page of result of the business mix shift and improved operating results in operations that were in a startup phase in fiscal such operations are quickly approaching full production capacity in existing facilities that were expanded during fiscal reduced losses  including currency exchange losses  at the brazilian plant also contributed to the improved operating margin 
fiscal s operating margins before amortization of intangibles declined from the in fiscal primarily as a result of transition and startup costs associated with new and enlarged facilities and projects  industry price pressures  and increased international currency exchange losses 
goodwill and contract intangible amortization increased to 
of sales in fiscal from less than 
in fiscal and this increase is attributable to the intangible assets arising from several acquisitions closed during fiscal and represents the results of an aggressive acquisition program that will continue in fiscal depreciation expense remained fairly consistent as a percent of sales in the last three fiscal years in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal 
the sales shift to higher margin lower turnover products  together with a tightening in the availability of certain components  led to lower asset turnovers in fiscal shortages and extended purchase lead times are currently being experienced on certain components 
also contributing to lower asset turnovers this fiscal year is higher capital intensity in the ems industry  caused by increased cost of current production equipment and increased acquisition activity 
capital expenditures increased significantly in fiscal net interest expense increased to 
of sales in fiscal from 
in fiscal as a result of increased borrowings and accounts receivables sold under the asset securitization program to fund revenue and asset growth 
interest expense may grow in the next fiscal year as debt increases to fund anticipated organic growth and acquisition activity 
net interest expense was 
of sales in fiscal fiscal s net interest expense declined from that in fiscal mainly because of lower borrowing requirements and the may conversion of outstanding convertible notes into common stock 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes  offset by lower taxed international earnings considered permanently reinvested abroad 
increased lower taxed international earnings accounted for the lower effective income tax rates in fiscal and fiscal capital resources and liquidity during fiscal  organic growth fueled working capital needs as well as capital expenditures for plant expansions  and capital was used for several acquisitions 
we expect organic growth and acquisitions to continue at a rapid pace  thus  access to the capital markets is very important to our continued growth and success 
we have taken several steps to ensure ready access to capital 
sci has an investment grade rating on its debt from both standard poor s and moody s 
as we grow  we intend to maintain or even improve that credit rating 
we filed an million universal shelf in january and pulled down million of the shelf in a successful convertible debenture offering in march 
during june  we renegotiated our two major bank facilities  increasing the amounts available and thus providing the financial capacity to handle future growth 
see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements  which are included under item cash was consumed in our operating activities in fiscal in the amount of million due to the need for working capital to support growth 
this compared to cash generated by operating activities of million in fiscal as growth slowed for a brief interval 
higher investing activity in fiscal required more use of cash than in the prior year 
we expanded our facilities to meet increasing demand and expanded our acquisition activities 
acquisitions completed during fiscal were nortel networks brockville  ontario  canada plant and certain other manufacturing assets in august  tag manufacturing  inc s operations in december  and eci telecom s shemer manufacturing plant in january other noncurrent assets cash usage increased because of investments in uniwill computer corporation and ehitex  and the acquisition of a noncurrent pension asset associated with the nortel acquisition 
fiscal capital expenditures including acquisition intangibles were million million in property  plant and equipment additions and million in other acquisition expenditures 
the company has an ongoing program of actively investigating business opportunities generated by other companies divestitures as well as acquisition of companies in related businesses  so cash needs are expected to be high again in fiscal fiscal acquisitions were funded using the convertible note issue in march and available liquidity 
page of available liquidity at june  was million  which consisted of million in unused credit facilities and million in cash and cash equivalents 
the company believes it can adequately fund its expected growth in the intermediate term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate fluctuations short term interest rate changes can impact our interest expense on our variable interest rate debt  as well as the discount reflected as interest expense on its accounts receivable sold under an asset securitization agreement 
outstanding variable interest rate debt and accounts receivable sold approximated million at june  a one half percentage point change in short term interest rates would have a current impact of increasing interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis 
changing interest rates could have a larger impact on future earnings if variable interest rate debt is used to finance acquisitions and growth beyond that currently projected 
presently  fixed rate debt is largely being used to finance our operations 
international currency exchange rates fluctuations we predominantly conduct our international sales and purchase transactions in us dollars or under customer contract provisions that protect against most major currency risks 
our largest currency risk is that associated with the brazilian operation 
unlike our other international operations  our brazilian plant is directly subjected to the effects of currency devaluation on certain customers contracts until forward pricing is adjusted accordingly normally monthly 
other currency exchange risks primarily relate to current assets and liabilities denominated in other than the us dollar 
although we endeavor to balance such items against each other where possible at individual operations  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in mitigating the effects of changes in currency exchange rates upon such international dollar transactions 
changes in some international currency exchange rates impact the geographic areas where our revenue is derived 
when international currencies are devalued  manufacturing costs of plants in those countries may become more competitive with other established plants 
during fiscal  the brazilian currency experienced severe devaluations which adversely impacted the fiscal operating results in brazil 
at june   we had approximately million of net current assets offset by million in long term intercompany advances subject to this currency exposure 
approximately million of inventory is subject to repricing arrangements for currency fluctuations 
we use other international dollar denominated long term intercompany advances to offset currency exposures in other international subsidiaries 
at june   approximately million of such advances were denominated in finnish marks and approximately million denominated in euros 
the exchange rate fluctuations on these advances and the million denominated in brazilian reais are reflected in the financial statements as translation adjustment in shareholders equity
