com  a leading destination for framed and unframed art and art related supplies for consumers on the internet  and american royal arts  a leading provider of animation art 
our sales are primarily derived from the marketing of image reproduction and broadcasting rights to a range of business customers 
sales generally consist of a large number of relatively small transactions involving the sale or licensing of single images  video and film clips or cd rom products containing between and images 
we use a variety of distribution platforms  including digital distribution via the internet and cd roms as well as analog distribution of mm film  video and analog transparencies 
price is generally determined by resolution size and the extent of rights granted over the use of the image or clip and can vary significantly across geographic markets and customer groups 
we also generate sales from subscription or bulk purchase deals where customers are provided access to imagery online 
in the case of our consumer business  we principally sell framed and unframed art products to consumers over the internet with payment typically being made using a credit card 
revenue arises from three principal types of sales fixed license sales are recognized when a license agreement has been completed with the customer for the use of the image  and the image has been made available for use 
fixed license pricing terms do not call for additional fees beyond the fixed license amount  and our customer is contractually obligated to pay the fixed license amount upon agreement of the license terms and availability of the image for use by the customer 
royalty free sales  or sales in which the user pays a one time fee for unlimited use  are recognized upon the shipment of the cd rom or at the time images are downloaded by the customer 
consumer sales are recognized upon shipment of the product 
circumstances in which sales are refunded are rare  and refunds are netted in the recognition of revenue 
sales are recorded at invoiced amounts less sales tax  if applicable 
e commerce sales are defined as those sales that are transacted on the internet 
our cost of sales primarily consists of commission payments to contributing photographers and cinematographers 
these suppliers are under contract with us and receive payments of up to of sales depending on the type of product and where and how the product is sold 
we own a significant number of the images in our collections and these images do not require commission payments 
cost of sales also includes  to the extent applicable  handling and shipping costs for duplicate transparencies  the cost of cd rom production and costs associated with framing and shipping art products 
as a result  our gross margin is impacted by the mix of sales conducted digitally on the internet  sales of wholly owned imagery  geographic distribution of sales and brand sales mix 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and related staff costs  premises and utility costs  and sales and marketing costs 
we amortize goodwill and depreciate the cost of the investment in duplicate transparencies  digital files  archival picture collections  computer systems and other fixed assets over their expected useful lives 
the acquisitions of photodisc and allsport in february generated million of goodwill and million of other intangibles and the acquisitions of art 
com in may  eyewire in august  american royal arts in october and the image bank in november generated million in goodwill 
goodwill of million arising upon the acquisition of the image bank is currently based upon an initial estimate of the fair value of the image bank s assets and liabilities 
these acquisitions will result in a substantial charge to be amortized against our earnings in future periods 
we are amortizing goodwill relating to acquisitions over the following periods twenty years for the photodisc and allsport goodwill  three years for art 
com goodwill  seven years for eyewire goodwill  five years for american royal arts goodwill and ten years for the image bank goodwill 
we amortize other intangibles over one to four years 
as a result of our various acquisitions and their financial and goodwill accounting effects on net income  we believe that ebitda provides stockholders  investors and analysts with an appropriate measure of our operating performance 
we define ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  exchange gains losses  depreciation  amortization  non recurring integration and restructuring costs  legal settlement and extraordinary items 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity 
following the acquisitions of photodisc and allsport in february  we commenced and substantially completed a program to integrate our then existing businesses 
this resulted in integration and restructuring charges totaling million 
the charges included restructuring costs  severance costs  consulting and professional fees  systems and process integration costs  and costs associated with contract renegotiations and terminations

sales our total sales for  and were million  million and million  respectively  representing increases of in and in over the respective prior year 
these increases were largely attributable to the continued growth of our base businesses  acquisitions we acquired photodisc and allsport in february  art

e commerce sales increased by from million  or of sales  in  to million  or of sales in of sales excluding the image bank  an entirely analog business 
these increases were due  in part  to the inclusion of allsport s and photodisc s e commerce sales since their acquisition in february  as well as the inclusion of art

the launch of the tony stone website in the fourth quarter of contributed significantly to this e commerce sales growth  particularly in north america

termination costs arose in relation to property related exit costs  termination of agents and photographer contracts and employee terminations 
during  we approved and commenced a program to integrate all of our businesses  including the new acquisitions art

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates  relating primarily to our debt instruments  the majority of which are fixed rate borrowings  is shown in the table below

we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to foreign currency denominated liabilities and cash 
the introduction of the euro does not significantly affect our foreign exchange exposure 
we normally enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our contracted net receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
forward foreign currency contracts typically have a term of less than six months 
there were no open forward foreign currency exchange contracts at december  the criteria used by us for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction 
gains and losses on these contracts  relating to the hedged risk  are recognized as incurred  reflecting the income statement treatment of the hedged items 
if an underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as hedges  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balances would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract
