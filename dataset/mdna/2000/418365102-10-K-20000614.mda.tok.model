rental video cost allocation the company adopted a new method of amortizing its rental video assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal in late fiscal  the company completed a series of direct revenue sharing agreements with major studios under which the company acquired approximately of its rental video assets during fiscal the company anticipates that its involvement in revenue sharing agreements will continue to increase moderately in the future 
revenue sharing allows the company to acquire rental video assets at a lower up front capital cost than traditional buying arrangements 
the company then shares with studios a percentage of the actual net rental revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time 
the increased access to additional copies of new releases under revenue sharing agreements will allow customer demand for new releases to be satisfied over a shorter period of time at a time when the new releases are most popular 
since this new business model results in a greater proportion of rental revenue to be received over a reduced rental period because there is more product available when product demand is greater  the company changed its method of amortizing rental video assets in order to better match expenses with revenues 
under the new amortization method  the company continues to expense revenue sharing payments as revenues are recognized under the terms of the specific contracts with supplying studios 
the capitalized cost of all rental video assets acquired for a fixed price is being amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit  except for rental video assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of under the old amortization method  the capitalized cost of base rental video assets typically copies one through four of a title for each store was amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of the capitalized cost of non base units typically copies five and above for each store was amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of the adoption of the accelerated amortization method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and  accordingly  the company recorded a non cash  non recurring  pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increasing net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal by million and per share  respectively

the breach of any of the covenants contained in the amended facility or the amended senior notes could result in a default under the amended facility and the amended senior notes which could result in further advances under the revolving credit facility no longer being available from the lender and could enable the respective lenders to require immediate repayment of the borrowings including accrued interest under the agreements 
if the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings  including accrued interest  the company cannot be certain that its assets would be sufficient to repay such obligations 
the amended facility and the amended senior notes are guaranteed by each of the company s three consolidated subsidiaries  and are in part secured by first priority liens on all of the capital stock and substantially all of the assets of each subsidiary

at january   the company had one other debt obligation totaling million 
the principal on this obligation is payable quarterly until maturity in may in addition  the company maintains two capitalized lease obligations with initial terms of years 
the total amount of these obligations was million at january  seasonality and inflation as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of the company s revenues  and an even greater portion of its operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the christmas selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of the company s annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
the company experiences reduced rentals of video activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of store openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and videocassette titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect retailers in general and the company in particular 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers
