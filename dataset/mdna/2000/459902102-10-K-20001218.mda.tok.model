revenues and gross profit margins for the first time in our near year history  annual revenues for fiscal exceeded the billion mark 
this improvement over fiscal revenues of million resulted from a increase in gaming operations revenue and a increase in product sales revenue 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations worldwide  igt shipped  gaming machines for product sales of million in fiscal versus  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic shipments increased to  units for the current year from  units in fiscal  predominantly due to sales of approximately  units into the new california native american market 
current year domestic shipments to new casinos also included suncoast market share in nevada  hollywood casino market share in louisiana  belterra resort market share in indiana  and greektown casino market share in michigan 
although fiscal offered fewer major casino openings than fiscal  domestic replacement sales were up for the fourth quarter and for the year compared to the same prior year periods  led by strong demand for our newer games 
international shipments  comprising of total units in fiscal  declined to  units compared to  units in fiscal this decline reflected a slower year in japan and latin america  partially offset by increased unit sales in europe  africa  and the united kingdom 
unit sales in australia were virtually flat year over year  but improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the prior year quarter  reflecting improvement from the restructuring plan implemented during fiscal gaming operations revenue for the year ended september  improved to million compared to million in fiscal performance of our gaming operations segment accelerated markedly in fiscal due to significant placements of our newest and most popular game themes 
the installed base of our megajackpots tm machines  including placement under joint ventures  at september  experienced unprecedented year over year growth of to  games from  machines at the end of fiscal our joint venture activities contributed significantly to this growth  led by the installation of  video and spinning reel wheel of fortune r games during the year 
the ever growing popularity of the wheel of fortune r games boosted joint venture revenues  reported net of expenses for accounting purposes  by to million from in the prior year 
also contributing to the overall growth in gaming operations revenue were the successes of multi hand poker tm  party time tm  elvis r and the addams family tm games  as well as the inclusion of sodak s gaming operations revenue 
fiscal brought the installation of new feature rich megajackpots tm games with second event bonusing  incorporating popular themes such as the addams family tm and jeopardy r video 
in recognition that all games have a finite life cycle  igt systematically replaces legacy systems experiencing declining play levels with new systems incorporating enhanced entertainment value and improved player appeal 
of the current installed base  approximately  units are new platform  higher performing games 
during fiscal  we discontinued megajackpots tm systems in eight jurisdictions 
as of september   our megajackpots tm games operated in domestic jurisdictions and one international location versus domestic jurisdictions and one international location at the end of fiscal igt continues to pursue additional markets for our megajackpots tm systems of linked progressive games 
gross profit on total revenues for fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal this positive movement was attributable to growth in profitability for both product sales and gaming operations 
the gross profit margin on product sales improved to in the current fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
margins were positively impacted by a higher percentage of domestic sales in the overall mix  offset by additional costs associated with sourcing more sophisticated electronic components and the rapid production ramp up in the latter half of the year 
the gross profit performance in gaming operations climbed to million or for fiscal from million or in fiscal this improvement was due primarily to increased profits from joint venture activities  which are reported net of expenses for accounting purposes 
the inclusion of sodak s gaming operations revenues and the impact of higher interest rates  which lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments  also contributed to this margin growth 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses fiscal operating expenses  excluding impairment and restructuring charges  totaled million or of total revenue compared to million or in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the inclusion of sodak s operating expenses and increased incentives as the result of improved operating results 
depreciation and amortization expense  not included in cost of sales  declined from the prior year to million  primarily due to the write off of intangible assets in australia in the fourth quarter of fiscal the addition of goodwill and fixed assets relating to the acquisition of sodak partially offset this decline 
research and development expenses increased million to million for the current year  primarily as a result of engineering expenses related to the unprecedented rate of new game development 
bad debt expense increased million over fiscal primarily due to fluctuations in sales volumes 
operating income fiscal operating income  before impairment and restructuring charges  grew to million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues last year 
this improvement was due to the increased gross profit margins in both product sales and gaming operations  partially offset by higher operating expenses  as discussed above 
other income and expense other expense  net for the current year  totaled million versus million in the prior year 
increased interest expense from our outstanding billion senior notes issued in may was partially offset by the million legal settlement received 
operation of our megajackpots tm systems results in interest income from both the investment of cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are similar and increase at approximately the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
our worldwide tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal we expect our tax rate for fiscal to fluctuate between and 
business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements igt s operating profit by business segment reflects an appropriate allocation of selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  interest income and interest expense 
product sales operating profit  before impairment and restructuring charges  for the year ended september  improved to million or of related revenues compared to million or in fiscal including the one time charges for impairment and restructuring of million  product sales operating loss for the year ended october  was million 
this fluctuation reflects increased sales volume  offset by increased research and development costs  and increased interest expense allocated to the product sales segment from our billion senior notes proceeds used to fund the acquisition of sodak in september in fiscal  operating profit for the gaming operations segment totaled million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
this improvement resulted from the growth of the installed base and excellent player acceptance of our new megajackpots tm systems games  the continued popularity of the wheel of fortune r games  higher interest rates which lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments  and the inclusion of gaming operations revenue from sodak 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net income of million or per diluted share included certain one time charges recorded in the fourth quarter totaling million million or per diluted share  net of tax as discussed below 
an extraordinary loss on early redemption of debt of million or per diluted share was also recognized during fiscal net income for the year ended october  before the one time charges and extraordinary loss totaled million or per diluted share versus net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal the one time charges in fiscal of million consisted primarily of the write off of intangible assets of million related to igt australia s prior acquisition of olympic 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to return igt australia to a profitable operation  we initiated a significant restructuring plan in late fiscal which included narrowing current product lines and utilizing igt s reno  nevada manufacturing plant to reduce product costs 
we recorded restructuring costs of million in fiscal related to this plan  including a million inventory obsolescence charge and million in asset and facility redundancy costs 
we also recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  relating to changes in our recoverability assessment of inventory and receivables in brazil 
in fiscal the government in brazil rescinded the law allowing gaming devices in bingo halls throughout this market 
revenues and cost of sales fiscal revenues of million improved over fiscal revenues of million 
this improvement resulted from a increase in product sales revenue as well as a increase in gaming operations revenue 
we shipped  gaming machines for total product sales revenues of million in fiscal compared to  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic shipments totaled  units for the year ended october  compared to  units in the year earlier period 
the four major new casino openings in the las vegas  nevada market  as well as growth in the canadian and native american markets  positively impacted domestic product sales during fiscal shipments to new las vegas properties included park place s paris resort  the resort at summerlin  the mandalay bay and the venetian resort 
also contributing to the fiscal improvement were shipments of  machines to the ontario lottery commission and  machines to new casinos in detroit  michigan 
domestic revenues for fiscal also benefited from increased demand in the native american market 
in june  we became a licensed manufacturer for native american venues in washington 
fiscal sales included  games for a market share of approximately to a washington licensee who designs and markets gaming machines for placement in eight native american casinos 
international shipments of  machines in fiscal accounted for of total units  the highest percentage in our history  compared to  machines in fiscal this growth in international unit shipments was driven primarily by japan and barcrest which contributed increased shipments of approximately  units each 
growth in japanese pachisuro sales were driven by the introduction of popular game themes including popper king tm  dynamite tm and elvis r 
fiscal shipments for barcrest  which was acquired in march  include a full year of results 
machine shipments in the australia market totaled  units in fiscal compared to  machines in fiscal the lack of anticipated growth in the fiscal unit sales as a result of the olympic acquisition influenced our assessment of the igt australia intangible asset impairment 
the gross margin on product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this fluctuation is the result of an increase in the mix of new domestic product lines  including the game king r and vision series r platforms  which have lower gross margin percentages yet higher gross margin dollars along with increased obsolescence expense domestically 
the gross margin was also impacted by the higher percentage of international sales during which are typically at lower gross margins 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gaming operations revenue for the year ended october  totaled million compared to million in fiscal this growth primarily resulted from joint venture activities 
the total installed base of gaming machines operating on our megajackpots tm systems at october  increased to  games on systems from  machines on systems at the end of fiscal joint venture games including wheel of fortune r contributed million to total gaming operations revenues for fiscal during fiscal we began operating megajackpots tm systems in two new jurisdictions  iowa and michigan 
we introduced new systems in nine jurisdictions during the year including the slotopoly tm  elvis r  party time tm and triple play poker tm in the megajackpots tm system formats in atlantic city 
the introduction of these new systems in various jurisdictions offset the decrease in revenue of other maturing systems 
the gross margin on gaming operations revenues was in fiscal compared to in the fiscal this improvement was due primarily to profits from joint venture activities which  for accounting purposes  are reported net of expenses in gaming operations revenues 
additionally  higher average interest rates lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments 
expenses fiscal operating expenses totaled million  including the million impairment of assets and restructuring charges 
operating expenses before the one time charges discussed above as a percent of total revenue were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the inclusion of operating expenses attributable to the businesses acquired in the uk and australia in march  along with increased wages  professional services and domestic advertising  marketing  and compliance expenses related to new product offerings 
depreciation and amortization expenses totaled million in the fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to amortization of goodwill and additional depreciation of the acquired assets 
research and development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of a full year of barcrest and olympic operations along with higher engineering expenditures domestically related to the development of over new games 
bad debt expense increased million over fiscal due to growth in product sales as well as additional reserves for gaming operations activities 
other income and expense other expense  net  for fiscal totaled million and was impacted by interest expense of million on the billion senior notes issued in may other income  net for fiscal totaled million which included a gain on the sale of the igt australia manufacturing facility of million 
operation of our megajackpots tm systems results in interest income from both the investment of cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are similar and increase at approximately the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements product sales and gaming operations operating profit reflects an allocation of selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses to each of these business segments 
product sales operating loss was million for the year ended october   including the one time charges for impairment and restructuring of million 
product sales operating profit before these charges totaled million compared to million in the prior period 
this fluctuation resulted from a decline in the gross margin to from in the prior year  as well as increased domestic advertising  marketing  and compliance expenses  increased selling expenses in japan  and the inclusion of a full year of operating expenses from barcrest and olympic 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal gaming operations operating profit increased million or compared to fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from the continued popularity of the wheel of fortune r games and higher average interest rates  which resulted in lower costs of funding jackpot payments 
foreign operations approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal were derived outside of north america 
to date  we have not experienced significant translation or transaction losses related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources capital resources igt s sources of capital include  but are not limited to  cash flows from operations  the issuance of public or private placement debt  bank borrowings  and the issuance of equity securities 
we believe that our available short term and long term capital resources are sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and operating capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest and income tax obligations  strategic investments  acquisitions  and share repurchases 
our sources of capital afford us the financial flexibility to target acquisition of businesses that offer opportunities to implement our operating strategies  increase our rates of return  and improve shareholder value 
credit facilities and indebtedness our domestic and foreign borrowing facilities totaled million at september  of this amount  million was drawn  million was reserved for letters of credit and the remaining million was available for future borrowings 
we are required to comply with certain covenants contained in these agreements which  among other things  limit financial commitments we may make without the written consent of the lenders and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
in may  we completed the private placement of billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the senior notes were issued in two tranches million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at 
in august  we exchanged all outstanding senior notes for identical registered notes 
a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem previously outstanding senior notes due  which resulted in a prepayment penalty of million  net of tax 
additionally  we repaid outstanding borrowings under both our us and australian credit facilities 
the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used to fund our acquisition of sodak  working capital  and share repurchases 
the issuance of our billion of senior notes could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on our indebtedness and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and disadvantaging us compared to competitors with less indebtedness 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations on the senior notes and our other indebtedness will depend on our future performance 
in addition  our bank revolving line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial ratio tests 
our ability to maintain such ratio tests will also depend on our future performance 
our future performance will be subject to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we were unable to maintain the financial ratio tests under the bank revolving line of credit  the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if this happened  other indebtedness that contains cross default or cross acceleration provisions  including the senior notes  may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events should occur  we may not be able to pay such amounts and the senior notes 
summary of cash activities igt s principal sources of cash consisted of million derived from operations and million in proceeds from the october sale of the miss marquette riverboat held for sale as part of the sodak acquisition 
our primary use of cash was share repurchases of million 
our proprietary megajackpots tm systems provide cash through collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and from maturities of us government securities purchased to fund jackpot liabilities 
cash is used to make payments to jackpot winners or to purchase investments to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
these activities used cash of million in the current year and million in fiscal the net cash provided by these activities for fiscal was million 
fluctuations in net cash flows from systems represent differences between the growth in liabilities for jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period  based on the timing of the jackpot cycles and the volume of play across all of our megajackpots tm systems 
operating activities cash flows from operating activities in fiscal resulted from the favorable operating performance discussed earlier 
fiscal operating cash flow increased due to the realization of deferred tax assets related to the timing of the tax deductibility of jackpot payments 
federal legislation was passed in october allowing jackpot winners to receive the discounted value of progressive jackpots won in lieu of annual installments 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities in the current year was primarily due to proceeds from the october sale of the miss marquette riverboat held for sale as part of the sodak acquisition 
the primary use of investing cash in fiscal related to our acquisition of businesses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
use of cash from investing activities also included purchases of property  plant  and equipment totaling million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal financing activities the primary use of cash in financing activities in the current year related to treasury stock purchases 
net borrowings in the prior year periods were used primarily to fund business acquisitions  stock repurchases  and working capital

euro currency conversions on january   of member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency the euro 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued and the former currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries effected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include the need to adapt financial systems and business processes  changes required to equipment  such as coin validators and note acceptors  to accommodate euro denominated transactions in our current products  and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
we do not expect material system and equipment conversion costs related exclusively to the euro 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects that one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on our financial condition or results of operations 
year igt s year strategic plan identified initiatives necessary to minimize failures of our electronic systems to process date sensitive information in and beyond the year necessary modifications and replacements of our critical systems were completed timely 
to date we have not experienced any significant failures of our electronic systems related to year processing issues 
the total cost to accomplish our year plan was million  of which approximately million was capitalized for the replacement of non compliant equipment and software 
we continue to monitor systems performance to assure compliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk market risk under established procedures and controls  we enter into contractual arrangements or derivatives  in the ordinary course of business  to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and we believe that credit loss in the event of nonperformance is remote 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations denominated in non functional currency 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes 
at september   we had net foreign currency exposure of million hedged with million in currency forward contracts 
at october   we had net foreign currency exposure of million  of which million was hedged with currency forward item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk contracts 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
igt does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating results include the australian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating results by less than million 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk igt s results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in bank lending rates and the cost of us government securities  both of which are used to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
we record gaming operations expense for future jackpots based on these rates which are impacted by market interest rates and other economic conditions 
therefore  the gross profit on gaming operations decreases when interest rates decline 
we estimated that a decline in interest rates would impact gaming operations gross profit by million in the current year  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal igt currently does not manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
our outstanding senior notes carry interest at fixed rates 
if interest rates increased by  then the fair market value of these notes would decrease approximately million at september  and million at october
