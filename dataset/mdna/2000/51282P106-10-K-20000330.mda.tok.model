net income grew from million in to million in net income increased from million in to million in total loans rose from million at december   to million at december  total securities increased from million at december   to million at december  total deposits increased from million at december   to million at december  the growth in net income has been caused primarily by higher income resulting from increased volume in earning assets 
loans have increased because of greater market penetration and strong loan demand in the company s market area due to economic growth 
securities have risen because of additional funds available for investment resulting from increased deposits and other borrowed funds 
deposits increased because of the company s strategies to attract new deposits and the continued strong economic growth in the region 
the net interest margin has declined from for to for as a result of decreases in yields on interest earning assets that have not been offset by similar decreases in cost of interest bearing liabilities 
for the years ended december   and results of operations net interest income the principal source of the company s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans and investment securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowings used to fund those assets 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the level of interest rates 
the change in net interest income is typically measured by net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
net interest income increased in compared with  following a increase in compared with the increase in and is attributable to an increase in the company s average interest earning assets of and  respectively  principally in the loan and investment securities portfolios 
during  average interest bearing liabilities increased million to million  an increase of over this was primarily from increases in other borrowed funds  time deposits and transaction accounts 
in  average interest bearing liabilities increased to million 
this increase of million was primarily in time deposits and transaction accounts 
the company s net interest margin was in  in  and in the increase in net interest margin in from resulted from a decrease in yield on interest earning assets of 
while the company s cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 
the net reduction in net interest margin in compared with resulted from a decrease in yield on interest earning assets of

the net interest margin may be negatively affected by the interest rate environment and changes in the earning asset mix and deposit funding mix 
increased rates may have a negative impact on the company s borrowing and deposit funding costs

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated by management and approved by the board of directors and is maintained at a level believed to be adequate to absorb future loan losses in the company s portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is determined in part using an internal watch list developed by a review of essentially all loans by management 
loans are assigned a rating based on credit quality as determined by the borrower s payment history  the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor as measured by the balance sheet  earnings and cash flow quality  collateral values  and the liquidity and quality of the collateral and assets of the borrower 
loans with a deterioration of credit quality are placed on the watch list 
the provision for loan losses pertaining to the rated loans is determined by the amount of loans on the watch list and an allocation for loans that are not on the watch list based on the company s historical charge off percentage 
in addition  management considers the potential adverse impact of the economic trends in the company s trade area on certain borrowers that are in cyclical businesses and the loan growth resulting from new loan customers 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   was adequate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make allowance provisions  future adjustments which could be material may be necessary if management s assumptions differ from the loan portfolio s actual future performance 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december   to december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of loans

when loans are placed on non accrual status  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
these loans remain on non accrual status until the borrower demonstrates the ability to remain current or the loan is deemed uncollectible and is charged off

asset liability management and market risk asset liability management control is designed to ensure safety and soundness  maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards  and achieve acceptable net interest income 
management considers interest rate risk to be the company s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
management regularly monitors interest rate risk in relation to prospective market and business conditions 
the company s board of directors sets policy guidelines establishing maximum limits on the company s interest rate risk exposure 
management monitors and adjusts exposure to interest rate fluctuations as influenced by the company s loan  investment and deposit portfolios 
the company uses an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effect on interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of basis points 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of the company s deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and the application of various management strategies 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining acceptable net interest income within policy limits approved by the board of directors 
the company s board of directors monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income resulting from market interest rate changes 
the company s interest rate risk policy  as approved by the board of directors  is stated in terms of the change in net interest income given a basis point immediate and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are plus or minus of net interest income for a basis point movement 
in august of and january of  the company purchased interest rate floors for three years in notional amounts of million each  which effectively converted less than of the company s loans at december   to a minimum fixed rate basis 
a premium of  was paid for the floors and amortized over the terms of each 
the index used is the three month libor rate with a floor rate 
the three month libor rate was at december  through december  the bank has amortized  of the premium and received  which has been recognized as adjustments to net interest income

a basis point immediate  sustained decrease to the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 
these potential changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the company s board of directors 
these interest rate sensitivity profiles of the company at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities and may not be a precise measurement of the effect of changing interest rates on the company in the future 
year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the total project cost was approximately  for the purchase of new software and hardware and the modification of existing software and hardware with  of the total capitalized and the remaining  expensed during the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
