liquidity and capital resources management assesses the corporation s liquidity in terms of its overall debt capacity and ability to generate cash from operations to fund its operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  customer financing requirements  adequate bank lines of credit and financial flexibility to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms

euro on january   a majority of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro monetary as their new common legal currency 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and the participating countries own currencies legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that these legacy currencies will no longer be available after july  the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
gbc has assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
gbc has also assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro  and to accommodate the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
gbc s currency risk and risk management programs for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
gbc will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the euro 
based on current information and gbc s current assessment  management does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material effect on gbc s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and requires gbc to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting 
gbc will be required to implement sfas no 
for its fiscal year gbc does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its results of operations
