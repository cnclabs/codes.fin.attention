ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
the company considers ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of the company s presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits
