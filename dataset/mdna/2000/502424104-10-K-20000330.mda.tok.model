during cash invested in operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with million for the increase was principally related to the greater working capital requirements primarily in contracts in process 
operating activities are a principal source of l s cash flows

in addition  million shares were sold in the february common stock offering by the lehman partnership and lockheed martin 
in october  lockheed martin sold its remaining ownership interest in holdings common stock in a private transaction

the senior credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes contain financial covenants which remain in effect so long as any amount is owed or any commitment to lend exists thereunder by l communications 
as of december   l communications had been in compliance with these covenants at all times 
the borrowings under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by holdings and by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries 
the payments of principal and premium  if any  and interest on the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries 
see note to consolidated combined financial statements for a description of the company s debt and related financial covenants at december  based upon the current level of operations  management believes that the company s cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  program and other discretionary investments  and interest payments for the foreseeable future including at least the next three years 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt  it may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
the company s ability to make scheduled principal payments  to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable the company to service its indebtedness  or make necessary capital expenditures and program and discretionary investments 
market risks all of the company s market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk 
the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities and purchased interest rate cap contracts and written interest rate floor contracts  all of which are denominated in us dollars 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes are fixed rate  and therefore  are not affected by changes in interest rates 
to mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on borrowings under the senior credit facilities which bear interest at variable rates the company entered into interest rate cap and floor contracts the interest rate agreements 
the purchased interest rate cap provides protection against increases in interest rates on borrowings to the extent i those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the cap contract and ii the interest rate paid on the borrowings rises above the cap reference rate plus the company s applicable borrowing spread 
conversely  the written interest rate floor limits the ability of the company to enjoy decreases in interest rates on its borrowings to the extent i those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the floor contract and ii the interest rate paid on those borrowings falls below the floor reference rate plus the company s applicable borrowing spread 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into the interest rate agreements only with major financial institutions that are expected to perform fully under the terms of such agreements 
cash payments between the company and the counterparties are made received at the end of each quarter to the extent due under the terms of the interest rate agreements 
such payments amounts received are recorded as adjustments to interest expense and were not material to interest expense or cash flows for  or for the nine month period ended december  additional data on the company s debt obligations  its applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates it pays on borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate agreements are provided in notes and to the consolidated combined financial statements 
the weighted average interest rate on the senior subordinated notes is 
the senior subordinated notes mature in and and there are no scheduled principal payments before their maturity dates 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facilities at the end of for the interest rate agreements  the table below presents significant contract terms and fair values at december  caps floors in millions notional amount cap floor interest rate reference rate libor libor designated maturity quarterly quarterly expiration date march  march  fair value foreign currency exchange risk 
the company conducts certain of its operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to these foreign operations is not material to the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
equity price risk 
the company s investments in common equities are subject to equity price risks 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such instruments amounted to million at the end of backlog the company s funded backlog at december   and was  million  million and million  respectively 
funded orders for the company for  and were  million   million and million  respectively 
it is expected that approximately of the backlog at december  will be recorded as sales during the year ending december  however  there can be no assurance that the company s backlog will become revenues in any particular period  if at all 
approximately of the total backlog at december  was directly or indirectly for defense contracts for end use by the us government 
approximately million of total backlog at december  was directly or indirectly for us and foreign government defense contracts  and approximately million of the backlog was directly or indirectly for us and foreign government non defense contracts 
foreign customers accounted for approximately million of the backlog 
research and development research and development costs including bid and proposal costs r d costs sponsored by the company for  and for the nine month period ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
customer funded research and development for  and the nine month period ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
r d costs sponsored by the predecessor company and customer funded research and development were million and million  respectively  for the three month period ended march  the decrease in customer funded research and development in was primarily attributable to the transition of research and development programs into production 
contingencies see note to the consolidated combined financial statements 
recently issued and proposed accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after september  in september  the fasb issued a proposed new accounting standard for business combinations that  among other things  would change the accounting for and display of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in business acquisitions for transactions after january  an important aspect of the proposal is that goodwill amortization would be displayed as a separate element in the statement of operations  net of applicable income tax benefits  and related earnings per share effects could be displayed 
on the basis presented in the proposed accounting standard  l estimates that it would have reported diluted earnings per share before amortization of goodwill of in  in  and for the nine month period ended december  there can be no assurance that this proposed accounting standard will be issued 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of the company s sales are made under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some contracts provide for price adjustments through escalation clauses 
year the company has not experienced any impact to its business since the year roll over either internally or from its customers and infrastructure suppliers 
the planned phases of the year efforts have been completed with total cost for all the efforts of million which included million of capitalized costs 
because the company s business units operate autonomously  each business unit had undertaken efforts to identify and mitigate year issues related to their information systems  products  facilities  suppliers and customers  such effects were coordinated through a company wide program instituted to oversee  guide and track each business unit s year efforts 
additionally  contingency plans for suppliers  customers  critical systems and utilities impacted by year issues were developed 
a scaled down organizational structure for the program will remain in place through the end of the first quarter to address any unanticipated occurrences that arise 
although the company has experienced no failures in infrastructure systems and in the customer and supply chains since the year roll over  the likelihood and effect of such failure cannot be estimated  but such a failure could potentially result in a material adverse impact on results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company

such statements will also be influenced by factors such as our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry including changing priorities or reductions in the us government defense budget  our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of  or contractors to  the us government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform  the ability to obtain or the timing of obtaining future government contracts  the availability of government funding and customer requirements  economic conditions  competitive environment  international business and political conditions  timing of international awards and contracts  our extensive use of fixed price contracts as compared to cost plus contracts  our ability to identify future acquisition candidates or to integrate acquired operations  the rapid change of technology in the communication equipment industry  the high level of competition in the communications equipment industry  our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in commercial products or companies  the significant amount of our debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements  year issues  collective bargaining labor disputes  pension  environmental or legal matters or proceedings and various other market  competition and industry factors  many of which are beyond our control
