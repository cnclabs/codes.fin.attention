historically  the company s primary sources of financing have come from public offerings and borrowings from its stockholders  private investors and financial institutions 
in april and august  the company completed an initial public offering and a follow on offering of its common stock which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the company of approximately million

cash flows from operations in were favorable due to continuing improvements of inventory and payables management

as of december  and  the company had advances outstanding of million and million  respectively  under a million line of credit with a finance company 
the line of credit allows working capital advances up to million and floorplan inventory financing up to million  however  aggregate advances and floorplan financing cannot exceed million 
the advances outstanding at december  and relate to floorplan inventory financing to purchase inventory  which is included in accounts payable 
there were no outstanding working capital advances at december  or working capital advances are also limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory collateral

the company believes that current working capital  together with cash flows from operations and available lines of credit  will be adequate to support the company s current operating plans through however  if the company needs extra funds  such as for acquisitions or expansion or to fund a significant downturn in sales that causes losses  there are no assurances that adequate financing will be available at acceptable terms  if at all 
in july  the company announced its plan to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
no limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that the company will repurchase 
subject to applicable securities laws  repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as the company s management deems appropriate 
the program can also be discontinued at any time management feels additional purchases are not warranted 
the company will finance the repurchase plan with existing working capital 
as of december   the company has repurchased  shares 
as part of its growth strategy  the company may  in the future  acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  and pursue other business ventures 
any launch of a new business venture or any acquisition and the ensuing integration of the operations of the acquired company with those of the company would place additional demands on the company s management  operating and financial resources 
the company currently has no definitive agreements with respect to any acquisitions 
year computer systems  software packages  and microprocessor dependent equipment may cease to function or generate erroneous data during the year or thereafter 
the problem affects those systems or products that are programmed to accept a two digit code in date code fields 
to correctly identify dates after december   a four digit date code field must be created to be what is commonly termed year compliant 
in prior reports  the company has discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its testing and remediation of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems  and the company believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately million during in connection with its testing and remediation efforts 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
although the company has not experienced any material year problems or disruptions since january   there can be no assurance that such problems or disruptions will not occur in the future 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  and the company does not expect it to have such an impact in the near future 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s business will not be so affected by inflation
