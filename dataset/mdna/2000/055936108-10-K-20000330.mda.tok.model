results of operations net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the company s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates paid on those liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to bnc s average balance sheets and reflects the yield on average assets and costs of average liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities

b the company has increased its investment securities holdings primarily through fhlb borrowings 
c the decreased loan yield is reflective of the basis point decline in the prime rate late in as well as a decrease in loan pricing spread to prime rate due to competitive pressures in all markets 
d deposit growth primarily attributable to the introduction of the wealthbuilder now and money market accounts 
e increased fhlb borrowings for the purpose of purchasing investment securities 
f reduced costs on certificates of deposit cds caused by the overall decreased rate environment and related lower cd renewal and offering rates 
these rate reductions were somewhat offset by increased costs in the now and money market deposit category related to the wealthbuilder accounts 
g rates are reflective of the overall decreased rate environment 
net interest income and margin in future periods are expected to be impacted by several factors 
recent increases in the prime rate will improve interest income and yields on loans 
additionally  the company has increased its earning asset portfolio by purchasing investment securities funded primarily through fhlb borrowings 
while the additional investments will increase interest income  net interest income and earnings  they can be expected to negatively impact yield on earning assets and net interest margin because yields on such investments are typically lower than those achieved in the loan portfolio 
many factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive environment in the markets in which the company operates  the multitude of financial and investment products available to the public and the monetary policies of the frb  can materially impact the company s operating results 
therefore  management cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  prospects for net interest income in future periods

the borrowing rates charged by the fhlb were often cost effective compared to offering top of market rates for time cd s 
increase also reflects issuance of the company s percent subordinated notes in may outstanding months during versus months during 
h increased reliance on borrowing caused a higher percentage of the interest bearing liabilities portfolio to be comprised of borrowings with generally higher costs than interest bearing deposits 
however  the borrowing rates charged by the fhlb were often cost effective compared to offering top of market rates for time certificates of deposits  although these borrowing rates are higher than costs of interest bearing checking and money market accounts

provision for credit losses 
management determines a provision for credit losses which it considers sufficient to maintain the company s allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item and financial condition loan portfolio allowance for credit losses for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in and million in noninterest income

a increased insurance commissions resulted from an increase in the average number of insurance producers as well as successful efforts to cross sell insurance to bank customers 
b the increase in loan fees is largely attributable to loans generated and sold by bnc minnesota 
management cannot predict with any degree of certainty the amount of loans which will be originated and related loan fees which will be recognized in future periods 
c increase is attributable to the addition of brokerage staff in bnc north dakota s subsidiary  bnc asset management  inc d proceeds from securities sold were million in as compared to million in see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information related to sales of investment securities

financial condition investment securities 
bnc s investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio and the composition of the entire balance sheet  the company seeks a balance among earnings  credit and liquidity considerations  with a goal of maximizing the longer term overall profitability of the company 
investments are centrally managed in order to maximize compliance federal laws and regulations place certain restrictions on the amounts and types of investments bnc may hold and effectiveness of overall investing activities 
the primary goal of bnc s investment policy is to contribute to the overall profitability of the company 
the objective is to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics 
good risk reward securities are those identified through thorough analysis of the cash flows and potential cash flows as well as market value and potential market value of the security in question given various interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies are developed in light of constant view of the company s overall asset liability position 
as it relates to investment strategies  the focus of the asset liability management committee is to determine the impact of interest rate changes on both future income and market value of securities in the portfolio 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional information relating to the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the company s net interest income

maturities of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on contractual maturities 
yield reflects changes in fair value that are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as of december   bnc had million of securities in the investment portfolio as compared to and million at december  and  respectively 
during  the company increased its holdings in agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and municipal bonds by and million  respectively 
during the year  the company also reduced the investment portfolio s allocation to us treasury securities by million  agency mortgage backed securities by million and government agency securities by million 
the shift between sectors was the result of the investment portfolio management process and the investment objectives as indicated above 
over the course of  principal cash flows as well as sales proceeds from mortgage backed securities were invested in cmos because they offered a better risk reward profile due to the structure of cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed securities 
new investment purchases were primarily directed toward cmos as well due to their risk reward profile and structure relative to other sectors 
in addition  proceeds from the maturity of us treasury securities and government agency securities were reinvested into alternate sectors that offered a better relative risk reward profile than us treasury and government agency securities 
consistent with the investment officer s objective of purchasing and owning combinations of good risk reward securities  the level of state and municipal bonds increased as well 
the risk reward profile of state and municipal bonds complimented that of the increased portfolio allocation to cmos 
the resulting allocation among security sectors is more consistent with the primary goal of the company s investment policy 
at december   bnc held no securities of any single issuer  other than the us government agencies securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos that exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of the company s investment securities portfolio approximately percent at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb 
loan portfolio 
the company s primary source of income is interest earned on loans 
the company s loan portfolio has grown significantly during the past four years as a result of bnc s strategy of increasing the amount of high quality loans outstanding to increase net interest income 
net loans increased million  or percent  to million at december  as compared to million at december  in  net loans increased million  or percent  as compared to december  the following table presents the composition of the company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated loan portfolio composition december  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands commercial and industrial      real estate mortgage      real estate construction      agricultural      consumer      lease financing      total face amount of loans      unearned income loans  net of unearned income

a increases are primarily attributable to loan volume generated out of the minnesota market area 
b increases are attributable to loan volume generated out of both the minnesota and north dakota markets 
while prospects for continued loan growth appear favorable  particularly in the minnesota and fargo markets  management cannot predict with any degree of certainty the company s future loan growth potential 
credit policy and approval procedures 
bnc follows a uniform credit policy that sets forth underwriting and loan administration criteria 
the loan policy  including lending guidelines for the various types of credit offered by the company  is established by the board of directors the board based upon the recommendations of senior lending management and such credit committees as are established at either the bank or corporate level 
the loan policy is reviewed and reaffirmed by the board at least annually 
underwriting criteria are based upon the risks associated with each type of credit offered  the related borrowers and types of collateral 
the company delegates lending decision authority among various lending officers and the credit committees based on the size of the customer s credit relationship with bnc 
all loans and commitments approved in excess of  are presented to the board on a monthly basis for summary review 
any exceptions to loan policies and guidelines are subject to special approval by bank executive lenders or the credit committees 
loan participations 
pursuant to bnc s lending policy  loans may not exceed percent of bank legal lending limits except to the extent collateralized by us treasury securities or bank deposits and  accordingly  excluded from the bank s legal lending limit 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed lending limits and internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentration  the banks sell loan participations to outside participants without recourse 
loan participations sold on a nonrecourse basis to outside financial institutions were as follows as of the dates indicated loan participations sold december  in thousands bnc north dakota      bnc minnesota     total      from continuing operations for all periods presented 
the banks generally retain the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
the vast majority of the loans sold by the banks are commercial lines of credit for which balances and related payment streams cannot be reasonably estimated in order to determine the fair value of the servicing rights and or future interest income retained by the banks 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion of accounting policies related to loans 
management cannot reliably predict bnc s ability to continue to generate or sell loan participations or the terms of any such sales 
concentrations of credit 
the company s credit policies emphasize diversification of risk among industries  geographic areas and borrowers 
for purposes of the analysis of concentrations of credit as of december   total outstanding loans as well as all outstanding loan commitments were included 
as of december   the company identified concentrations of loans exceeding ten percent of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
these concentrations were in construction and real estate loans which represented and percent  respectively  of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
loans and commitments in the construction category were extended to customers who are located in minnesota  iowa and north and south dakota and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding loans and number of loan customers commitments general building contractors heavy construction  excluding building special trade contractors total the contractors are involved in various aspects of the construction industry including highway and street construction  water sewer drilling  plumbing  heating and air conditioning  commercial painting  electrical  concrete and excavating and foundation contractors 
loans in this category are secured  in many cases  by construction equipment 
the real estate loans and commitments were extended to customers who are diversified across the company s market areas and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding loans and number of loan customers commitments non residential and apartment building operators  developers and lessors of real property real estate holding companies 
total the company continually monitors industry and other credit concentrations as part of its credit risk management strategies 
in cases where significant concentrations exist without sufficient diversification and other mitigating factors  bnc generally sells loans without recourse to outside financial institutions 
agricultural loans 
bnc s agricultural loan portfolio totals approximately million  or percent of total loans 
within the portfolio  loans are diversified by type and include loans to grain and or livestock producers  agricultural real estate loans  machinery and equipment and other types of loans 
the majority of the company s agricultural loans are extended to borrowers located in north dakota  and are diversified over several counties 
the company has been monitoring its agricultural loans closely 
as of december   nonperforming agricultural loans totaled  loan maturities 
the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of loans in each major category of bnc s portfolio as of december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications maturities of loans over year through years over years one year fixed floating fixed floating or less rate rate rate rate total in thousands commercial and industrial       real estate mortgage       real estate construction    agricultural       consumer    lease financing    total face amount of loans       maturities are based upon contractual maturities 
floating rate loans include loans that would reprice prior to maturity if base rates change 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further discussion regarding repricing of loans and other assets 
interest rate floors 
from time to time the company may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including loans 
see liquidity  market and credit risk  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion about accounting policies applicable to derivative financial instruments and currently outstanding instruments 
nonperforming loans and assets 
bnc s lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officer compensation depends  to a substantial extent  on maintaining loan quality and dealing with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
lenders are not compensated for growth at the expense of credit quality 
loan officers are responsible for ongoing and regular review of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by the company s loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a monthly basis 
the company also has an annual independent credit review which tests credit quality  compliance with loan policy and documentation for all loans over  and a sampling of smaller loans 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets  the allowance for credit losses and certain related ratios nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual loans   restructured loans total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned and repossessed assets   total nonperforming assets

from continuing operations for all periods presented 
if the company s nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  bnc would have recognized additional interest income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in the company s net income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest include loans over days past due which management believes  based on its specific analysis of the loans  do not present doubt about the collection of interest and principal in accordance with the loan contract 
loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
these loans are monitored closely by bnc lending and management personnel 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of its original principal will occur 
other real estate owned represents properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
such properties are included in other assets in the balance sheets 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
potential problem loans 
in accordance with accounting standards  the company identifies loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which management believes  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
bnc generally considers all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
impaired loans at december   not including the past due  nonaccrual and restructured loans reported above  totaled million 
a significant portion of these loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that the company s position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
customer year issues 
the company implemented a year due diligence program relating to its major borrowers and depositors which incorporated guidelines established by regulatory agencies the program 
major components of the program included assignment of accountability for the various program initiatives  establishment of critical program completion dates  identification of material borrowers and depositors hereinafter collectively referred to as customers  a risk assessment of all identified customers and the establishment of risk controls 
the company managed the program with available staff 
therefore  no additional salary and benefit expenses were incurred in the process of implementing and administering the program 
other expenses incurred  such as postage and materials  were not significant 
no material adverse circumstances related to year issues of customers have been identified 
assessment of customer status with respect to year issues  while critical to the banking industry  is by nature subjective and imprecise 
while the company has used due diligence in assessing customer status and taking appropriate actions based on the results of such assessments  there can be no assurance that each of its customers has been adequately prepared and  as a result  the potential of an adverse impact on the company cannot be completely eliminated 
see also year issue for further information on the company s year program 
allowance for credit losses 
bnccorp maintains an allowance for credit losses sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is adjusted through the provision for credit losses  which is charged to income 
at yearend  the company s total allowance was million which equates to approximately and times the average charge offs for the last three and five years  respectively  and and times the average net charge offs for the same three and five year periods  respectively 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  the company also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
the company s charge off policy is generally consistent with regulatory standards 
the three components to the allowance for credit losses  the specific allowance  allocated inherent allowance and unallocated inherent allowance  are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item a comprehensive analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is performed by the company on a quarterly basis 
additionally  peer review of allowance levels of other financial institutions is conducted on an annual basis 
historically  senior lending management in each of bnccorp s banking subsidiaries has been responsible for assessing the adequacy of the respective subsidiary s allowance for credit losses and making provision for credit losses recommendations to the appropriate board of directors 
the company recently established an allowance for credit losses review committee the review committee  which now has the responsibility of affirming allowance methodology  performing an annual credit loss migration analysis and assessing the allowance components in relation to estimated and actual charge off trends 
the review committee is responsible for assessing and reporting on the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses as well as recommending revisions to the company s methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance as they become necessary 
concentrations of credit risk are discussed under concentrations of credit 
concentrations exist in construction and real estate loans 
additionally  a geographic concentration of credit risk also arises because bnccorp operates primarily in the upper midwest with percent of loans outstanding as of december  having been extended to customers in minnesota and north dakota 
other groups of credit risk may not constitute a significant concentration  but are analyzed based on other evident risk factors for the purpose of determining an adequate allowance level 
nonperforming and potential problem loans are defined and discussed under nonperforming loans and assets and potential problem loans 
nonperforming loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  many of these loans are specifically analyzed for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
estimating the risk and amount of loss on any loan is subjective and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
although management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require bnc to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  activity in the allowance for credit losses  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to operating expense  the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans  the ratio of the allowance to total loans at the end of each period and the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans analysis of allowance for credit losses for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance of allowance for credit losses  beginning of period      charge offs commercial and industrial    real estate mortgage agricultural consumer lease financing total charge offs    recoveries commercial and industrial real estate mortgage agricultural consumer lease financing total recoveries net charge offs    provision for credit losses charged to operations    allowance attributable to fmb sale balance of allowance for credit losses  end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans

liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on the company s earnings or value 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a customer to perform according to the terms of a contract 
bnc is a party to transactions involving financial instruments that create risks that may or may not be reflected on a traditional balance sheet 
these financial instruments can be subdivided into three categories cash financial instruments  generally characterized as on balance sheet items  include investments  loans  mortgage based securities  deposits and other debt obligations 
credit related financial instruments  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
derivative financial instruments  also generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity price and equity price contracts  including forwards  swaps and options 
the company s risk management policies are intended to monitor and limit exposure to liquidity  market and credit risks that arise from each of these financial instruments 
see loan portfolio for a discussion of the company s credit risk management strategies 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk management encompasses the company s ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  bnc utilizes brokered deposits  sells securities under agreements to repurchase and borrows overnight federal funds 
the banks are both members of the fhlb  which affords them the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to ten years and beyond 
borrowings from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the banks mortgage loans and various investment securities 
see investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item the company has also obtained funding through long term borrowings and the issuance of its subordinated notes 
see borrowed funds and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s major sources and uses of funds

bnc s liquidity is measured by its ability to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
given the uncertain nature of our customer s demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity is supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines with the fhlb  credit lines with correspondent banks for federal funds  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  brokered certificates of deposit and direct non brokered national certificates of deposit through national deposit networks 
bnc s management measures its liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine the company s liquidity are the reliability or stability of its deposit base  the pledged nonpledged status of its investments and potential loan demand 
bnc s liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds  and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of the company s liquidity 
management has a targeted range and manages its operations such that these targets can be achieved 
management believes that its prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding plan identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
the company s asset liability committee implemented a liquidity plan for the period spanning the year date change 
the company did not experience any liquidity related problems as a result of the year date change 
year issue the company implemented a year program which included the following phases awareness  assessment  renovation  testing validation and implementation the yk program 
the yk program applied to all it and non it systems  as well as any providers who service and maintain these systems 
the company managed the yk program with available staff other than a few isolated instances where consultants were engaged for a specific activity 
therefore  the company did not incur additional salary and benefits expenses related to the development and implementation of the yk program 
the company invested approximately  in hardware and software primarily for the yk lab and some non compliant computers and software which were replaced 
other yk program costs incurred were approximately  and included costs for items such as materials  supplies  postage and rental of a generator 
management s initial projection for yk program expenses was  to  all costs associated with the yk program have been funded through cash generated from operations 
while the company has remained in close communication with customers  vendors and other intermediaries  it has had no control over the remediation efforts of these third parties with whom it has material business relationships and the failure of certain of these parties to successfully remediate their year issues could potentially have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company received initial assurances from certain of these third parties that their ability to perform their obligations to the company were not expected to be materially adversely affected by the year problem 
the company also tested  to the extent possible  systems  software and interfaces through which business transactions with such third parties are effected 
management is not aware of any materially adverse circumstances related to the year remediation efforts of third parties with whom the company has material business relationships 
the company completed a contingency plan to handle its most reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios 
it did not become necessary to implement any portion of the contingency plan in response to yk related events 
all forecasts  estimates and other statements relating to the year readiness of the company and its customers and business partners have been based on information and assumptions about future events 
such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ from such statements 
these uncertainties included  but are not limited to  the understanding of the company that its core application and other systems are and will continue to be year compliant  the ability to identify  repair or replace mission critical non it equipment in a timely fashion  the ability of certain third parties to ensure their systems are year compliant and the ability of the company to test interfaces with certain of these third parties  the performance of telecommunications  data transmission and utilities providers  the failure or impairment of certain third parties with which the company transacts business  systemic occurrences in the banking industry which could impact the company s liquidity and undiscovered problems in the company s year testing plans and processes 
while the company has exercised due diligence in the development of its year plans and has taken appropriate actions based on the best available information  there can be no assurance that events and circumstances will transpire as expected and  as a result  the potential of a material adverse impact on the company cannot be completely eliminated 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company cautions readers that forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to the company s future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local economic conditions  competition for the company s customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates  risks of unanticipated and still unidentified consequences related to the impact of the year issue on the company or its customers and business partners  risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis which is mandated by generally accepted accounting principles 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on the company s earnings or value 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk can result from re pricing risk timing differences in the maturity re pricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date the company has not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
bnc s asset liability management process is utilized to manage the company s interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on current earnings and on the market value of equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining the company s interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate floors and caps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific on balance sheet transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of the company s accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
the company s primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  now  money market and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
finally  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that the company will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income 
the company monitors the results of net interest income simulation on a monthly basis at regularly scheduled asset liability management committee meetings 
each month net interest income is simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon projected 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will increase from its starting point of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will increase th of the overall increase of basis points each month 
the net interest income simulation results for the month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below 
the growth assumption used for this simulation was based on the growth projections built into the company s budget 
the impact of each interest rate scenario on projected net interest income is displayed before and after the impact of the million notional interest rate floor on the prime rate with an percent strike 
net interest income simulation amounts in thousands movement in interest rates bp bp bp unchanged bp bp bp projected month net interest income        dollar change from rates unchanged scenario  percentage change from rates unchanged scenario benefit cost from mm floor total net interest income impact with floor        dollar change from flat w floor  percentage change from unchanged w floor benefit from amortization of deferred gain on sale of interest rate swaps total net interest income impact w floor swap gain        dollar change from flat w floor swap  percentage change from flat w floor swap policy limits in september  the company purchased an interest rate floor 
the notional amount of the floor is million with a maturity date of september  the floor s reference rate is the prime rate with a strike of percent 
the company paid a premium of  or per million 
the premium is being amortized on a straight line basis over the year term of the option 
see loan portfolio interest rate floors and note and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments 
the swaps were sold in october and november gains recognized upon sale of the swaps are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the original swap contracts 
the company s rate sensitivity position over the projected twelve month horizon is liability sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected decrease of net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios  and the increase in net interest income in falling rate scenarios 
the primary reason for this interest rate risk profile is the growth of the new wealthbuilder deposit products along with the continued growth in these products that is projected into  as well as the growth and mix of components of the asset side of the balance sheet 
the company s general policy is to limit the percentage change in projected net interest income to   and from the rates unchanged scenario for the bp  bp  and bp interest rate ramp scenarios  respectively 
the company was within its policy limits for each projected scenario in the table above 
static gap analysis is another tool which may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth the company s rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash equivalents   federal funds sold   investment securities     fixed rate loans      floating rate loans     total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts   savings   time deposits under      time deposits  and over     borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities     interest rate gap      cumulative interest rate gap at december     cumulative interest rate gap to total assets investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  bnc s management believes a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
management s position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically has not caused notable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in more complex banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  this analysis is based on the company s assets and liabilities as of december  with forward adjustments for planned growth and anticipated business activities and does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
