see note to the consolidated financial statements 
tosco continues to review acquisition opportunities 
however  tosco plans to continue its disciplined approach to acquisitions  which requires an acquisition to be accretive to earnings 
results of operations are primarily determined by the operating efficiency of the refineries and by refining and retail fuel margins 
tosco expects  given reasonable margins  to operate its refineries at high levels through the balance of tosco is not able to predict the level or timing of operating margins for because of the uncertainties associated with oil markets 
in view of uncertain operating margins and highly competitive markets  tosco is committed to improving its results by becoming more efficient in all areas of operation without compromising safety  reliability  or environmental compliance 
tosco estimates that its effective income tax rate for will decrease to based on an evaluation of tosco s projected state income taxes after factoring in the exxonmobil acquisition

net cash provided by operating activities of million was from cash earnings net income plus depreciation and amortization  and other non cash operating gains and losses of million  a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily working capital of million  and other items of million 
the change in working capital reflects the increase in crude and product prices that occurred in and tosco s liquidation of lifo inventories

the decrease in availability under the revolving credit facility reflects tosco s election not to renew its million facility b under the revolving credit facility when it expired on january  at december   total shareholders equity was billion  a million increase compared to the december  balance 
this increase was due to net income of million and other items of million exceeding common stock repurchases of million and dividends of million

on february   tosco issued million of notes due in in a public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement 
at february   tosco has million remaining and available pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
in february  tosco amended and restated its revolving credit facility the amended revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amended revolving credit facility  as well as funds potentially available from the issuance of securities  provides tosco with adequate resources to meet its expected liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months  including repayment of the million notes payable on july  capital expenditures during  tosco spent million on property  plant  and equipment additions and million for turnarounds 
with the exception of certain turnarounds at the avon refinery during the stand down period  these additions were budgeted for refining additions of million were primarily for turnarounds at the avon and bayway refineries and projects related to compliance with environmental regulations and permits  personnel process safety programs  and operating flexibility and reliability projects

tosco financed the exxonmobil acquisition  including working capital  through a combination of available cash  borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility  operating lease financing  and the sale of debt securities 
risk management tosco uses a variety of strategies to reduce commodity price  interest  and operational risks 
tosco  at times and when able  uses futures and forward contracts to lock in what it believes to be favorable margins on a varying portion of refinery production by taking offsetting long obligation to buy at a certain price positions in crude oil and short obligation to deliver at a certain price positions in gasoline and heating oil 
this strategy is intended to hedge tosco s exposure to fluctuations in refining margins and therefore should tend to reduce the volatility of operating results 
in addition  tosco enters into swap contracts with counterparties to hedge sales prices of residual fuels production 
to a lesser extent  future and forward contracts may also be used to hedge inventories stored for future sale and to hedge against adverse price movements between the cost of domestic and foreign crude oil 
tosco uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its derivative instruments 
var represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
tosco estimates var across its derivative instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated using a one day interval 
tosco s measured var  using a var model with a confidence level and assuming normal market conditions at december  and  was not material 
tosco s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
the calculated var does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in tosco s holdings of derivative instruments during the year 
tosco manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
floating rate debt  primarily borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility that currently provides up to million of uncollateralized revolving credit availability  is used to finance tosco s working capital requirements 
the balance of tosco s debt is at acceptable fixed rates 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
tosco carries insurance policies on insurable risks  which it believes to be appropriate at commercially reasonable rates 
while tosco believes that it is adequately insured  future losses could exceed insurance policy limits or  under adverse interpretations  be excluded from coverage 
future costs  if any  incurred under such circumstances would have to be paid out of general corporate funds  if available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tosco s strategy to reduce credit risk 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has been less significant during recent years because of the relatively low rates experienced in the united states 
raw material  energy  and labor are important components of tosco s costs 
any or all of these components could be increased by inflation  with a possible adverse effect on profitability  especially in high inflation periods when raw material and energy cost increases generally lead finished product prices 
impact of the year issue historically  certain computer programs used two rather than four digits to define a given calendar year 
computer programs that used two digits to define the year could recognize a date using as the year rather than this practice could have resulted in business and field system failures or miscalculations that could have caused serious disruptions of operations 
this was generally referred to as the year issue 
for several years  tosco has been proactively upgrading and replacing its information systems 
in early  tosco formed a year program office to coordinate the efforts of tosco s operating units and administrative departments 
during and  tosco committed significant resources to address its year issues 
tosco has not experienced any meaningful disruptions related to the year issue 
tosco s year compliance costs included external consultants and contractors  compensation costs of internal employees working directly on year issues  purchases of software and hardware  and system upgrades and modifications which were accelerated to address the year issue 
tosco s year compliance costs did not have a material effect on its or operating results or financial position
