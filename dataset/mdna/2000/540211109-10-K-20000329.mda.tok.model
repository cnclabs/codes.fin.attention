seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors 
typically  occupancy rates are higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the growth of the company s business has required substantial amounts of capital 
the company has incurred operating and net losses due in large part to the depreciation  amortization and interest expenses related to the capital expenditures required to expand its lodging and  prior to  its residential businesses 
historically  cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to fund the cost of expanding the company s business and to service existing indebtedness

during  the company provided gicc with million to assist in the funding of gicc s operations while gicc management is in the process of selling its assets 
a commitment exists for the company to provide an additional  of funding in the first quarter of the company believes that its operating cash flows and borrowings available under the revolving loan will be sufficient to fund the company s future growth as contemplated under its current business plan  depending on the rate of the company s growth and other factors 
however  if the company s plans or assumptions change  if its assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if the company experiences unanticipated costs or competitive pressures  the company may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing  or  if such financing is available  that the company will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain additional financing  if needed  could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s expansion plans 
year information during and  the company engaged in a comprehensive review of its internal computer systems and software and external business relationships in regard to year issues 
the following information updates the company s prior disclosures related to year matters 
state of readiness

the team s objectives were to gather information and facilitate research on year issues that could affect the company  and to take necessary actions to eliminate or minimize the impact of such issues 
efforts focused on the computer hardware and software used both at its in house facilities as well as at its hotel properties 
the company completed its research and testing of internal computer hardware in the third quarter of correction or replacement of hardware and software containing year issues was completed prior to december  externally  the company worked to identify third party business relationships that had potential to be impacted by the year issue 
efforts included research and review of such relationships  including contacting the third parties to solicit information and assurances relating to potential year issues and reviewing responses 
the company has not experienced any significant year effects with its in house computer systems and facilities or its systems and equipment at its hotel customer properties 
costs associated with year incremental costs were comprised primarily of costs to purchase software upgrades  hardware  external consulting services  and subcontractor equipment installation services 
the company incurred approximately  in aggregate out of pocket costs in and to complete its year compliance program  excluding the costs of internal staffing 
such funds were provided from the company s bank credit facility 
the company does not expect to incur any additional costs related to year issues 
risks associated with year issues 
the company is highly dependent upon its own information technology systems and those of its suppliers and customers 
the company s or a third party s failure to correct a material year problem could have resulted in a failure of or interruption in the company s business activities and operations 
such interruptions and failures could have materially and adversely affect the company s results of operation  liquidity and financial condition 
no significant such failures or interruptions have been experienced 
contingency plans

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest 
at december   the company had debt totaling million 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements covering debt with a notional amount of million to effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreements 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by an estimated million 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of guest pay services in canada 
the results of operations and financial position of the company s operations in canada are measured in canadian dollars and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in canadian dollars 
the reported income of the company s canadian subsidiary will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
in addition  a portion of the company s assets are based in canada and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  the company s consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
a increase in the level of the canadian exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease of consolidated revenue of approximately  a decrease in the consolidated net loss of approximately  a decrease of consolidated assets of approximately million  and a decrease to consolidated stockholders equity of approximately
