item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc and actual events or results may differ materially 
these statements concern  among other things  the possible therapeutic applications of regeneron s product candidates and research programs  the timing and nature of the clinical and research programs now underway or planned  a variety of items described herein and in the footnotes to regeneron s financial statements including the useful life of assets  the anticipated length of agreements  and other matters  and the future uses of capital and financial needs of regeneron 
these statements are made by regeneron based on management s current beliefs and judgment 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and potential investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption factors that may affect future operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc regeneron or the company is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize therapeutic drugs for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
expanding from our initial focus on degenerative neurologic diseases  we have more recently broadened our product pipeline to include drug candidates for the treatment of obesity  rheumatoid arthritis  cancer  allergies  asthma  ischemia  and other diseases and disorders 
our ability to discover and develop product candidates for such a wide variety of serious medical conditions results from the leveraging of several powerful technology platforms  many of which were developed or enhanced by us 
in contrast to basic genomics approaches  which attempt to identify every gene in a cell or genome  we use targeted genomics and functionomics functional cloning technology platforms that are designed to discover specific genes of therapeutic interest for a particular disease or cell type 
using these approaches  we have discovered many new families of growth factors and receptors  most of which are already protected by issued patents  and which have led to several product candidates 
in cases in which the natural gene product is itself not a product candidate  we utilize our designer protein therapeutics platform to genetically engineer product candidates with the desired properties 
this technology platform has already produced more than patented proteins  several of which are in preclinical development 
the sophisticated application of all of these technology platforms  coupled with our biologic expertise in disease modeling  have allowed us to discover drug candidates that address a wide variety of important medical needs 
relative to many participants in the biotechnology and genomics industry  we are well positioned with three products in ongoing clinical trials and several product candidates planned to enter clinical trials over the next one to two years  including o axokine r second generation ciliary neurotrophic factor acts on the brain region regulating food intake and energy expenditure 
axokine is being developed for the treatment of obesity and complications of obesity such as type ii diabetes  and is now in clinical trial 
o cytokine traps antagonists for cytokines such as interleukin called il  interleukin il  interleukin il  and interleukin il 
these cytokines are thought to play a major role in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  asthma  allergic disorders  and cancer 
cytokine traps are potential treatments for these diseases  and at least one cytokine trap is expected to enter clinical trials by o vegf trap an antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor called vegf  which is required for the growth of blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow 
vegf trap is a potential treatment for cancer and is expected to enter clinical trial in o angiopoietins a new family of growth factors  discovered by us  that are specific for blood vessels and early hemopoietic stem cells 
the angiopoietins  and engineered forms of these growth factors that can act as activators and blockers  are in preclinical testing for promoting the growth of blood vessels to provide blood flow in diseased hearts and other tissues that have lost their original blood supplies  for the blocking of blood vessel growth for the treatment of cancers  for fixing leaky blood vessels that cause swelling and edema in diseases such as stroke  diabetic retinopathy  and inflammatory diseases  and for promoting the growth and mobilization of certain hemopoietic cells such as stem cells and platelets 
o brain derived neurotrophic factor promotes survival of the spinal cord neurons that die in amyotropic lateral sclerosis or als  commonly known as lou gehrig s disease  and is in clinical trial for als 
o neurotrophin  or nt acts on the neurons of the intestinal tract  and is in clinical trial for the treatment of constipating disorders 
regeneron has not received any revenues from the commercial sale of products and may never receive such revenues 
before such revenues can be realized  regeneron or its collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing its research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render regeneron s products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   regeneron had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from commercial product sales or other sources the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  regeneron s losses will continue as it conducts its research and development activities 
the company s activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and the company s operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
regeneron s losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of its research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s total revenue decreased to million in from million in  as higher contract research and development revenue and higher contract manufacturing revenue were more than offset by non recurring research progress payments and lower investment income 
contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in  as revenue from procter gamble increased to million in from million in effective in the third quarter of  research support under the p g agreement increased from million per quarter to million per quarter 
however  procter gamble payments related to axokine research declined in as axokine progressed into clinical trials and because procter gamble stopped funding axokine research in the third quarter of after it returned the product rights to axokine to the company 
regeneron also earned nominal revenue in from its ongoing collaboration with sumitomo pharmaceuticals  compared to million in  as research payments under the company s collaboration agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals ended in and because the company did not supply any bdnf to sumitomo pharmaceuticals in for preclinical and clinical use 
in addition  in regeneron received non recurring research progress payments totaling million  consisting of million from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan reduced by million of japanese withholding tax and million from procter gamble in connection with the axokine collaboration 
contract manufacturing revenue related to the long term manufacturing agreement with merck co  inc increased to million in  compared to million in  as a result of increased activity in preparation for manufacturing an intermediate for an existing merck pediatric vaccine at the company s rensselaer  new york facility 
investment income in decreased to million from million in due mainly to lower levels of interest bearing investments as the company funds its operations 
the company s total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in the company s preclinical and clinical research programs 
the loss in amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in as a result of the partnership s increased clinical trial activity on bdnf and nt research and development expenses including loss in amgen regeneron partners were of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in patent expenses related to us and foreign patent filings and higher administrative staffing 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from improvements made to the company s leased research facilities and offices in tarrytown  new york 
contract manufacturing expenses  which relate directly to the merck agreement  decreased to million in from million in during the fourth quarter of  the united states food and drug administration approved regeneron as a contract manufacturer for the merck intermediate  and the company commenced commercial production and began capitalizing manufacturing costs into inventory 
this resulted in a decrease in contract manufacturing expenses  as the company discontinued the expensing of pre commercial production costs and began capitalizing inventory costs 
the company s net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in years ended december  and the company s total revenue rose to million in from million in  as contract research and development revenue  research progress payments  contract manufacturing revenue  and investment income all increased 
contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in  as higher revenue related to the p g agreement more than offset a decrease in revenue from the company s ongoing collaboration with sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
in  research progress payments of million consisted of a payment of million from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan reduced by million of japanese withholding tax and a payment of million from procter gamble in connection with the axokine collaboration 
in  research progress payments of million were received from procter gamble in connection with the september amendment to the p g agreement related to axokine 
contract manufacturing revenue related to the merck manufacturing agreement increased to million in compared to million in as a result of increased activity in preparation for manufacturing a product for merck at the company s rensselaer facility 
investment income in increased to million from million in  due mainly to higher levels of interest bearing investments resulting primarily from the proceeds of a private placement of equity securities with procter gamble in june the company s total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in the company s preclinical and clinical research programs 
the loss in amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in  due to lower research and development expenses by the partnership 
research and development expenses including loss in amgen regeneron partners were approximately of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expenses were million in both and depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in  as certain laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements became fully depreciated 
contract manufacturing expenses  which are expenses directly related to the merck agreement and are reimbursed by merck  increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased activity in preparation for manufacturing a product for merck 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in as the amount of outstanding obligations in connection with capital leases declined 
the company s net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has financed its operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of its equity securities  revenue earned under agreements between the company and amgen  sumitomo chemical company  ltd  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  and procter gamble and investment income 
in may  regeneron and procter gamble entered into the p g agreement 
procter gamble agreed over the first five years of the p g agreement to purchase up to million in regeneron equity of which million was purchased in june and provide up to million in support of regeneron s research efforts related to the collaboration of which million was received through december  
during the second five years of the p g agreement  the companies will share all research costs equally 
clinical testing and commercialization expenses for jointly developed products will generally be shared equally throughout the ten years of the collaboration 
the companies expect jointly to develop and market worldwide any products resulting from the collaboration and share equally in profits 
either company may terminate the p g agreement at the end of five years with at least one year prior notice or earlier if a defined event of default occurs 
in september  the company and procter gamble expanded the p g agreement to include axokine and related molecules delivered systemically  and agreed to develop axokine initially to treat obesity associated with type ii diabetes 
procter gamble agreed to reimburse the company for certain research and development costs and made research progress payments to regeneron of million in both and in part due to the achievement of certain milestones related to axokine 
during the third quarter of  procter gamble returned product rights to axokine to regeneron and is not expected to make further payments to regeneron related to axokine 
the decision by procter gamble to terminate the joint development of axokine has no effect on the broader ten year collaborative p g agreement under which  beginning in the third quarter of  research support from procter gamble  aside from amounts related to axokine  increased from million per quarter to at least million per quarter through june in connection with regeneron s agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  sumitomo pharmaceuticals paid the company million through december the company also received a million research progress payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals reduced by million of japanese withholding tax in august in addition  sumitomo pharmaceuticals has paid the company million through december  in connection with supplying bdnf for preclinical and clinical use 
regeneron did not supply any bdnf to sumitomo pharmaceuticals in during the fourth quarter of  regeneron commenced production of bdnf and began capitalizing manufacturing costs into inventory 
the company resumed supplying bdnf to sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the first quarter of the company s activities relating to bdnf and nt  as agreed upon by amgen and regeneron  are being reimbursed by amgen regeneron partners  and the company recognizes such reimbursement as revenue 
the funding of amgen regeneron partners is through capital contributions from amgen and regeneron  who must make equal payments in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from the partnership 
the company has made capital contributions totaling million to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  these contributions could increase or decrease  depending upon among other things the nature and cost of bdnf and nt studies that amgen regeneron partners may conduct and the outcomes of those studies 
from its inception in january through december   the company invested approximately million in property  plant  and equipment 
this includes million to acquire and renovate the rensselaer facility and an additional million to complete construction at the facility pursuant to the merck agreement 
in connection with the purchase and renovation of the rensselaer facility  the company obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation  of which million is outstanding 
under the terms of this udc financing  the company is not permitted to declare or pay dividends on its equity securities 
the company expects that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
the company is currently involved in interference proceedings in the patent and trademark office between regeneron s patent applications and patents relating to cntf issued to synergen  inc amgen acquired all outstanding shares of synergen in in march  the company and amgen entered into a covenant not to sue each other which  among other things  provided a simple mechanism for resolving their patent interference and related patent proceedings relating to cntf and axokine without protracted litigation 
the company also granted amgen a license to use cntf and second generation cntfs other than axokine to treat retinal degenerative conditions 
regeneron will not pay royalties or make other payments to the other party in consideration of this agreement 
as of december   the company had no established banking arrangements through which it could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
additional funds may be raised through  among other things  the issuance of additional securities  other financing arrangements  and future collaboration agreements 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  the company estimates that through mid it could receive additional payments from procter gamble in the form of research funding and equity purchases of as much as million or more 
at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
the company expects to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  validation of manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment 
the company expects to incur ongoing funding requirements for capital contributions to amgen regeneron partners to support the continued development and clinical trials of bdnf and nt through  the company expects further increases in the level of quarterly research and development expenses as the company continues to add staff and increases its clinical activity 
the amount needed to fund operations will also depend on other factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of the company s research and development programs  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights developments  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research programs including those with amgen and procter gamble 
the company believes that under its current strategy its existing capital resources will enable it to meet operating needs for several years 
no assurance can be given that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to the company s capital being consumed significantly before such time 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards management believes that the future adoption of recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements  except that the company is currently evaluating the future impact that staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  issued in december by the securities and exchange commission  will have on its financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results regeneron cautions stockholders and potential investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  regeneron s actual results and could cause regeneron s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  regeneron 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose o delay  difficulty  or failure of the company s research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by the company or others 
o cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements including in particular  but not limited to  those with procter gamble and amgen and the resulting loss of research or other funding could have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
a change of control of one or more of the company s material collaborators or licensees could also have a material adverse effect on the company 
o delay  difficulty  or failure of a clinical trial of any of the company s product candidates 
a clinical trial can fail or be delayed as a result of many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
o in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by regeneron s drug candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical experiments and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been successfully completed 
patients who have been treated with axokine  bdnf  and nt have developed antibodies  though we have no information that indicates that these antibodies are neutralizing antibodies 
o delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval including approval of its facilities for production for the company s products including vaccine intermediate for merck  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy 
o increased and irregular costs of development  manufacture  regulatory approval  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
o competitive or market factors that may cause use of the company s products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
o the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
o difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to meet the company s obligations under its collaboration and licensing agreements or to fund percent of the cost of developing product candidates in order to retain percent of the commercialization rights 
o amount and rate of growth of regeneron s general and administrative expenses  and the impact of unusual charges resulting from regeneron s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies and organizational structure 
o failure of corporate partners to develop or commercialize successfully the company s products or to retain and expand the markets served by the commercial collaborations  conflicts of interest  priorities  and commercial strategies which may arise between regeneron and its corporate partners 
o delays or difficulties in developing and acquiring production technology and technical and managerial personnel to manufacture novel biotechnology products in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
o difficulties in obtaining key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of the company s product candidates 
o the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil  such as product or employment related  or environmental  or criminal  settlements and investigations  developments or assertions by or against regeneron relating to intellectual property rights and licenses  the issuance and use of patents and proprietary technology by regeneron and its competitors  including the possible negative effect on the company s ability to develop  manufacture  and sell its products in circumstances where it is unable to obtain licenses to patents which may be required for such products 
o underutilization of the company s existing or new manufacturing facilities or of any facility expansions  resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs  start up costs  inefficiencies  delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions 
o health care reform  including reductions or changes in reimbursement available for prescription medications or other reforms 
o the ability to attract and retain key personnel 
as regeneron s scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of regeneron s current areas of experience and expertise  the company will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which it currently does not have substantial resources and personnel 
year the company has evaluated its operations to determine the impact  if any  that year problems might have 
the year problem results from computer programs and devices that do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year like many corporations  regeneron has no previous experience with an issue like the year problem 
the company appointed a year task force with representatives from each department of the company and retained independent consultants and experts to facilitate its review 
the company s year review included its computer systems and software  embedded systems in non computer equipment  and vendor operations 
the company identified the following three principal areas of potential computer systems exposure at regeneron to the year problem  in addition to third party issues which are discussed elsewhere o process control  instruments  and environmental monitoring and control systems these types of systems are used in the company s manufacturing and research and development processes  among other operations 
these generally are systems  devices  and instruments which use date functionality and generate  send  receive  or manipulate date stamped data and signals 
these systems may be found in data acquisition processing software  laboratory instrumentation  and other equipment with embedded code  for example 
these devices and instruments may be controlled by installed software  firmware  or other embedded control algorithms 
o servers  desktops  and infrastructure these generally are desktop computers macintosh and pcs and server computer equipment  telecommunications  local area networks  wide area networks  and include system hardware  firmware  installed commercial application software  e mail  and video teleconferencing  for example 
o custom applications and business systems these generally are applications purchased from an external vendor 
these systems include applications developed or purchased by a functional area on computer systems located within regeneron s corporate departments and operated by departmental personnel  such as regeneron s core business systems including financial systems and personnel management systems 
the company has completed an analysis of its computer systems 
this analysis did not reveal material year problems related to such embedded systems 
prior to december   the company completed a survey and analysis of its vendors who support critical business processes to determine their level of readiness with respect to year issues 
while many vendors indicated that they believed they were year compliant  others stated that they could not represent that they had achieved compliance or guarantee the efficacy of their remediation efforts 
many vendors stated that the problem was too complex for such a claim to have legitimacy  that efforts to solve year problems were merely in the nature of risk mitigation  and that success in such efforts would be measured  with hindsight  by the minimization of the level of technical failures and by the prompt identification and repair of failures 
since december   the company has not experienced year issues with its vendors who support critical business processes 
the analysis of the company s embedded systems and the information collected regarding vendor readiness were used to formulate a contingency plan with respect to reasonably identifiable items of equipment and materials that are critical to the company s operations 
this contingency plan is still in effect and would be utilized if any problems were to arise during the year or beyond 
no assurance can be made that the company s computer systems and software  embedded systems in non computer equipment  and vendors will not experience any problems in the future related to year issues 
the failure of certain third parties such as procter gamble  amgen  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  vendors and utility and communications companies to operate in a normal and customary manner and to maintain year compliance or to assure that their vendors and suppliers are year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of regeneron 
it is possible that regeneron could be adversely affected by the failure of other third parties to be year compliant even though these third parties do not directly conduct business with regeneron 
it is not possible to guarantee that the company s year contingency plan would succeed or be timely 
prior to december   regeneron developed a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario and identified the principal risks to regeneron 
in developing this scenario  regeneron assumed  among other things  that any year disruptions were likely to be of limited duration and that extended material year related disruptions could not be reasonably guarded against based on the resources and nature of operations of the company 
the company implemented contingency plans to protect certain key regeneron assets in the event of a failure of electrical power for a limited duration or unanticipated failure of certain essential equipment 
the risks that year problems could have presented to the company include  without limitation  disruption  delay  or cessation of manufacturing or other operations  including operations that are subject to regulatory compliance  and loss of research and manufacturing material and experiments that are difficult  costly  or impossible to replace 
as of december   total expenditures incurred related to the company s year efforts  including  without limitation  back up generators  computer system upgrades  remediation  and new computer systems  internal staff costs and outside consulting fees are million  primarily for capital expenditures 
future projected expenditures related to the company s year program are not expected to be significant 
the company has not experienced any problems as a result of year concerns 
the statements concerning the year problem which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
there can be no guarantee that any estimates or other forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those planned or contemplated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
the company does not believe it is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under its current policies the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
