the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december to april 
the impact of seasonality may be reduced somewhat in the future as keystone becomes more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the reduced number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  general economic conditions that affect consumer spending  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for funds has been to finance the growth of inventory and accounts receivable and to complete acquisitions 
at march   working capital was million compared to million at march  the decrease in working capital is primarily the result of a decrease in cash coupled with an increase in inventory

the company believes that its existing working capital  estimated cash flow from operations and funds available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations and stock repurchases for at least the next months 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under its credit facility  where interest rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current levels of debt  the exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations  primarily with respect to its product purchases in taiwan 
while all transactions with taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and new taiwan dollars might impact the price of products purchased in taiwan 
the company might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
under its present policies  the company does not attempt to hedge its currency exchange rate exposure
