all others programs have been terminated by the customer or the company 
such terminations did not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
sales of existing battery types did not increase as expected in due to delays in orders from lockheed martin and others testing the battery for use in new products in emerging markets

battery packs are being tested simultaneously with other newly designed components in customer products 
revenue the company generated project revenue of approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

however  chrysler s purchase of a significant number of batteries from the company in the future is uncertain 
approximately  and of  and battery sales  respectively  were to lockheed martin for use in hevs and evs they are producing for fleet consumers for testing and evaluation 
sales of batteries to lockheed martin are expected to increase in lockheed martin produces a drive train used in hybrid buses manufactured by the orion bus company and others

the company has approximately  of outstanding accounts payable  most of which is payable to raw material suppliers and service providers  some of which is considerably past due 
cash generated from battery sales and contracts with other customers is not sufficient to fund operations 
cash payments from kamkorp and its affiliates to date have been sufficient to fund ongoing operations  but not to pay the outstanding accounts payable or raw material purchases 
if a significant battery order is received  significant funding will be required to pay the outstanding accounts payable and to order raw materials 
the company is discussing the possibility of accelerated or additional financing from kamkorp including kamkorp s exercise of its option to purchase the remaining options to purchase  shares the original agreement to purchase  shares  plus options to purchase an additional  shares  less shares purchased as of december  of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
absent additional funding from kamkorp or other sources  the company will not have the funds necessary to complete battery orders from kamkorp affiliates or other customers  or to pay all outstanding obligations and will not be able to continue as a going concern 
the company s common stock is traded in the over the counter market and is reported on the nasdaq stock markets nasdaq 
in order to maintain listing by nasdaq under rules which went into effect in february  the company must maintain a minimum  of net tangible assets total assets  excluding goodwill  minus total liabilities and the company s closing price cannot fall below per share for consecutive trade dates 
on february   the company received written notice from nasdaq that the closing bid price of its shares fell below for consecutive business days and therefore did not meet the nasdaq minimum listing requirements 
the written notification stated that within days of the notification  the company s closing bid price must be or higher for ten consecutive calendar days to satisfy the requirement 
this requirement was met by mid february as of march   the company s net tangible assets were less than  as a result  the company was not in compliance with the minimum listing requirements of nasdaq and advised nasdaq of that fact 
on april   the company received notice from nasdaq that it was concerned that the company may not be able to sustain compliance with the continued listing requirements of nasdaq in light of the going concern opinion from its independent auditor 
to address this concern nasdaq requested a detailed letter from the company  discussing the timeline for resolution of these items and a discussion explaining why the company believes it will be able to sustain compliance with the continued listing standards of nasdaq 
the company complied with this request on april  additionally  on may   the company received notice that since the company failed to meet the requirement for net tangible assets of million on the march  form q  the company would be required to submit before june   a proposal for achieving compliance 
this proposal was submitted june  the nasdaq staff responded to both of these issues in a letter dated july  the staff reviewed the company s plan for regaining and maintaining compliance and stated while the staff has determined that the company will not be delisted due to its previously cited failures to comply  they have determined to apply more stringent reporting requirements 
the company was required to submit an internal balance sheet and statement of operations for the period ended july  by august  thereafter  until further notice  the company will be required to submit by the th of each month  an internal balance sheet and statement of operations for the preceding month s end 
the company has complied with this requirement to date 
the company is required to keep nasdaq apprised of all material events and any changes in its financial statements 
should the company fail to maintain million net tangible assets  the staff will issue a formal delisting letter to the company 
if the company does not continue to maintain the required listing criteria  it is likely that the company s shares would be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market at a time specified by nasdaq  in which event the shares would be quoted on the over the counter otc bulletin board and or the pink sheets of the national quotation board nqb 
in such trading markets  brokers and dealers effecting trades in the common stock would become subject to the securities and exchange commission rules covering trading in penny stocks 
becoming subject to the penny stock rules would likely have a material adverse effect on both the price and trading liquidity of the company s common stock 
if the company were delisted from nasdaq  it would likely be more difficult to obtain additional funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funding which will generate sufficient cash to sustain operations can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern
