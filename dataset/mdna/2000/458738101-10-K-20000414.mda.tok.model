the company s efforts are focused on genetic factors that affect the rate of progression of clinical disease through their influence on common host systems 
the company s first genetic test  pst r  a test predictive of risk for periodontal disease  is currently marketed in the united states  europe and israel 
products under development include tests predictive of risk for osteoporosis  coronary artery disease  diabetic retinopathy  asthma  pulmonary fibrosis and meningitis sepsis 
the company believes by combining genetic risk assessment with specific therapeutic strategies  improved clinical outcomes and more cost effective management of these common diseases are achieved 
ilgn also develops and licenses its medical research tools  including biofusion r  to pharmaceutical companies 
biofusion  a proprietary enabling system for diagnostic and drug discovery and development  is a computer modeling system that integrates genetic and other sub cellular behavior  system functions  and clinical symptoms to simulate complex diseases 
this system allows for the utilization of the rapidly increasing databases of gene expression  cell biology  prognostic  pharmacogenomic and predictive medicine databases being generated in companies and academic centers worldwide 
the company has followed a strategy of working with strategic partners at the fundamental discovery stage 
this strategy has given the company access to discoveries while reducing up front research expenses 
since  the company has had a strategic alliance with the department of molecular and genetic medicine at sheffield university in the united kingdom sheffield 
under this alliance  sheffield has provided to the company the fundamental discovery and genetic analysis from sheffield s research laboratories and the company has focused on product development  including clinical trials  and the commercialization of these discoveries 
in october  the company entered into a new arrangement the agreement with sheffield replacing the research and development agreement that had been in place with sheffield since under the agreement  the company will undertake the development and commercialization of certain discoveries resulting from sheffield s research 
the agreement with sheffield is a five year agreement with an automatic yearly renewal 
pursuant to this new arrangement  the company issued an aggregate of  shares of its common stock to sheffield and its investigators in exchange for the transfer of certain patent rights and the relinquishment of proceeds interests held by sheffield and its investigators under all project agreements 
the company also entered into a research and development services agreement with sheffield which automatically renews in one year increments

no assurances can be made regarding the commercial acceptance of pst 
the company anticipates additional international agreements for the distribution of pst in  but no assurances can be made that such agreements will be entered into by the company 
the company has been awarded four us patents  and has sixteen us patent applications pending 
the us patent trademark office awarded patents to the company for its osteoporosis and periodontal disease susceptibility tests and two patent awards for its biologic modeling technology called biofusion r  which is used by the company in the discovery  development and commercialization process 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to higher average selling price per pst test 
cost of revenues was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same year period in  representing a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to lower laboratory costs for processing pst tests 
for the year ended december   the company had research and development expenses of  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to  of non cash expense associated with issuance of  shares of common stock to the university of sheffield and its investigators in conjunction with the new arrangement with sheffield and its investigators entered into in october selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for to  from  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease reflects the reduction in personnel costs as the company shifted from an internal sales staff to the use of outside distributors to sell its pst tests 
interest income decreased to  in from  in this decrease is attributable to the reduction in the unused net proceeds of the initial public offering and subsequent private placements as the proceeds are used for ongoing company operations and a  reduction in the company s debt obligations

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to sales of pst  the company s first genetic test which was made commercially available in the fourth quarter of cost of revenues was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in  representing an increase of 
this increase is a result of the increase in sales  offset by the company s ability to take advantage of volume processing discounts provided to it by its outside laboratory vendors 
for the year ended december   the company had research and development expenses of  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to our continued investment in genetic research projects 
in addition to the full time employment of key scientists for our coronary artery disease and osteoporosis genetic susceptibility tests  and for new clinical trials which have commenced and are continuing to run for the same two tests  the company continues to perform science enhancement studies for our pst product  as well as invest in our previously disclosed research projects related to diabetic retinopathy and asthma 
one additional factor in the increase of research and development expenses  as discussed above  is the write down of capitalized patent expenses 
the resulting charge  taken in the fourth quarter of  was  or  of research and development expenses for the year 
management believes it is appropriate to expense these costs after consideration of their current development strategy and available capital 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for to  from  for  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to building the infrastructure required to support commercial operations and the increased marketing and sales efforts required to support the company s genetic susceptibility testing business 
additionally  general and administrative expenses increased to support the research and development efforts of the company  and due to increased legal and accounting expenses related to complying with sec reporting obligations 
during the second quarter of  the company consolidated its corporate headquarters from newport beach  california into the company s san antonio research facility 
as a result of this relocation  the company amended its existing lease in san antonio to extend the term and expand its premises 
the amended lease expires on may  and extends its square footage from approximately  square feet to  square feet

liquidity and capital resources the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents are the most significant indicators of the company s liquidity position 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  the cash and cash equivalents position generated interest income of  in the fourth quarter of  and  for the year 
net cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december  as compared to  used during marketable securities increased from zero in to  at december  as the company purchased us treasury notes with the unused proceeds from the private placement of  of convertible preferred stock in june accounts payable decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to the decreased level of operating expenses in late additionally  the company entered into an agreement with a distributor whereby the distributor paid in advance for licensing fees  resulting in prepaid distributor fees increasing from zero in to  in the current portion of long term debt decreased from  in to zero in due to the company s retirement of all outstanding debt in the company s investing activities used cash of  in the year ended december  and provided cash of  in during the year ended december   the company shifted excess cash from cash and cash equivalents into marketable securities to earn a preferred interest rate 
additionally  during  the company received proceeds from the maturity of investments of  as a result of the maturity of us treasury bills previously invested in  partially offset by reinvestment in a certificate of deposit 
investing activities were comprised primarily from the maturing of investments and a certificate of deposit and the purchase of investments 
financing activities provided  in and used  in during  the company received  in net proceeds for the issuance of convertible preferred stock and  in proceeds for the issuance of common stock  as compared to  for common stock issued in in  the company received proceeds from long term borrowings of  as compared to  in in january of  the company received  in net proceeds from a private placement of  shares of common stock 
the company currently does not have any commitments for material capital expenditures 
the company s obligation at december  for capitalized lease obligations totaled  of which  is classified as long term and  is classified as current 
the company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated interest income and revenue  will be sufficient to conduct its operations as planned until september however  the company s future capital requirements are anticipated to be substantial  and the company does not have commitments for additional capital at this time 
such capital requirements are expected to arise from the commercial launch of additional genetic tests  continued marketing and sales efforts for pst  continued research and development efforts  the protection of the company s intellectual property rights including preparing and filing of patent applications  as well as operational  administrative  legal and accounting expenses 
the company plans to raise capital through equity and or debt issuance when  and if  such capital is available to it 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise any additional necessary capital 
if additional amounts cannot be raised  the company would suffer material adverse consequences to its business  financial condition and results of operations and would likely be required to seek protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of securities of u 
s treasury notes 
the securities held in the company s investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of these securities 
after a review of the company s marketable securities as of december   the company has determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of the company s marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements as a whole
