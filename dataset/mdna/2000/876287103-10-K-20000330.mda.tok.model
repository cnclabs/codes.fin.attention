overall occupancy levels for commercial properties held in both years remained relatively stable in compared to for properties held in both years  interest expense increased million due to long term and interim mortgage financing  including advances under revolving credit facilities  which increased mortgage loans by million during and for properties held in both years  depreciation expense increased million 
an increase of million resulted from the reclassification of nine properties from held for sale to held for investment  including adjustments to record depreciation expense for the period during which they were classified as held for sale 
a decrease of million resulted from ceasing depreciation of six properties in and two properties in upon their reclassification to held for sale 
the remaining increase is primarily due to the depreciation of capital improvements made in and equity in income loss of partnerships was  higher in compared to several partnerships own properties that were under construction or in lease up in and achieved stabilized operations in those properties contributed  to the increased income 
a decline of almost million came from pennsylvania avenue  where income in included  resulting from refinancing of the property 
debt service requirements on the new loan were responsible for the remaining decrease in income in because tarragon acquired tarragon realty advisors in  we no longer pay advisory fees 
the advisory fee was an incentive fee of of adjusted funds from operations  as defined in the advisory agreement 
tarragon now pays costs previously borne by its advisor instead of paying advisory fees  property management fees  and acquisition and refinancing fees that were paid under the advisory agreement 
this accounts for the bulk of the million increase in general and administrative expenses 
during  tarragon recognized gains totaling million on the sale of five properties  portions of two other properties  and its share of the gain on the sale of one of its joint venture properties

allowance for estimated losses and provisions for losses tarragon periodically reviews the carrying values of properties held for sale 
generally accepted accounting principles require the carrying value of a property held for sale not to exceed the lower of its cost or its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
in instances where a property s estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than its carrying value at the time of evaluation  we provide an allowance for loss by making a charge against operations 
our review of properties held for sale generally includes selective site inspections  comparing the property s current rents to market rents  reviewing the property s expenses and maintenance requirements  discussions with the property manager  and a review of the surrounding area 
we may make adjustments to estimated fair value based on future reviews 
tarragon also evaluates its properties held for investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a property s carrying value may not be recoverable 
this evaluation generally consists of reviewing the property s cash flow and current and projected market conditions  as well as changes in general and local economic conditions 
if we conclude that a property has been impaired  we reduce its carrying value by making a charge against current earnings in the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
environmental matters under federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  tarragon may be liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as other costs such as fines or injuries to persons and property where our employees may have arranged for removal  disposal  or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties can seek recovery from tarragon for personal injury associated with those materials 
we are not aware of any liability relating to these matters that would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  or results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued tax matters for the through tax years  we have elected and  in our opinion  qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  as that term is defined in sections through of the internal revenue code of a reit is required to distribute at least of its reit taxable income  plus of its net income from foreclosure property  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  on an annual basis to stockholders 
we have terminated our status as a reit effective as of december   the beginning of our tax year  but we do not expect this to impact our current policy of paying annual dividends to common stockholders in an amount not greater than of funds from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tarragon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   tarragon had approximately million of variable rate debt 
the primary base rate is the day libor 
using this balance of debt  if libor or any other indexes on which the rates are based increased by basis points  our pre tax earnings and cash flows would decrease by approximately million 
on the other hand  if interest rates decreased by basis points  our pre tax earnings and cash flows would increase by approximately million 
at december   unconsolidated partnerships had approximately million of variable rate debt 
a basis point increase in the index on which the rates are based would reduce our pre tax earnings by approximately  based on our interests in the partnerships 
a basis point decrease in the index on which the rates are based would increase our pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming these partnerships distribute all of their available cash to the partners  our cash flow would be changed by these same amounts 
tarragon has entered into reverse repurchase agreements with an investment bank for three mortgage backed securities  or mbss  secured separately by mortgages on three of our properties 
if market interest rates increase  the value of the mbss generally decreases  which would require us to deposit more funds with the investment bank assuming no change in margin requirements 
decreases in market interest rates generally increase the value of the mbss and allow the release to us of margin funds held by the investment bank again assuming no change in margin requirements 
the repurchase price of the mbss bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a decrease of  in our pre tax earnings and a decrease of million in our cash flow 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of  in our pre tax earnings and an increase of million in our cash flow
