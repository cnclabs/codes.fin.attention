in connection with the smart acquisition  we incurred expenses of million that included  among other things  investment  legal and accounting fees and expenses 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our financial statements include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of smart for all periods presented 
all share and per share amounts in this form k have been adjusted to reflect a two for one stock split of our common stock effected as a dividend on february  recent developments on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire aspect development  inc aspect  a developer of collaborative solutions for business to business marketplaces 
pursuant to the agreement  we will exchange all of the outstanding capital stock of aspect and will assume all outstanding stock options of aspect  for approximately million shares of our common stock and options 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase  is subject to regulatory and i and aspect stockholder approvals  and is expected to close in the third quarter of this year

under the agreement  we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock and stock options of supplybase 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase  is subject to regulatory approval and supplybase stockholder approval  and is expected to close in the second quarter of this year 
these strategic acquisitions will result in substantial one time charges along with ongoing substantial amortization of intangibles to our earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenues software licenses services maintenance total revenues costs and expenses cost of software licenses cost of services and maintenance sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development and acquisition related expenses total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss revenues our revenues consist of software license revenues  service revenues and maintenance revenues 
software license revenues consist of sales of software licenses which  for periods subsequent to december   are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a contract and delivery of software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
for periods prior to december   software license revenues were recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  software license revenues were recognized upon execution of a contract and shipment of the software  provided that no significant vendor obligations remained outstanding  amounts were due within one year and collection was considered probable by management 
the application of sop did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in  software license revenues were recognized in accordance with sop  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
service revenues primarily are derived from fees for implementation  consulting and training services and are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with initial license sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance 
total revenues increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in we derive substantially all of our revenues from licenses associated with our rhythm suite of software products  as well as related services and maintenance 
software licenses 
revenues from software licenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in software license revenues constituted of total revenues in  in and in the increases in the dollar amount of software license revenues were due to increased customer awareness of the potential benefits derived from deploying our software solutions 
to date  sales of software licenses have been derived principally from direct sales to customers 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of software license revenues  our strategy is to increase the level of indirect sales activities 
we expect that sales of our software products through sales alliances  distributors  resellers and other indirect channels will increase as a percentage of software license revenues 
however  our efforts to expand indirect sales may not be successful  or these relationships may not continue in the future 
services 
revenues from services increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in services revenues constituted of total revenues in  in  and in the increases in the dollar amount of services revenues were due primarily to an increase in the number of rhythm licenses sold and a significant investment in our consulting organization as a result of the increased demand for our solutions 
the increases also were due to an increase in the use of third party consultants to provide implementation services to our customers  which has allowed us to more rapidly penetrate international markets 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate  on a period to period basis based upon the demand for implementation  training and consulting services 
maintenance 
revenues from maintenance increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in maintenance revenues constituted of total revenues in  in and in the increases in the dollar amount of maintenance revenues were primarily due to the continued increase in the number of rhythm licenses sold and a high percentage of maintenance agreement renewals 
we expect that maintenance revenues both in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues will continue to increase from the levels achieved in concentration of revenues 
in  one customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
while on an annual basis no individual customer accounted for more than of total revenues in or  we generally derive a significant portion of our software license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large sales 
for example  in each quarter of  in the last three quarters of and in each quarter of  one or more customers individually accounted for at least of total software license revenues during that quarter 
while we believe that the loss of any one of these customers would not seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition  our inability to consummate one or more substantial license sales in any future period could seriously harm our operating results for that period 
international revenues 
we recognized million of revenues from international sources in  representing approximately of total revenues  million in  representing approximately of total revenues  and million in  representing approximately of total revenues 
our revenues from international sources were generated primarily from customers located in asia  canada and europe 
revenues generated from the european region in  and were  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in revenues from international sources as a percentage of total revenues in was due primarily to increased levels of sales execution from our international sales force and management team 
we believe that continued growth and profitability may require further expansion in international markets 
to increase the level of international sales  we have utilized and may continue to utilize substantial resources to expand existing international operations and establish additional international operations 
we cannot be certain that our investments in international operations will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability 
costs and expenses cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of commissions paid to third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements  royalty fees associated with third party software included with sales of rhythm  the cost of user documentation  and the cost of reproduction and delivery of the software 
cost of software licenses was million in  representing of software license revenues  million in  representing of software license revenues  and million in  representing of software license revenues 
the increases in cost of software licenses were due primarily to an increase in commissions to third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements and the amount of royalty fees associated with third party software included with sales of rhythm 
we expect the cost of software licenses to vary in the future depending upon the level of third party services 
cost of services and maintenance 
cost of services and maintenance was million in  representing of total services and maintenance revenues  million in  representing of total services and maintenance revenues  and million in  representing of total services and maintenance revenues 
the dollar increases in cost of services and maintenance were due to an increase in the number of consultants  product support and training staff and the increased use of third party consultants to provide implementation services 
in addition  consulting and support centers were established and expanded in europe  canada and asia in recent years 
we expect to continue to increase the number of our consulting  product support and training personnel in the foreseeable future as a means to maintain and strengthen our position in different geographic and vertical markets 
consequently  the cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of total services and maintenance revenues may increase in the future 
to the extent that our revenues do not increase at anticipated rates  the hiring of additional personnel could seriously harm our profit margins 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  representing of total revenues  million in  representing of total revenues  and million in  representing of total revenues 
the increases in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses were due to continued expansion of our direct sales force  increased sales commissions as a result of the higher revenue levels  continued investment in strengthening our international selling presence and increased marketing and promotional activities as a result of our expanded suite of intelligent ebusiness solutions 
we expect these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  representing of total revenues  million in  representing of total revenues  and million in  representing of total revenues 
the increases in the dollar amount of research and development expenses were due to the hiring of additional research and development personnel and other related costs incurred to support our growing solution footprint 
we expect that the dollar amount of research and development expenses will increase as we continue to invest in developing new products  applications and product enhancements for existing products and intelligent ebusiness solutions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
to date  the establishment of technological feasibility of our products and general release of such software have substantially coincided 
as a result  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant and we have not capitalized any software development costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  representing of total revenues  million in  representing of total revenues  and million in  representing of total revenues 
the increases in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses were primarily the result of increased staffing and related costs associated with the growth of our business 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to the increase in revenues and our ability to leverage our base of resources to support a larger organization 
we expect that the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
in process research and development and acquisition related expenses 
in the recent past  we have sought to expand the depth of our current product offerings through various technology or business acquisitions 
some of these acquisitions involve technology that is not yet determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its then current stage of development 
in such instances  in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines  the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development is expensed immediately upon acquisition 
further  the final purchase price on certain transactions is ultimately dependent upon certain events such as payouts based on the attainment of specified revenue targets for the acquired products or technologies 
such future earnouts  if any  may be considered as additional costs to acquire the company 
we acquired smart in  intertrans logistics solutions limited  or itls  in and think systems corporation and optimax systems corporation in these acquisitions were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of these companies 
additionally  in  and  we completed other business acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method 
we incurred million in  million in and million in in certain acquisition related expenses  of which million in  million in and million in represented the write off of in process research and development 
the remaining costs primarily consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees and expenses and amortization of intangibles 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other income  net other income  net was million in  representing of total revenues  million in  representing of total revenues  and million in  representing of total revenues 
other income  net includes interest income  interest expense and bank fees  foreign currency gains and losses and miscellaneous income 
included in other income  net for was a gain of million on the sale of smart s hosting business 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in  million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in  in and in the fluctuations in our effective income tax rates were primarily due to the non deductibility of certain subsidiaries losses and the in process research and development and certain other acquisition related expenses 
excluding the effects of certain subsidiaries losses  the in process research and development and certain other acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate was in  in and in net income per share net income per share is calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share 
this method requires calculation of both net income per share and net income per share  assuming dilution 
net income per share excludes the potentially dilutive effect of common stock equivalents such as stock options  while net income per share  assuming dilution includes such potentially dilutive effects 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations could be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises  the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase program  any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the net income per share  assuming dilution computation  the issuance of common stock to effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions  the issuance of common stock or warrants to effect joint marketing  joint development  or other such arrangements should we enter into such transactions  and assumed or actual conversions of debt into common stock with respect to the convertible notes issued in december liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and sales of debt and equity securities 
our liquidity and financial position consisted of million of working capital at december   as compared to million at december  the increases in working capital were primarily related to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to the net proceeds from our convertible note offering in december of million 
cash flows from operations were million in  million in and million in operating cash flows increased in as compared to and increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in net income  deferred revenues  accrued liabilities and the tax benefit from stock option activity 
the tax benefit from stock option activity is primarily the result of disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under our stock plans 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to strong fourth quarter revenues in days sales outstanding was days and days for the quarter ending december  and the year ending december   respectively 
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding can fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the amount and timing of revenues earned  our collection experience  negotiated payment terms  the amount of receivables generated from international customers which generally have longer payment terms compared to customers in the us  and the number of large sales for which some amounts may not be due upon execution of the contract 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is adequate to cover any collection difficulties with respect to accounts receivable 
however  a significant portion of our accounts receivable are derived from sales of large licenses  often to new customers with whom we do not have a payment history 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance will be adequate to cover any receivables that are later determined to be uncollectible  particularly if one or more large receivables become uncollectible 
cash used in investing activities  primarily for capital expenditures and short term investments  was million for as compared to million for and million for cash used in investing activities was higher in primarily due to the january investment of the net proceeds from our public offering at the end of  at which time the proceeds were invested primarily in financial instruments classified as cash equivalents 
at december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was million for as compared to million for and million for cash provided by financing activities for includes the net proceeds of million from our convertible note offering in december cash provided by financing activities for includes the net proceeds of million from our public offering of common stock at the end of on december   we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of our convertible subordinated notes due  which were sold at par less an underwriting discount of of the principal amount of the notes 
the net proceeds of this offering  after giving effect to discounts  commissions  premiums and expenses  was approximately million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share at any time prior to maturity 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in august  we entered into one year revolving credit facilities agreement with an aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
the agreement is unsecured and contains customary restrictive covenants  including covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we are not subject to a borrowing base limitation and borrowings thereunder bear interest at libor plus to depending on certain cash ratios 
the maximum borrowings available under the facility were reduced by the value of outstanding letters of credit issued by the lender on our behalf  million of which were outstanding at december  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants 
we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies in addition to the pending aspect and supplybase transactions  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investment balances  available borrowings under revolving credit agreements and potential cash flows from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies or joint venture arrangements could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
year issues prior to january   there was a great deal of concern regarding the ability of computers to adequately distinguish st century dates from th century dates due to the two digit date fields used by many computer systems and software programs 
this inability to distinguish whether means or  may have resulted in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
most reports to date  however  are that computer systems are functioning normally and the compliance and remediation work accomplished leading up to was effective and prevented such problems 
we believe that current versions of our software products  including software licensed from third parties  are year compliant 
however  some customers may be running earlier versions of the software products developed by companies that we have acquired that may not be year compliant  and we have encouraged those customers to migrate to current product versions 
moreover  our products are often integrated into enterprise systems involving complicated software products developed by other vendors 
year problems inherent in a customer s transactional software programs might significantly limit that customer s ability to realize the intended benefits of our products 
we are not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing and maintaining our computer and technology systems for the year however  we may experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects  which could seriously harm our business 
these include  without limitation  delay or loss of revenues  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  or liability from our customers 
in addition  some experts have predicted significant litigation against software vendors regarding year compliance issues 
due to the unprecedented nature of any existing or future litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent we may be impacted 
we have not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date involving products or services related to year issues 
however  in the future  we may need to defend our products or services in those proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability for year related damages  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of our customers 
our current or future customers may incur significant expenses to achieve year compliance 
if our customers are not year compliant  they may experience material costs to remedy problems  or they may face litigation costs 
in either case  year issues could reduce or eliminate the budgets that current or potential customers could have for or delay purchases of our products and services 
as a result  our business could be seriously harmed 
we are also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation company year compliance failure interruptions 
to date  we have incurred approximately  of expenses in compliance and remediation work which was funded from operating cash flows 
we may incur additional costs related to the year plan for administrative personnel to finish managing the project  outside contractor assistance  technical support for our products  product engineering and customer satisfaction 
computer experts have warned that there may still be residual consequences of the change in centuries 
any such difficulties could result in a decrease in sales of our products  an increase in the allocation of resources to address our customers problems with the year without additional revenue commensurate with such resource dedication  or an increase in litigation costs relating to losses suffered by our customers due to year problems 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  issued sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas no

revenues generated from the european region in  and were  and of total revenues  respectively 
international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in us dollars 
any gains or losses from hedging activities have not been material to date 
our subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income on our investments is presented in other income  net 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
while certain of our investment securities had maturities in excess of one year  we intend to liquidate such securities within one year 
the weighted average interest rate on investment securities at december  was 
the book value of securities held at december  approximates fair value
