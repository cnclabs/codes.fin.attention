during  we reduced our earning asset balances in order to free capital to fund the start up operations at holdings and fund our stock repurchases 
in the third quarter of  we began reporting many of our assets at market value for income statement purposes 
this served to decrease our outstanding premium balance  thereby reducing the effect that prepayments had on our earning asset yields 
as a result  our earning asset yield increased slightly in from  despite a lower average coupon rate 
the increase in yield is due to reduced premium amortization expenses caused by a combination of lower net premium balances and slower prepayment speeds during the later half of in the fourth quarter of  interest income was million

prior to  we also expensed credit provisions on a portfolio of subordinated mortgage securities 
we stopped taking credit provisions on this pool of securities in december when we restructured our credit risk on these securities through a resecuritization transaction smfc re remic securities 
we believe the existing reserve for the smfc re remic securities of million at december  will be sufficient to cover likely future credit losses 
actual realized taxable credit losses for the whole company were million in  million in  and million in in the quarter ended december   credit provisions were million and there were no actual credit losses 
for the fourth quarter of  credit provisions were million and there were no actual credit losses 
we have recently purchased  and intend to continue to purchase  mortgage backed securities that have risk of credit loss 
in acquiring such assets  we project cash flows and resulting yields under a variety of potential loss scenarios as well as other factors eg  interest rates  prepayment speeds 
these securities are purchased at a discount  in part because of the credit risk inherent in these assets 
we anticipate a yield on such assets after factoring in anticipated losses 
thus  we do not plan to build a credit reserve for such assets  as such losses are already imbedded in the price paid and resulting yields on such assets 
the amount of discount amortized into income is based on the projected future cash flows  after credit losses  on such asset 
once acquired  we continue to review the projected losses on each asset 
should projected credit losses change which can occur for a variety of reasons  the effective yield earned over the remaining life of the asset will change accordingly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor to provide our shareholders an opportunity to realize an attractive total rate of return through redwood trust stock ownership 
we do not seek to avoid all risks 
we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do undertake 
our strategy for managing some of these risks includes the use of derivative interest rate agreements 
please see note summary of significant accounting policies for additional discussions on our use of interest rate agreements and their designation as trading instruments 
qualitative information about market risk market value risk the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates  liquidity  financing  supply and demand  credit  and other factors 
these fluctuations affect our earnings 
at december   we owned mortgage securities and loans totaling billion that we account for on a mark to market basis or  in the case of mortgage loans  on a lower of cost or market basis  for purposes of determining reported earnings 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons and had fixed rate coupons 
our interest rate agreements hedging program may offset some asset market value fluctuations due to interest rate changes 
all of our billion in notional amounts of interest rate agreements are marked to market for income statement purposes 
market value fluctuations of assets and interest rate agreements  especially to the extent assets are funded with short term borrowings  can also affect our access to liquidity 
interest rate risk at december   we  including sequoia  owned billion of assets and had billion of liabilities 
the majority of the assets were adjustable rate  as were a majority of the liabilities 
fixed rate mortgage assets and hybrid mortgage assets with fixed rate coupons for to years and adjustable rate coupons thereafter totaled billion  or of total assets 
we had debt with interest rate reset characteristics matched to the hybrid mortgages totaling billion 
on average  our cost of funds has the ability to rise or fall more quickly as a result of changes in short term interest rates than does the earning rate on our assets 
in the case of a large increase in short term interest rates  periodic and lifetime caps for a portion of our assets could limit increases in interest income 
the risk of reduced earnings in a rising interest rate environment is mitigated to some extent by our interest rate agreement hedging program and by any concurrent slowing of mortgage prepayment rates that may occur 
our net income may vary somewhat as the yield curve between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates vary 
at december   we effectively owned billion of adjustable rate mortgage assets with interest rates that adjust every six or twelve months as a function of interest rates of the same maturity funded with billion of debt that had an interest rate that adjusts monthly as a function of one month libor interest rates 
at december   we owned billion of adjustable rate mortgage assets that adjust monthly as a function of one month interest rates  funded with million of debt that also adjusts monthly as a function of one month libor interest rates 
adjustable rate assets with earnings rates dependent on us treasury rates totaled billion at december  liabilities with a cost of funds dependent on us treasury rates totaled billion at that time 
as part of our hedging program  we also had billion notional amount of basis swaps that  in effect  increased our us treasury based liabilities to billion 
thus  at december   our us treasury based assets equaled our us treasury based liabilities 
these basis swaps all matured in early to the extent our treasury based assets are not funded with treasury based liabilities or effectively funded with treasury based liabilities through the use of interest rate agreements  we incur basis risk 
such risk arises because changes in treasury rates may differ significantly from changes in the fed funds  libor  or euro dollar interest rates 
interest rates and related factors can affect our spread income and our mark to market results 
changes in interest rates also affect prepayment rates see below and influence other factors that may affect our results 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt 
even if the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are well matched  maturities may not be matched 
in addition  trends in the liquidity of the us capital markets in general may affect our ability to rollover short term debt 
the assets that we pledge to secure short term borrowings are generally high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  we have not had difficulty refinancing our short term debt as it matures  even during the financial market liquidity crisis in late still  changes in the market values of our assets  in our perceived credit worthiness  in lender over collateralization requirements  and in the capital markets  can impact our access to liquidity 
at december   we had million of highly liquid assets which were unpledged and available to meet margin calls on short term debt that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender over collateralization requirements 
these assets consisted of unrestricted cash and unpledged aaa rated mortgage securities 
total available liquidity  including unrestricted cash  equaled of our short term debt balances 
we paid commitment fees in to secure two committed lines of short term financing 
there are certain restrictions regarding the collateral for which these lines can be used  but they generally allow us to fund whole loan acquisitions for the term of the commitments 
there is no assurance that we will be able to renew or wish to renew such lines upon expiration 
prepayment risk as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize into income our mortgage premium balances as an expense and our mortgage discount balances as income 
mortgage premium balances arise when we acquire mortgage assets at a price in excess of the principal value of the mortgages 
premium balances are also created when an asset appreciates and is marked to market at a price above par 
mortgage discount balances arise when we acquire mortgage assets at a price below the principal value of the mortgages  or when an asset depreciates in market value and is marked to market at a price below par 
at december   mortgage premium balances were million and mortgage discount balances were million 
net mortgage premium was million 
since the prepayment characteristics of our premium and discount mortgage assets may vary  gross premium levels  net premium levels  and other factors may influence our earnings 
sequoia s long term debt has associated deferred bond issuance costs 
these capitalized costs are amortized as an expense as the bonds are paid off with mortgage principal receipts 
these deferred costs totaled million at december  in addition  premium received from the issuance of bonds at prices over principal value is amortized as income as the bond issues pay down 
these balances totaled million at december  the combined effect of these two items was to reduce our effective mortgage related premium by million 
our net premium at december  for assets and liabilities affected by the rate of mortgage principal receipts was million 
this net premium equaled of common equity 
amortization expense and income will vary as prepayment rates on mortgage assets vary 
in addition  changes in prepayment rates will effect the market value of our assets and our earnings 
changes in the value of our assets  to the extent they are incorporated into the basis of our assets  will also affect future amortization expense 
credit risk our principal credit risk comes from mortgage loans owned by sequoia  mortgage loans held in portfolio  and our lower rated mortgage securities 
we also have credit risk with counter parties with whom we do business 
not including mortgage loans owned by sequoia  we owned million in residential mortgage loans at december  of these  million were seriously delinquent delinquent over days  in foreclosure  in bankruptcy  or real estate owned 
we also owned million in commercial mortgage loans 
these commercial mortgage loans were all current at december  the three sequoia trusts owned billion in residential mortgage loans at december  our total credit risk from these trusts is limited to our equity investment in these trusts 
these equity investments had a reported value of million  net of related credit reserves  at december  at that time  million of the underlying loans  or  were seriously delinquent 
at december   we had million of credit reserves to provide for potential future credit losses from our mortgage loans 
the reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our mortgage loans  including current and projected economic conditions  delinquency status  and credit protection 
total seriously delinquent loans had a loan balance of million 
to date  our realized credit losses from defaulted residential mortgage loans have averaged of the loan balance of the defaulted loans 
loss severity may increase in the future  however  particularly if real estate values decline 
we believe our current level of reserve and credit provision policy is reasonable 
at december   we also had million credit reserves for our smfc re remic securities 
our total potential credit exposure from these securities after this credit reserve is our net cost basis of million 
at this time  we believe the credit reserve is sufficient to cover currently foreseen credit losses from these assets 
capital risk our capital levels  and thus our access to borrowings and liquidity  may be tested  particularly if the market value of our assets securing short term borrowings declines 
through our risk adjusted capital policy  we assign a guideline capital adequacy amount  expressed as a guideline equity to assets ratio  to each of our mortgage assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio will fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by our collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for equity interests in sequoia trusts and for lower rated mortgage securities generally equal our net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of our mortgage assets is our aggregate guideline capital adequacy amount 
the total guideline equity to assets ratio capital amount has declined over the last few years as we have eliminated some of the risks of short term debt funding through issuing long term debt 
in the most recent quarters  however  the total guideline ratio has increased as we have acquired new types of assets such as commercial mortgage loans and lower rated mortgage securities 
we do not expect that our actual capital levels will always exceed the guideline amount 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  our capital guideline amount may rise  as the potential interest rate risk of our mortgages would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps and slowing prepayment rates 
we measure all of our mortgage assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
our actual capital levels  as determined for the risk adjusted capital policy  would likely fall as rates increase as the market values of our mortgages  net of mark to market gains on hedges  decreased 
such market value declines may be temporary as well  as future coupon adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage loans may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which our actual capital levels decreased below our capital adequacy guideline amount  we would generally cease the acquisition of new mortgage assets until capital balance was restored through prepayments  interest rate changes  or other means 
in certain cases prior to a planned equity offering or other circumstances  the board of directors has authorized management to acquire mortgage assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of our risk adjusted capital policy 
growth in assets and earnings may be limited when our access to new equity capital is limited 
holdings can benefit over time from the re investment of retained earnings at holdings 
our mortgage finance operation  however  is generally required to distribute at least of taxable income as dividends 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our dividends must equal at least of our net income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
quantitative information about market risk the information presented in the table below includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets  fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities and also utilize interest rate sensitive derivative financial instruments 
we designate some of these assets as trading and others as non trading 
the designation of an asset as trading does not necessarily imply that we have a short term intended holding period for that asset 
the table below includes information about the possible future repayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities and constitutes a forward looking statement 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed 
other events will occur and will affect the outcomes 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls  and restructurings could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of markets as of december  was used to project the average interest rates for each year  based on the existing characteristics of the portfolio 
the maturity of cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance  actual prepayment speeds will vary 
as of december   all short term interest rate sensitive liabilities were scheduled to mature in the balance of long term interest rate sensitive liabilities is amortized with the receipt of principal payments from the mortgages securing such debt 
thus  long term liability maturities are presented based on the principal maturities of the underlying mortgages at assumed prepayment rates 
weighted average interest rates for the year are based on the forward curve and the characteristics of such debt 
information presented on derivative financial instruments includes the notional amounts of such instruments by maturity date and the effective strike  pay or receive rates by the year in which instruments mature 
the information includes all of our derivative instruments owned as of december   regardless of whether they were effective at december  or were scheduled to become effective at a later date
