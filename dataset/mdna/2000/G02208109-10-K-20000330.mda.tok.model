in addition  cost effective reinsurance capacity significantly diminished throughout this has resulted in realm national retaining a greater proportion of its business on some programs but has also led to the cancellation of certain other programs 
while these competitive insurance and reinsurance market conditions continue  they are likely to restrict realm national s ability to expand its existing book of business 
segment loss of million in represented a decrease of million from segment profit of million in  which increased million from segment profit of million in the results for the year were adversely affected by a provision of million against reinsurance recoveries and a million accounting charge following the adoption of sop reinsurance the company s reinsurance segment consists of its reinsurance subsidiary  circl

the increase of million in insurance and reinsurance balances receivable  and the corresponding increase of million in insurance and reinsurance balances payable  primarily reflects the growth in clients claims balances recorded in the company s broking subsidiaries 
as a result of various disputes between insurers and reinsurers on various reinsurance contracts  a number of the reinsurers have suspended paying claims due under the contracts 
the company s brokerage and underwriting management segment subsidiaries experienced a significant growth in client balances receivable and payable recorded at the end of the year  reflecting this accumulation of claims due by one party to another

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs or non information systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or in miscalculations 
in  the company appointed individuals in each of the company s geographic regions to review and assess the company s state of readiness and its ability to process transactions in the year these individuals and the overall committee that they are a part of are provided guidance to the operating and support departments  and monitored the progress of efforts made to address the year issue 
during the company implemented its plan and prepared its various computer systems and selected applications for the year this process involved taking inventory  testing  evaluating and adjusting all known date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
in addition  the company reviewed its essential non information technology systems for year compliance 
the company also consulted with various third parties  including  but not limited to  outside consultants  outside service providers and infrastructure providers to develop approaches to the year issue  to gain insight into problems and to provide additional perspective on solutions 
compliance work with respect to the company s internal systems was completed during in the last quarter of  all systems critical to the company s core businesses were retested and rollover testing was performed 
the company is not aware of any significant internal or external problems occurring to date with respect to the year issue 
in the us and bermuda  the company s and its subsidiaries internal computer systems and software are relatively modern and few costs were incurred to bring those systems into compliance 
in the uk  the company s subsidiaries internal systems and software were not as modern and the majority of the company s year costs in upgrading the company s systems and software were incurred in that region 
because of the year issue  one large system in the uk was replaced in late no further costs are expected with regard to the year issue 
the company continues to assess its external relationships with third parties 
during the company communicated with its significant vendors and large customers to determine the extent to which the company was vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year problems 
although there were no problems noted following december   there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties  such as utility companies  regulatory bodies  government entities  insurance related companies or insurance carriers on which the company s operations rely  will continue to be immune to post year end year problems that would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with and assessment of third parties will minimize these risks 
the company s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may also have an underwriting exposure to the year issue 
although the subsidiaries have not received any claims of coverage from insureds based on losses resulting from year issues  there can be no assurance that insureds will be free from losses of this type or that these subsidiaries will be free from claims made under their policies 
the total cost of compliance was million 
approximately million of the cost was related to reprogramming or replacement of software  and approximately million was related to acquisition of hardware 
costs related to non information technology were immaterial 
all of the million cost of compliance was incurred as of the end of december  all of these costs were funded through operating cash flows 
total costs have not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
based on the review of the company and its risks  the company currently anticipates minimal business disruption will occur as a result of post year end year issues 
nonetheless  the year issue represents a risk that cannot be assessed with precision nor controlled with certainty 
possible consequences of disruptions that could occur include  but are not limited to  loss of communication links with subsidiaries and insurance carriers  loss of electric power  inability to process transactions or inability to engage in similar normal business activities 
furthermore  failure of significant third parties with which the company conducts business  including insurance carriers and reinsurers  to meet year compliance could have a materially detrimental effect on the company 
the company established a contingency plan for possible year issues 
where needed  the company will revise or adjust its contingency plan based on actual testing experience with its systems and assessment of outside risks

inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
the potential adverse impacts of inflation include a a decline in the market value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio  b an increase in the ultimate cost of settling claims which remain unresolved for a significant period of time  and c an increase in the company s operating expenses 
however  the company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity and currently believes that an acceptable amount is included in the yield to compensate the company for the risk of inflation 
any increase in the cost of settling claims will be offset by increases in investment income earned and  generally  an increase in operating expenses resulting from inflation should be matched by similar increases in investment income earned on the company s general surplus funds 
item a market risk the company s investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  equity securities  and short term investments 
the company s exposure to market risk is primarily limited to changing interest rates  primarily in the united states  as all fixed maturity investments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair value of the fixed maturity investments as at december  was million 
a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of the company s investments and will lead to fluctuations in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage market risk in its portfolio 
the table below expressed in millions of us dollars presents the par value amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s us dollar denominated investment portfolio 
total investments fixed maturity weighted average interest rate given the limited value of balances and transactions in foreign currencies  the company s exposure to foreign currency movements is considered to be insignificant
