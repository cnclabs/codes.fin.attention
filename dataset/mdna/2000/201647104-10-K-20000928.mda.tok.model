additionally  the corporation will continue to build and leverage an infrastructure designed to increase noninterest income 
the corporation s operations are also continually reviewed in order to gain efficiencies to increase productivity and reduce costs 
during fiscal year  the corporation consummated the acquisitions of three financial institutions amerus bank amerus  first colorado bancorp  inc first colorado and midland first financial corporation midland 
on a combined basis  these institutions operated branches and had assets of billion and deposits of billion 
these acquisitions provided the corporation entry into three new states  access to supermarket branches and significant expansion of its presence in the metropolitan areas of denver  colorado and kansas city  missouri 
the accounts and results of operations of amerus and midland are reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements beginning july   and march   respectively  since these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
the first colorado acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests accounting method so the corporation s historical consolidated financial statements were restated for all prior periods to include first colorado s accounts and results of operations 
in november  the corporation announced an initiative to integrate the corporation s most recent seven acquisitions and new data processing system to support community banking operations 
this plan was aimed at decreasing expenses  increasing sustainable growth in revenues  and increasing productivity through the elimination of duplicate or inefficient functions 
implementation of this plan resulted in exit costs and termination benefits totaling million million after tax or 
per diluted share recorded in fiscal year see exit costs and termination benefits for additional information 
on august   the board of directors approved a series of key strategic initiatives aimed at improving the overall operations of the corporation  strengthening earnings and enhancing shareholder value 
these key initiatives include a complete balance sheet review  a thorough assessment of the bank s delivery and servicing systems  the sale of the underperforming leasing company  an acceleration of the disposition of other real estate owned and a management restructuring 
the formal plan to achieve these strategic initiatives is in process 
management is currently identifying all significant actions to be taken and finalizing the expected timetable for completion 
the total estimated exit costs and termination benefits have not been determined 
see subsequent event key strategic initiatives for additional information 
net income for fiscal year was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal year  and million  or per diluted share for fiscal year fiscal year net income includes the effect of after tax charges of million relating to exit costs and termination benefits  an after tax gain of million from the sale of the corporate headquarters building and a charge totaling million after tax  representing the effect of the change in accounting for certain start up costs 
fiscal year net income was reduced by an after tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share million pre tax associated primarily with the first colorado acquisition and the termination of employee stock ownership plans acquired in the mergers of three financial institutions the past two fiscal years 
fiscal year net income was reduced by an after tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share  million pre tax  associated with merger related expenses and other nonrecurring charges 
exit costs and termination benefits in november  the corporation announced an initiative to integrate the corporation s most recent seven acquisitions and new data processing system to support community banking operations 
this plan was aimed at decreasing expenses  increasing sustainable growth in revenues  and increasing productivity through the elimination of duplicate or inefficient functions 
this plan was approved by the corporation s board of directors effective december  major aspects of the plan included branches to be sold or closed  the elimination of positions and the consolidation of the correspondent loan servicing operations 
implementation of this plan resulted in charges for exit costs and termination benefits totaling million million after tax or 
per diluted share recorded in fiscal year at june   the liability balance associated with these costs totaled  direct and incremental costs associated with the sale and closing of the branches totaled million 
as of june   six branches were sold or closed 
it is expected that the remaining branches will be sold or closed by november the initiative eliminated positions with personnel costs consisting of severance  benefits and related professional services totaling million 
this plan also included the consolidation of the correspondent loan servicing functions to omaha  nebraska from wichita  kansas and denver  colorado 
as of june   this portion of the plan was completed 
common stock repurchases effective april   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to five percent  or approximately  shares of the corporation s outstanding common stock 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the corporation repurchased and cancelled  shares of its common stock at a cost of million

on august   the board of directors authorized a third repurchase of up to of the corporation s outstanding stock  or approximately  shares 
this repurchase is to be completed no later than february repurchases can be made at any time and in an amount  depending upon market conditions and various other factors 
any repurchase generally will be on the open market  although privately negotiated transactions are also possible 
in compliance with nebraska law  all repurchased shares will be cancelled 
subsequent event key strategic initiatives on august  the board of directors approved and management announced a series of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the overall operations of the corporation 
key initiatives include 
a complete balance sheet review including the disposition of over billion in low yielding and higher risk investments and residential mortgage loans resulting in a pre tax charge to earnings in the range of approximately million to million 
the proceeds from this disposition are expected to be used to reduce high cost borrowings by up to billion  to repurchase additional shares of the corporation s common stock with the remainder reinvested in lower risk securities with a predictable income stream 

a thorough assessment of the bank s delivery and servicing systems to ensure the proper channels to achieve the growth potential and to maintain a high level of customer service 

the sale of the leasing company acquired as part of the february acquisition of liberty is anticipated to result in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million 

acceleration of the disposition of other real estate owned anticipated to result in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million 

a management restructuring to further streamline the organization and improve efficiencies as well as the appointment of a new chief operating officer 

a program to further strengthen the commercial lending portfolio by actively recruiting new lenders in order to accelerate the growth in loans experienced over the past year  while maintaining credit quality 

a change in the corporation s fiscal year end from june to december 
an expansion of the corporation s common stock repurchase program by up to of its outstanding shares  or approximately million shares 
management anticipates to sell the approximate billion in investments and mortgage loans  as well as the leasing portfolio  by december  the estimated pretax charges disclosed above reflect management s expectations given the current information available 
the formal plan to achieve these strategic initiatives is in process 
management is currently identifying all significant actions to be taken and finalizing the expected timetable for completion 
the total estimated exit costs and termination benefits have not been determined 
subsequent event change in fiscal year end on august   the board of directors approved a change in the corporation s fiscal year end from june to december this change is effective for calendar year a december year end allows the corporation to be aligned with the financial industry from a reporting perspective and will facilitate comparisons with industry norms 
the by laws were amended to reflect this change in fiscal year 
as a result  the corporation s next annual meeting of shareholders is scheduled for may  asset liability management the operations of the corporation are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference  or mismatch  between the amount of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice in specified periods 
when interest rates change  to the extent the corporation s interest earning assets have longer maturities or effective repricing periods than its interest bearing liabilities  the interest income realized on the corporation s interest earning assets will adjust more slowly than the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch in the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities is commonly referred to as the gap 
a gap is considered positive when the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
similarly  during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
the corporation has historically invested in interest earning assets that reprice more slowly than its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch exposes the corporation to interest rate risk 
in a rising rate environment liabilities will reprice faster than interest earning assets  thereby decreasing net interest income 
the corporation seeks to control its exposure to interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term assets such as commercial and consumer loans 
in addition  the corporation utilizes longer term advances from the federal home loan bank to extend the repricing characteristics of its interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation also enters into interest rate swap agreements with other counterparties in order to lengthen synthetically its short term debt obligations 
in connection with its asset liability management program  the corporation has interest rate swap agreements with other counterparties under terms that provide for an exchange of interest payments on the outstanding notional amount of the swap agreement 
these agreements are primarily used to artificially lengthen the maturity of certain deposit liabilities 
in accordance with these arrangements the corporation pays fixed rates and receives variable rates of interest according to a specified index 
the corporation had swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion at june   and million at june  and for fiscal years  and  the corporation recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net interest expense from its interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements have maturities ranging from july to june see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the corporation s swap agreements 
the following table represents management s projected maturity and repricing of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at june  the amounts of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and interest rate swap agreements presented which mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms and expected behavior of such assets  liabilities and interest rate swap agreements 
adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
all loans and mortgage backed securities are adjusted for prepayment rates based on information from independent sources as of june  and the bank s historical prepayment experience 
fixed rate passbook deposits  now accounts and non indexed money market accounts are assumed to reprice or mature according to the decay rates as defined by regulatory guidelines 
indexed money market rate deposits are deemed to reprice or mature within the day category 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers such assumptions reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could vary substantially if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
within days over years days to year to years and over total dollars in thousands interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage loans      other loans      investments      interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings deposits      other time deposits      borrowings      impact of interest rate swap agreements    interest bearing liabilities      gap position      cumulative gap position      gap as a percentage of the bank s total assets 
cumulative gap as a percentage of the bank s total assets includes conventional single family and multi family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
includes adjustable rate single family mortgage loans  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and all other types of loans with either fixed or adjustable interest rates 
included in the within days column is federal home loan bank stock of million 
includes advances from the federal home loan bank  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings 
the bank s one year cumulative gap is a negative billion  or of the bank s total assets at june   contrasted to a negative billion  or of the bank s total assets at june  the interest rate risk policy of the bank generally authorizes a liability sensitive one year cumulative gap not to exceed  however  a temporary limit increase to was approved by the board of directors for the june  quarter 
this increase to was made to allow more flexible management of interest rate risk due to the anticipated restructure of the balance sheet 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through analysis of the change in the net portfolio value npv 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate sensitivity and repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components  consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in the npv ratio and net interest income 
a primary goal of the corporation s combined portfolio is that its capital is leveraged effectively into assets and liabilities which maximize corporate profitability while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco and the board of directors review the interest rate risk position of the bank on at least a quarterly basis 
several measures are employed to determine the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
market value sensitivity analysis measures the change in the bank s npv ratio in the event of sudden and sustained changes in market interest rates 
the npv ratio is defined as the market value of the bank s capital divided by the market value of its assets 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to compare the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
finally  net interest income sensitivity analysis is used to measure the impact of changing interest rates on corporate earnings 
if estimated changes to the npv ratio and the sensitivity gap are not within the limits established by the board of directors  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
the corporation s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes a minimum allowable npv ratio generally over a range of hypothetical interest rates extending from basis points below current levels to basis points above current levels 
in addition  the policy establishes a maximum allowable change in the npv ratio of in the event of an instantaneous and adverse change in interest rates of basis points 
the ots monitors the bank s interest rate risk management procedures under guidelines set forth in thrift bulletin a tb a 
this bulletin requires that the corporation s board of directors set interest rate risk limits that would prohibit the bank from exhibiting a post shock npv ratio and interest rate sensitivity measure of significant risk or greater 
the ots limits set a minimum npv ratio of at the basis points rate shock level  and a maximum change in npv ratio of at the same level 
the limits the board has imposed on the bank are more conservative than the limits set by the ots to maintain a risk rating better than significant risk 
the following table presents the projected change in the bank s npv ratio for various hypothetical rate shock levels as of june  hypothetical market market change change in value of value of npv board in npv board interest rates capital assets ratio limit ratio limit dollars in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise   basis point rise   
base scenario   basis point decline   
basis point decline   basis point decline   
the preceding table indicates that at june   the bank s npv ratio would decrease in the event of an immediate rise in interest rates  while the bank s npv ratio would increase in the event of immediate decline in interest rates 
at june   the bank s npv ratios were within the targets set by the board of directors in all rate scenarios except the and basis point rise scenarios 
management had previously discussed with the board that these npv ratios may fall outside the board limits  but remain within regulatory limits due to the anticipated balance sheet restructure 
at june  the bank was within the limits set by the ots to maintain a risk rating of better than significant risk 
in september  the board approved the reduction of the post shock npv limits to a minimum of from except the basis point rise shock which was reduced to from 
these reductions were also made to allow more flexible management of interest rate risk due to the anticipated restructure of the balance sheet 
the npv ratio is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines established by the ots 
the modeling calculation is based on the net present value of discounted estimated cash flows utilizing prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent brokers and other public sources as of june   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in interest rates as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
results of operations net income for fiscal year was million  or per diluted and basic share 
these results compare to net income for fiscal year of million  or per diluted share per basic share and to net income for fiscal year of million  or per diluted share per basic share 
see ratios for certain performance ratios of the corporation for fiscal years  and the increase in net income for fiscal year compared to is primarily due to net increases of million and million  respectively  in total other income and net interest income after provision for losses and a net decrease of million in the provision for income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by net increases of million in total general and administrative expenses  million in amortization of intangible assets and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle totaling million 
the increase in net income for fiscal year compared to is primarily due to net increases of million in net interest income after provision for losses and million in total other operating income 
these increases to net income were partially offset by net increases of million in total general and administrative expenses including an increase of million in merger expenses  million in amortization of intangible assets and million in the provision for income taxes 
operating earnings  which excludes the effect of exit costs and termination benefits  merger related expenses and other nonrecurring income and charges  totaled million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year and million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year fiscal year cash operating earnings totaled million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share for fiscal year and million per diluted share for fiscal year cash operating earnings are operating earnings less the effect of the amortization of intangible assets  net of applicable income taxes 
management believes that cash operating earnings are a significant measure of a company s performance  and reflect the corporation s ability to generate capital that could be leveraged for future growth 
net interest income and interest rate spread net interest income totaled million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  and compared to million for fiscal year based on the portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the end of the last three fiscal years  interest rate spreads were  and at june   and this represents a decrease of basis points comparing the interest rate spread at june   to the interest rate spread at june   and an increase of six basis points comparing the spreads at june   to in addition  during fiscal years  and  interest rate spreads were  and 
this represents a decrease of basis points comparing the interest rate spread during fiscal year to and an increase of basis points comparing the spread during fiscal year to the net yield on interest earning assets during fiscal years  and was  and  representing a decrease of basis points comparing fiscal year to and an increase of basis points comparing fiscal year to net interest income for fiscal year increased over due primarily to average interest earning assets increasing billion to billion for fiscal year compared to billion for this increase was partially offset by a net increase in average interest bearing liabilities of billion to billion for fiscal year the increases in these average balances are due in part to growth in the loan portfolio  primarily residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans  and the midland acquisition on march  the loan growth was partially funded with fhlb advances 
these net increases in total earning assets and costing liabilities are partially offset by the compression of the interest rate spreads 
the interest rate spread decreased basis points due primarily to a basis point increase in costing liabilities as a result of the rise in short term interest rates and the liability sensitive balance sheet of the corporation 
over the past year  the federal reserve increased interest rates basis points 
the corporation s interest income will come under further pressure if interest rates continue to rise 
a continued rise in interest rates may erode the bank s assets at the same time that costs of funds are increasing 
the future trend in interest rate spreads and net interest income will be dependent upon such factors as the composition and size of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate risk exposure of the corporation and the maturity and repricing activity of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  as influenced by changes in and levels of both short term and long term market interest rates 
net interest income for fiscal year increased over primarily due to average interest earning assets increasing billion to billion for fiscal year compared to billion for and the basis point reduction in interest rates on interest bearing liabilities over the respective fiscal years 
these increases were partially offset by a net increase of billion in average interest bearing liabilities to billion for fiscal year compared to billion for and the basis point decrease in interest rates on interest earning assets over the respective fiscal years 
the increases in the average balances are due to the acquisitions of amerus on july   and midland on march  contributing to the basis point increase in the fiscal year interest rate spread over is the reduction in the cost of long term callable advances from the fhlb 
in the fiscal year flat yield curve environment  the corporation increased its borrowing of long term fixed rate fhlb advances that are convertible at the option of the fhlb into adjustable rate advances 
these advances were borrowed in lieu of other short term funding alternatives and decreased the rate on fhlb advances by basis points for fiscal year over the following table presents certain information concerning yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during and at the end of each of the fiscal years presented for the year ended june  at june  weighted average yield on loans and leases mortgage backed securities investments interest earning assets weighted average rate paid on savings deposits other time deposits advances from fhlb securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowings interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread net yield on interest earning assets the table below presents average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  interest income and interest expense  and average yields and rates during the periods indicated

interest earning average assets for fiscal year were fully impacted by the million cash outlay to finance the midland acquisition on march   and by the million to repurchase common stock 
the decrease in the net earnings balance for fiscal year compared to is primarily due to the acquisitions of amerus and midland and the repurchase of  shares of common stock 
the amerus acquisition was financed by million of one year notes  in part by the million unsecured term note due july   and by the outlay of existing cash 
the repurchase of common stock totaled million

for fiscal years and loss reserves totaling million and million  respectively  were recorded to conform the reserve positions of pooled acquisitions to the policies of the corporation 
excluding these reserves  the loan loss provisions totaled million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to additional reserves recorded to cover consumer loan losses 
at june   the corporation s residential loan portfolio totaling billion is secured by properties primarily located in colorado  nebraska and kansas

the commercial real estate loan portfolio at june   totaling billion is secured by properties primarily located in colorado  iowa and kansas 
at june   commercial real estate loans totaled million and were secured by properties primarily located in colorado  kansas and iowa 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the collectibility of outstanding loans and leases  which takes into consideration such factors as changes in the composition of the loan and lease portfolios and economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  regular examinations by the corporation s credit review group of specific problem loans and leases and of the overall portfolio quality and real estate market conditions in the corporation s lending areas 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at june   or of total nonperforming loans and leases  compared to million  or  at june   and million  or  at june  the corporation recorded net losses from real estate operations in fiscal years and totaling  and million  respectively  and net income of million in fiscal year real estate operations reflect provisions for real estate losses  net real estate operating activity  and gains and losses on dispositions of real estate

the net decrease in real estate operations for fiscal year compared to is due primarily to a decrease in net gains on dispositions of real estate totaling million  a net increase in operating expenses of approximately  and a net increase in provisions for real estate losses 
management of the corporation believes that present levels of allowances for loan losses are adequate to reflect the risks inherent in its portfolios 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience increases in its nonperforming assets  that it will not increase the level of its allowances in the future or that significant provisions for losses will not be required based on factors such as deterioration in market conditions  changes in borrowers financial conditions  delinquencies and defaults 
nonperforming assets are monitored on a regular basis by the corporation s internal credit review and problem asset groups

at june   real estate was located primarily in missouri and iowa and totaled million and million  respectively  before allowance for losses 
troubled debt restructurings decreased million at june   compared to june   due to the reclassification of million of troubled commercial restructurings to nonperforming loan status and million of commercial troubled debt restructurings to current loan status 
troubled debt restructurings increased million at june   compared to june   due to the addition of loans classified as commercial troubled debt restructurings totaling approximately million offset primarily by the reclassifications of million to nonperforming loan status and million to current loan status and payoffs totaling approximately million 
the ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases decreased to 
at june   based on loan and lease balances of billion 
this ratio compares to 
and  respectively  at june  and  which were based on loan and lease balances of billion and billion 
the ratio decreased at june   compared to due to the net decrease in nonperforming loans and leases and the increase in the total balance of loans and leases 
this ratio at june   increased compared to due to a net increase in nonperforming loans and leases  primarily delinquent residential and commercial loans  partially offset by increases in the total balance of loans and leases 
nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to

at june  due to the decrease in nonperforming assets combined with the increase in total assets 
increasing nonperforming assets accounts for the 
ratio for nonperforming assets to total assets at june   compared to 
at june   even though total assets also increased 
the decrease in total allowance for loan and lease losses to million at june   compared to million at june   is primarily due to an increase in net charge offs in fiscal compared to the total allowance for loan and lease losses increased to million at june   compared to million at june   due primarily to increases in allowances acquired in purchase acquisitions 
the percentage of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases at june   of

non interest income loan servicing fees loan servicing fees totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the amount of revenue generated from loan servicing fees  and changes in comparing fiscal years  is primarily due to the average size of the corporation s portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for other institutions and the level of rates for service fees collected partially offset by the amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights 
the loan servicing fees category also includes fees collected for late loan payments 
the net increase in loan servicing fees comparing fiscal year to is primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights
