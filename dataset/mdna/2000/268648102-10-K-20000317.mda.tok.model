item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all historical financial information and analysis have been restated to reflect the acquisition of data general in october  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with factors that may affect future results included herein 
all dollar amounts in this md a are in millions except per share amounts 
the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenues enterprise storage hardware enterprise storage software enterprise switching products mcdata clariion storage products total storage products revenue aviion server products services total revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales cost of service research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring  merger and other charges operating income investment income  interest expense and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues total revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and or from to enterprise storage hardware revenues from products sold directly and through oems and resellers were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increase in enterprise systems revenues was primarily due to the continued strong demand for the company s symmetrix series of products 
these products address the growing demand for enterprise wide storage solutions  allowing users to move  store and protect mission critical information in unix  windows nt and mainframe environments 
enterprise storage software revenues from products sold directly and through oems and resellers were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increase in software revenues was primarily due to increased licenses of enterprise storage software on symmetrix systems  both newly shipped and already installed  and the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products 
revenues from enterprise switching products sold directly by mcdata  primarily the escon director series of products  were  and in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to and a decrease of  or  from to the decreases from to and from to were primarily due to the product transition from escon based to fibre channel based directors 
the company anticipates that revenues from escon directors will continue to decline 
revenues from the clariion line of storage products  excluding related service revenues  were  and in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to and a decrease of  or  from to the increase in clariion revenues reflects an increase in direct sales offset by decreased sales volume from indirect channels 
the decrease in is primarily the result of a longer than anticipated product transition from scsi based to fibre based storage products  and the resultant decrease in sales volume from indirect channels 
total storage products revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to and an increase of  or  from to the increase in both periods is due primarily to sales of enterprise storage hardware and software 
revenues from aviion server products were  and in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to and  or  from to the decrease in revenue from to was primarily the result of the closing of certain international sales offices in an effort to refocus the business and improve profitability 
service revenues were  and in  and  respectively representing an increase of  or  from to and an increase of  or  from to the increase in both periods was primarily a result of the growth in emc professional services and the acquisitions of the professional services businesses groupe mci and millennia iii  inc in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
in addition  service revenues continue to grow as a result of the larger installed base driven by increased product unit sales 
enterprise hardware and software revenues for  and under the company s reseller agreement with hewlett packard company hp were  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the company and hp agreed to terminate their reseller contract for enterprise storage products effective as of june  the company also has a reseller agreement with hp for clariion and aviion products  which represented  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues on sales into the north american markets were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the revenue growth reflects continued strong demand for the company s products and services 
revenues on sales into the markets of europe  the middle east and africa were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the reduced growth rate in reflects the impact of closing certain data general sales offices 
revenues on sales into the markets in the asia pacific region were  and in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and a decrease of  or  from to the increase in was due to the company s efforts to expand its business in this region combined with strong demand for the company s products and services 
the decrease in was principally attributable to a downturn in economic trends in the asia pacific market 
revenues on sales into the markets of latin america were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increase in both periods was primarily due to the company s efforts to expand its business in this region combined with strong demand for the company s products and services 
gross margins overall gross margins increased to in  compared to in and in product gross margins increased to in  compared to in and in the increase in product margins for both periods is primarily attributable to increased licensing of the company s enterprise software products  which have higher gross margins than sales of the company s hardware products 
software revenue as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in and in other factors affecting product gross margins include the impact of component cost declines being greater than the impact of product price declines 
the company currently believes that product price declines will continue 
service gross margins decreased to in  compared to in and in the decrease in service margins from to is primarily due to a decrease in data general service revenues caused by the closure of certain international sales offices 
the decrease in service margins from to is primarily due to a significant investment in emc professional services during research and development research and development r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in r d spending levels from to and to reflects the company s ongoing research and development efforts in a variety of areas  including emc esn technologies  network attached storage products  enhancements to the symmetrix family of products  new enterprise storage software products and fibre channel connectivity 
r d for also includes costs associated with the integration of conley corporation  acquired in august  which became the emc cambridge software development center 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were   and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in spending levels for both periods is primarily due to the company s efforts to build an infrastructure to achieve broader coverage and greater account depth around the world and to expand its technical sales organization to support the current and expected growth in software revenues 
in addition  during  the company increased its direct sales presence where it previously relied upon resellers 
restructuring  merger and other charges during fiscal year  the company recorded a total charge of related to restructuring  merger and other charges primarily related to the acquisition of data general 
during  the company recorded charges totaling related to a restructuring program and other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company approved and implemented a restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of data general 
the restructuring plan  which is expected to be completed by december  provides for the consolidation of the company s operations and elimination of duplicative facilities worldwide 
accordingly  during  the company recorded a charge of approximately related to employee termination benefits  facility closure costs  asset disposals and other exit costs which the company has recorded in operating expenses 
the expected cash impact of the charge is approximately of which was paid in the restructuring program includes an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by approximately  employees  approximately of whom are or were based in north america and of whom are or were based in europe 
the employee separations affect the majority of business functions and job classes 
of the approximately  employees identified  approximately were terminated in in  the company also recorded a charge for merger costs of for financial advisory services  legal  accounting and other direct expenses related to the data general acquisition which has been recorded in operating expenses 
in addition  the company recorded a charge related to asset impairments recorded in operating expenses and recorded a charge of for capitalized software and inventory write downs which is included in cost of product sales 
in  the company recorded a charge of related to a restructuring program and certain asset write downs resulting from the program 
the charge included approximately related to employee termination benefits  asset write downs and other exit costs which the company has recorded in operating expenses and approximately for capitalized software and inventory write downs which are included in cost of product sales 
the total cash impact of the restructuring charge is approximately  of which was paid in and was paid in as of december   the remaining accruals of from the restructuring program are primarily related to excess vacant rental properties in europe 
the restructuring program included an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by approximately employees  approximately of whom were based in north america and the remainder of whom were based in europe and the asia pacific region 
the employee separations affected the majority of business functions and job classes 
of the employees identified  approximately were terminated during and were terminated in the amounts accrued and charged against the established provisions described above were as follows beginning current year current year balance provision utilization ending balance employee termination benefits lease abandonments asset disposals other exit costs employee termination benefits lease abandonments asset disposals other exit costs investment income and interest expense investment income increased to in  from in and in investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
investment income increased in and primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances which were derived from operations 
interest expense decreased to in from in interest expense increased to in from in the decrease in from is primarily due to conversions of the convertible subordinated notes due of the company the notes to common stock 
the increase in from was primarily due to the issuance of the notes and the convertible subordinated notes due of the company the notes 
other income expense  net the net other income was in compared with the net other income of in and in the increase in the net other income from to is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of publicly traded securities acquired as part of the data general acquisition 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was in  in and in  which resulted in effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in   and were lower than the statutory federal rate due primarily to the realization of the benefits of the company s global tax strategies and the benefits derived from its offshore manufacturing operations 
the major impact of the data general acquisition to the tax provision under the pooling of interest method of acquisition accounting was a reduction in the valuation reserve formerly recorded for certain data general net operating loss carryforwards and the non deductibility of certain restructuring charges 
the company anticipates that the effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were  and  at december  and  respectively  an increase of in  cash and cash equivalents increased by and short and long term investments increased by this reflects the company s continued efforts to invest excess cash in short and long term investments  which generate a higher yield than cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities was  this was primarily generated from net income offset by an increase in working capital  primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable  consistent with the growth of the business 
cash used by investing activities was  principally for purchases of investments and additions to property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was  principally from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises 
the company has available for use a credit line of and may elect to borrow at any time 
in march  the company sold of the notes 
the notes are generally convertible into shares of common stock at any time prior to the redemption date at a conversion price of per share 
as of december   of the notes have been converted into common stock 
on february   the company announced that it would redeem all of the outstanding notes on march   however  the company believes that substantially all of the outstanding notes were converted into common stock on or prior to such date 
in may  the company sold of the notes 
the notes are generally convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
as of december   none of the notes have been converted into common stock 
based on its current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  the company believes that the combination of funds currently available  funds generated from operations and its available line of credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
factors that may affect future results the company s prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
the company s future results may differ materially from its current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in emc s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if emc s suppliers do not meet its quality or delivery requirements  emc could have decreased revenues and earnings 
emc purchases several sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers  including some of its competitors 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components and power supplies 
emc has experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet its quality and delivery requirements 
if any of its suppliers were to fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for its products  emc could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  emc periodically transitions its product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning its customers smoothly to new technologies  along with its historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet its delivery or quality requirements will have an adverse impact on emc s revenues and earnings 
emc may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry changes 
the computer storage and server markets are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
sales of the symmetrix series of products constitute the principal source of revenues for emc and emc expects these sales to continue to be the principal source of its revenues in the near future 
customer preferences in these markets are difficult to predict  however  and there can be no assurance that the symmetrix series or other of the company s products will continue to be properly positioned in the market or to receive customer acceptance 
in addition  as a significant number of emc s products are designed to be fully compatible with the computers and operating systems of ibm and others  emc s business could also be adversely affected by modifications in the design or configuration of these computers and operating systems 
risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer demand accurately  the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products  the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced and delays in initial shipments of new products 
further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time 
there can be no assurance that emc will be able to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies 
the markets emc serves are highly competitive  and emc may be unable to compete effectively 
emc competes with many established companies in the computer storage and server industries and certain of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than emc 
emc s business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by its competitors  including hardware  software and services  price reductions of its competitors equipment or services and the implementation of effective marketing strategies by its competitors 
competitive pricing could adversely affect emc s revenues and earnings 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer storage and server markets and have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on emc s revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which emc cannot foresee 
emc currently believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
to date  emc has been able to manage its component and product design costs 
however  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on emc s earnings 
changes in foreign laws  rules or regulations or other conditions could impair emc s international sales 
a substantial portion of emc s revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of emc s products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  emc s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
risks associated with emc s indirect channels of distribution may adversely affect emc s financial results 
emc derives a significant percentage of its product revenues from indirect channels of distribution  including resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
emc s financial results could be adversely affected if its contracts with its indirect channels of distribution were terminated  if emc s relationship with its indirect channels were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of its indirect channels were to weaken 
in addition  as emc s business grows  emc may have an increased reliance on indirect channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels 
if emc is not successful  emc may lose certain sales opportunities 
furthermore  the partial reliance on indirect channels of distribution may materially reduce the visibility to management of potential orders  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such orders 
in addition  there can be no assurance that indirect channels will not develop or market products in competition with emc in the future 
historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact quarterly revenues and earnings 
emc s quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
emc believes this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including the significant size of emc s average product price in relation to its customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences emc s uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
if orders vary substantially from the predicted demand  the ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited  which could adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  emc s revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter  and its backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because emc manufactures its products on the basis of its forecast of near term demand and maintains inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers emc generally ships products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule orders with little or no penalty moreover  delays in product shipping  caused by loss of power or telecommunications or similar services  or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses  could intensify the impact of these factors on emc s business  results of operations and financial condition 
emc may have difficulty sustaining and managing its growth 
emc has a history of rapid growth 
emc s future operating results will depend on its management s ability to manage growth  including  but not limited to  hiring and retaining significant numbers of qualified employees  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing its manufacturing capacity and other assets and executing on its plans 
an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  emc s growth requires enhancement and expansion of its infrastructure  including its management team  information systems and manufacturing operations 
the company s continued success and profitability depends on its ability to continue to improve its infrastructure to keep pace with the growth in its overall business 
emc s business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key personnel 
emc s continued growth and success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees  the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in the high technology industry 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in continuously recruiting new personnel or in retaining existing personnel 
the loss of one or more key or other employees or emc s inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
manufacturing risks could directly impair emc s financial results 
emc s products operate near the limits of electronic and physical performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing were to occur by emc or its suppliers  emc could experience a rate of failure in its products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities and control of material and manufacturing quality and costs are critical factors in the future growth of emc 
emc frequently revises and updates manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes to its products and evaluates the reallocation of manufacturing resources among its facilities 
there can be no assurance that emc s efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for its products will be sufficient to permit emc to avoid a rate of failure in its products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
emc s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
as part of its business strategy  emc seeks to acquire businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business including  among other things the effect of the acquisition on emc s financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further emc s strategies the difficulty of integrating the acquired business the lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies the diversion of emc s management s attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the implementation and maintenance of uniform company wide standards  procedures and policies the potential incompatibility of business cultures these factors could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
emc expects that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock or a combination of these 
to the extent that emc issues shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing stockholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
emc also seeks to invest in businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business 
emc s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances 
emc has alliances with leading software  relational database and enterprise application companies  and emc plans to continue its strategy of developing key alliances 
emc works with these companies to integrate its products with their software applications 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in its ongoing strategic alliances or that emc will be able to find further suitable business relationships as it develops new products 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that companies with which emc has strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than emc  will not develop or market products in competition with emc in the future  discontinue their alliances with emc or form alliances with emc s competitors 
emc s business may suffer if it cannot protect its intellectual property 
emc generally relies upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain emc s proprietary rights in its technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of emc s proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect emc s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to adequately protect its proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect emc s competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct its business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
from time to time  emc receives notices from third parties claiming infringement by emc s products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause emc to incur significant expenses 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting emc from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against emc requiring emc to pay royalties to a third party  and emc fails to develop or license a substitute technology  emc s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
year problems may disrupt emc s business 
the information provided below constitutes a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
in february  emc established a year program to address systems and software problems in interpreting certain dates in calendar year under this program  emc completed  prior to january   an assessment of the hardware and software in its business information systems and completed the necessary modifications 
to date  emc has not experienced  and is not aware of  any year problems or disruptions in its internal systems  however  emc cannot  at this time  be assured that any such problems or disruptions  if they were to occur  would not have a material impact on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
under its year program  emc sought and has received certifications of year compliance from all of its key vendors and suppliers 
emc has also received certifications or statements of year compliance from other vendors and suppliers and has assessed questionnaire responses and related information from other third parties 
to date  emc has not received any notification from any of its key vendors  suppliers or other third parties of any year problems or disruptions  however  emc cannot  at this time  be assured that year problems of third parties will not have a material impact on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
emc has designed and tested the current versions of its symmetrix series of products and the current versions of its other products to be year compliant 
emc has made upgrades available for the older versions of its symmetrix series of products and for certain other of its older products that have not been tested for year compliance so that such products will test as year compliant 
emc s clariion storage products and aviion servers test as year ready or emc has made upgrades available to make such products test as year ready 
there can be no assurance that year problems in emc s products  if they were to occur  would not have a material impact on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the assessment  remediation  testing and contingency planning phases of emc s year program are complete 
the total cost of such program has not had  and emc does not anticipate that the total cost of such program will have  a material effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding failures to interpret certain dates in calendar year would include a hardware failure  the corruption or loss of data contained in emc s internal information systems  a failure affecting emc s key vendors  suppliers or customers  the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies or other third parties  and customer dissatisfaction related to the performance of emc s products 
under its program  emc developed a year contingency plan 
this contingency plan includes  among other things  manual work arounds for hardware and software failures  as well as substitution of systems  if required 
further information about emc s year readiness is available at the company s website at http www 
emc 
com year litigation that emc may become involved in may adversely affect emc 
in the ordinary course of business  emc may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause emc to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations could adversely affect emc 
emc s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to emc or its products were newly implemented or changed 
emc s stock price is volatile 
emc s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by emc or its competitors quarterly variations in its operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community in addition  emc s stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to emc s performance 
because of these factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  the company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  the company s primary exposures related to sales denominated in the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
additionally  the company s exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia  has recently increased because of its expanding presence in these markets 
despite the relative size of the company s exposures in these markets  the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact the company s financial results 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  the company uses these derivative instruments to reduce its foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments held by the company are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses a combination of option and forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
the hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the company employs a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for its combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  interest rate risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and all are denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
a portion of the company s investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities which are subject to prepayment risk 
the company employs a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for its combined investment portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the investment portfolios was million as of december  credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable 
the company places its temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limits the amount of investment with any one financial institution 
the credit risk associated with trade receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas
