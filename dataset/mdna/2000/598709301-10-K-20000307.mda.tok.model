micro carbide tools  now produced at our data flute cnc facility  add carbide reamers  step drills and miniature tools to our product mix 
in addition to our machine tool divestiture  in december  we sold our electronic systems division esd 
milacron continues to develop and maintain our own applications software 
the decision to sell esd was made to redeploy assets to more strategic businesses 
additionally  we sold our european plastics extrusion machinery business in december  headquartered in vienna  austria  the business had sales to unaffiliated customers of approximately million in  principally to markets in europe  asia and south america 
the business was sold to redeploy assets to more strategic businesses 
we will continue to operate our north american extrusion machinery business  which is headquartered in southwest ohio and serves markets in the us  canada and central america 
cost cutting and efficiency initiatives in operating our businesses  we continually search for opportunities to reduce our operating costs and improve the efficiency of our operations 
in the second half of  we announced two major initiatives in this area 
first  we implemented a plan to consolidate uniloy s european blow molding operations in a new manufacturing facility located near milan  italy 
the plan involves the closure of three plants in florence and milan  italy and berlin  germany and the transfer of the manufacturing and assembly operations at those plants to the new  more modern facility near milan and to another existing plant located in the czech republic 
the consolidation  which is expected to be completed by september   will not adversely affect future sales revenues but is expected to result in annual pretax cost savings of approximately million 
in december   we implemented a second plan to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs at additional businesses 
the actions contemplated by the plan involve both segments operations in north america and europe 
the plan involves the closure of four smaller manufacturing facilities  the operations of which will be transferred to other locations  and the elimination of approximately manufacturing and administrative positions worldwide 
the total cost of the plan  which is expected to be completed by the end of  will be approximately million 
completion of the plan is expected to result in annual pretax cost savings of more than million which will phase in during and be fully realized in the above actions are in addition to the cost reduction actions in prior years that are discussed above 
we also reduced total selling and administrative expense from of sales in to in product development and capital expenditures as part of our objective to enhance milacron s growth potential and global competitiveness  we continue to invest in research and development and in new capital equipment 
research and development investment in totaled million  or of sales 
research and development expense totaled million in and million in in  we invested over million for capital additions  primarily to install advanced technology and increase productivity throughout our operations worldwide 
additional assets having a value of million were financed through operating leases 
for  we are budgeting an additional million in capital expenditures 
to enhance our research and development effort  we have maintained a major program for product development  process improvement and modernization 
this program is named wolfpack because of its emphasis on teamwork and fierce competitiveness 
the objectives of wolfpack are to design and produce new products at world competitive levels of quality  performance  efficiency and cost 
substantially all of milacron s current plastics technologies machine designs have been developed using the wolfpack methodology 
plastics technologies business we believe milacron is the largest and broadest line us producer of plastics machinery and one of the three largest in the world  as well as the largest us producer of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the moldmaking industry 
in  milacron s plastics technologies segment s sales were million 
our plastics technologies business sells plastics machinery and supplies for processing plastics to manufacturers in several key industries  including packaging  construction  consumer goods  automotive  electronics and medical 
we believe milacron offers more varieties of machinery to process plastic than any other us company 
one of our strengths in the plastics machinery business is that we offer complete lines of machines for three major plastics processing technologies injection molding and systems for extrusion and blow molding 
another strength is our presence in the durable goods market with the production of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the moldmaking industry 
milacron also sells specialty auxiliary equipment for plastics processing and rebuilds and retrofits older injection molding equipment manufactured by milacron or others 
we distribute most of our plastics machinery products through a combination of a direct sales force and independent agents who are geographically spread throughout our key markets 
we sell our mold bases  supplies and components through a direct distribution network in the us and europe and through a large network of joint venture sales and service offices in asia 
our plastics technologies businesses sell products primarily in north america and europe 
approximately of the group s sales were to customers located in the eleven european countries which are participating in a new common currency  the euro 
to date  the introduction of the euro has not caused any material changes in our competitive position in the plastics industry or the operation of the business 
while the future impact of the euro is uncertain  management does not expect the introduction of the euro to have a material effect on the business in the foreseeable future 
plastics technologies industry the market for plastics machinery and supplies for processing plastics has grown steadily over the past four decades 
plastics have continued to replace traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper in an increasing number of manufactured products  particularly in the packaging  transportation  construction  housewares  electrical  and medical industries 
advancements in both the development of materials  which make plastic products more functional  and the capabilities of plastics processing equipment have been major contributors to the steady growth in the plastics technologies market 
in addition  consumer demand for safer  more convenient and recyclable products has increased the general demand for plastic products 
like other capital goods markets  machines within the plastics technologies market are subject to economic cycles 
in particular  the market for injection molding machines is driven by resin prices and production  the consumer economy and the packaging  construction and automotive industries 
custom molders  which produce a wide variety of components for many industries  are a major group of plastics technologies customers 
other customer categories include the packaging  construction  consumer goods  automotive  electrical and medical supplies industries 
among the factors that affect the plastics technologies market are the health of the consumer economy  residential and commercial construction  automotive production and the introduction of new models in the automotive industry 
because of intense competition from international plastics technologies producers  currency exchange rates also have a significant impact 
fluctuations in the prices of petrochemical feed stocks for resin and the subsequent supply of resin may affect the businesses of our customers and  in turn  the markets for our products 
environmental concerns about plastics could slow the growth of the plastics technologies market 
however  some plastics raw material suppliers  machinery makers and processors are developing methods of recycling to address environmental issues 
we believe that environmental concerns have not had any discernible negative effect on the market to date 
nevertheless  milacron  through its membership in the society of plastics industry an industry trade association and this association s affiliate  the american plastics council  is working with other leading companies within the plastics industry to address the role of plastics in the environment 
milacron s plastics technologies business milacron s plastics technologies segment consists of four principal product lines injection molding machines ferromatik milacron  blow molding systems uniloy milacron  extrusion systems extrusiontek milacron  and standardized mold bases  components and supplies for the plastics injection moldmaking industry d m e 
we also sell a variety of specialty equipment used in the processing of plastics 
injection molding ferromatik milacron 
we believe milacron is the largest us producer of injection molding machines 
injection molding is the most common and versatile method of processing plastic  and it is used to make a wide variety of parts and products ranging from housewares and consumer goods to medical supplies and industrial components 
milacron manufactures many types of injection molding machines  almost all of which were developed using wolfpack principles 
our injection molding machine line includes machines powered conventionally with hydraulics as well as ones that are driven by servo motors fully electric 
product standardization which facilitates part commonality and the modernization of our manufacturing facilities and methods  as well as increased volumes  have enabled us to achieve significant economies of scale for the production of injection molding machines 
we believe these factors have enabled milacron to become the lowest cost us producer of these machines 
in november   milacron acquired ferromatik  one of europe s leading producers of injection molding machines 
ferromatik is recognized for its high end technology  including multi color machines  multi component systems and other specialty applications 
the acquisition included the ferromatik lines of hydraulic and electric injection molding machines and a modern manufacturing facility in malterdingen  germany  as well as ferromatik s marketing  sales and service network 
this acquisition expanded our plastics processing technology base and product line and enabled us to achieve our objective of establishing a plastics machinery manufacturing and distribution base in germany to serve europe and other markets 
ferromatik has provided a complementary fit with milacron s other injection molding machine businesses 
shortly after the acquisition  we completed a restructuring of ferromatik designed to derive synergies between ferromatik and other milacron operations and to improve ferromatik s operations through the implementation of manufacturing techniques and methods used in our us plastics technologies operations 
the restructuring reduced overall marketing costs through the consolidation of milacron s former european marketing organization into the ferromatik marketing organization 
we believe that this restructuring has helped  and will continue to help  us achieve our cost reduction goals in both marketing and manufacturing 
in may   milacron announced the formation of a joint venture  cincinnati milacron ltd 
cml  with a group of individuals experienced in the building of plastics machinery in ahmedabad  india 
this operation builds injection molding machines for domestic and world markets 
in  cml completed the implementation of its product introductions and opened sales offices in major cities of india

milacron also gained a stronger european presence with the acquisition 
as discussed above  in  we implemented a plan to consolidate uniloy s european operations in a new facility to improve efficiency and reduce the overall cost structure 
consolidation in the dairy industry had a negative effect on uniloy s sales of hdpe systems for milk containers  uniloy s single largest market  during we expect the effects of this consolidation to continue through extrusion systems extrusiontek milacron 
milacron s extrusion systems business consists of the manufacture  sale and distribution of individual extruders both single screw and twin screw and systems comprised of multiple units which are tooled to extrude a specific product in quantity 
such systems take longer to manufacture than injection molding machines 
extrusion systems  which we manufacture in the us  include twin screw extruders and single screw extruders 
we believe we have a strong competitive position in each of these lines 
twin screw extruders are used to produce continuous flow products such as pipe  residential siding  sheet and window frames

sales  marketing and customer service our metalworking technologies business generally sells its products under multiple brands through parallel market channels  using direct sales  industrial distributors  agents and manufacturers representatives  as well as industrial catalog sales 
most of our sales are of products that we manufacture and sell under company owned brands 
in addition  we sell our products under the brand names of other companies through their own market channels 
we also use milacron brand names to sell products that are made by other companies 
at the beginning of  we launched milpro 
com  a business to business commercial website for the metalworking industry offering customers more than  tools  fluids and abrasives 
our milpro initiative originally had as its primary focus the more than  small metalworking jobs shops in the us however  we believe that electronic commerce has the potential to become a significant source of revenue from customers of all sizes large and small within three to five years 
competition we have many competitors for metalcutting tools but only two have higher worldwide sales 
our main global competitors in metalworking fluids are large petrochemical companies and smaller companies specializing in similar fluids 
there are a few large competitors in the us grinding wheel market  one of which is significantly larger than milacron 
principal competitive factors in these markets include market coverage  technology  performance  delivery  price and customer service 
patents milacron holds a number of patents  none of which is material to any business segment 
employees milacron employed an average of  people in  of whom  were employed outside the us as of year end  we employed  people

one of these plants was closed late in in connection with our recently announced program to improve operating efficiency see restructuring costs 
effective september   we acquired master unit die products  inc  a leading north american manufacturer of quick change mold bases for the plastics industry 
master unit die products had annual sales of approximately million as of the acquisition date 
also on september   we acquired the assets of uniloy  the plastics machinery division of johnson controls  inc  for approximately million 
uniloy  which is known for its uniloy brand of equipment  as well as various other brands  had sales of more than million for its fiscal year ending on september   and is one of the world s leading providers of blow molding machines  as well as structural foam systems  aftermarket parts  services and molds for blow molding 
on december   we acquired werkzeugfabrik gmbh k nigsee werk  a manufacturer of high speed steel drills and taps 
located in eastern germany  werk had annual sales of approximately million as of the acquisition date 
with the exception of werk  all of the businesses purchased in are included in the plastics technologies segment from the respective dates of acquisition 
werk is included in the metalworking technologies segment 
in  we acquired two businesses data flute cnc in june and minnesota twist drill in september 
both businesses are included in the metalworking technologies segment and had annual sales of approximately million as of the respective acquisition dates 
all of the acquisitions discussed above were financed through available cash and bank borrowings and have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
presence outside the us in recent years  milacron s growth outside the us has allowed it to become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of the company s geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was weaker in relation to the us dollar than in because of the comparative strength of the dollar  we experienced unfavorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively  in relation to the effects on operating earnings and net earnings were not significant 
between december  and december   the euro weakened against the dollar by approximately 
this resulted in a million reduction in consolidated shareholders equity due to unfavorable foreign translation adjustments 
if the euro should weaken further against the dollar in future periods  we will once again experience a negative effect in translating our non us new orders  sales  and possibly  net earnings when compared to historical results 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in as discussed above  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of reducing new orders by million  while acquisitions contributed an incremental million in relation to excluding currency effects and acquisitions  consolidated new orders decreased by million  or 
orders for plastics technologies products increased by million  or  to million due to the effects of the and acquisitions which contributed an incremental million in relation to without the acquisitions and currency effects  the segment s new orders were essentially flat 
orders for extrusion systems increased  particularly in the us  while orders for injection molding machines decreased worldwide for much of the year due to lower industrial production levels  higher resin prices and unfavorable currency effects 
however  business levels began to improve in the fourth quarter 
in the metalworking technologies segment  new orders were million in  which is essentially flat in relation to million in acquisitions contributed an incremental million of orders while currency effects reduced orders by million in relation to orders for widia metalcutting tools in europe and grinding wheels in north america decreased 
orders for round tools increased due to the werk acquisition but were penalized by reduced demand in the us due to softness in the aerospace market 
consolidated us export orders were million in representing a increase from million in uniloy more than accounted for the increase as export orders for injection molding machines decreased 
the company s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december  this compares to million at december  and million at december  sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in currency effects reduced consolidated sales by million in relation to  while acquisitions contributed an incremental million 
excluding these effects  consolidated sales decreased by million  or 
in the plastics technologies segment  sales were million  representing a million  or  increase in relation to the and acquisitions more than accounted for the increase in sales 
sales of injection molding machines decreased worldwide due in part to the aforementioned softness in worldwide markets  while sales of extrusion systems increased 
consolidation in the dairy industry had a negative effect on the sales of certain uniloy products  a trend that we expect to continue through sales of the metalworking technologies segment were million compared to million in acquisitions contributed million of incremental sales in  while currency effects reduced reported sales by million 
excluding these effects  sales decreased by million  or  due principally to reduced shipments of widia products in europe and round metalworking tools in north america 
consolidated export sales were million in compared to million in uniloy more than accounted for the increase 
sales of both segments to non us markets totaled million  an increase in of million 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated of sales in and of sales in margins  costs and expenses the consolidated manufacturing margin was in compared to in margins decreased in the plastics technologies segment due principally to reduced shipments of injection molding machines and inefficiencies at uniloy s european operations 
in september   we announced a plan to improve efficiency at uniloy by closing three plants and consolidating its european manufacturing operations at a new facility in italy 
margins also decreased in the metalworking technologies segment  particularly at widia and for round tools 
as discussed more fully below  in december   we implemented a plan to improve manufacturing efficiency at various operations in both segments 
we believe that these measures  together with expected higher sales of injection molding machines and certain other key product lines  will result in improved margins in total selling and administrative expense was essentially unchanged in amount in relation to but decreased significantly as a percentage of sales 
selling expense decreased in amount by million despite higher sales volume due to aggressive cost reduction efforts 
administrative expense increased due to the inclusion of uniloy and the other acquisitions but decreased as a percentage of sales 
other expense net decreased from million in to million in the amount includes higher goodwill amortization expense due principally to the uniloy acquisition 
the net decrease resulted principally from the absence of severance expenses totaling approximately million related to approximately employees at widia and at our extrusion machinery facility in austria in these actions were made to adjust staffing levels to current sales projections and as a result of plant modernization and process improvements 
interest expense net  including amortization of debt issuance costs  increased in due primarily to higher average debt levels to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions and the repurchase of common shares in early and late restructuring costs in  we implemented two separate initiatives to improve operating efficiency and strengthen synergies between certain recently acquired businesses and our previously existing operations 
these actions had the effect of reducing pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of by million million after tax 
in september  we announced a formal plan to consolidate uniloy s european blow molding operations in a new manufacturing facility located near milan  italy 
at the time uniloy was acquired  we recognized the need for improved efficiency within uniloy s european operations and immediately thereafter began to evaluate various options for the purpose of identifying the optimal long term solution 
through that process  it was determined that three manufacturing plants located in florence and milan  italy and berlin  germany would be closed and that the manufacturing and assembly operations at those plants would be consolidated into a more modern plant in italy or transferred to another plant located in the czech republic 
in the second quarter of  we began to develop a detailed plan for the plant closures and consolidation  which was formally approved by management in august   and publicly announced in september  the total cost of the plan  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of and which is scheduled to be completed by september   is expected to be million 
of this amount  million is included in a reserve established in the allocation of the uniloy acquisition cost 
the remaining million is being charged to expense as the related costs are incurred  including 
million in the fourth quarter of charges against the million reserve during the fourth quarter were 
million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations since the acquisition date have had the effect of reducing the reserve by 
million 
the total cash cost of the consolidation will be approximately million  which is net of the expected proceeds from the sale of two facilities in italy 
the consolidation will not adversely affect future sales revenue and is expected to result in annual pretax cost savings of approximately million  which will begin to phase in during the first half of in december  we implemented a second plan to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs at additional businesses 
the actions contemplated by the plan involve both segments operations in north america and europe 
the plan involves the closure of four smaller manufacturing facilities  the operations of which will be transferred to other locations  and the elimination of approximately manufacturing and administrative positions worldwide 
the total cost of implementing the plan is expected to be million  including million in and million in of the amount  million is included in a reserve for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that was recorded in the fourth quarter 
charges against this reserve through the end of the year totaled 
million 
the total cost of the plan also includes charges of million for supplemental early retirement benefits for certain employees that will be funded through pension plans and million for additional costs that are being charged to expense as incurred 
of the latter amount  
million was incurred in the fourth quarter of the total cash cost of the plan  including capital expenditures of million  is expected to be approximately million  most of which will be expended in completion of the plan is expected to result in annual pretax cost savings of more than million  which will gradually phase in during and be fully realized in as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings for  the line captioned restructuring costs includes the following components restructuring costs in millions accrual for termination benefits and facility exit costs supplemental retirement benefits other costs 
costs related to uniloy consolidation 
the status of the reserves for the two initiatives discussed above is summarized in the following table 
restructuring reserves beginning ending in millions balance change balance uniloy consolidation termination benefits facility exit costs

total reserves divestiture of business in december   we sold our european extrusion machinery business  which is headquartered in vienna  austria  for cash proceeds of million subject to post closing adjustments 
the pretax gain on the sale was million million after tax 
the european extrusion business had sales to unaffiliated customers of million in  principally to markets in europe  asia and south america 
the business was sold to redeploy assets to other more strategic businesses 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority shareholders interests earnings from continuing operations  including the gain on the sale of the european extrusion business and the charges for restructuring costs  were million in compared to million in excluding these two items  pretax earnings were million in several factors contributed to the decrease including higher interest expense and goodwill amortization expense 
lower operating earnings for injection molding machines and round metalworking tools also held back profitability 
these factors were partially offset by the absence of the severance expenses that are discussed above and by our aggressive actions to control selling and administrative costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in and includes us federal and state and local income taxes and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us milacron entered both and with sizable net operating loss nol carryforwards in certain non us jurisdictions  along with valuation allowances against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we review valuation allowances periodically based on the relative amount of positive and negative evidence available at the time 
this is done for the purpose of reaching conclusions regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are then adjusted accordingly 
the resulting decreases or increases in valuation allowances serve to favorably or unfavorably affect our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in the rate for is lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the adjustment of income tax reserves to more accurately reflect actual expected liabilities 
these benefits were partially offset by the downward adjustment of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in germany to a lower rate 
net adjustments of valuation allowances based on the process described above did not materially affect the effective tax rate but was the principal reason that the effective rate was less than the statutory rate 
the effective tax rate for is expected to increase to within a range of approximately 
however  the tax rate will ultimately be contingent on the mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations  after minority shareholders interests  were million  or per share diluted  in compared with million  or per share diluted  in the decrease resulted principally from higher interest and goodwill amortization expense  soft market conditions for certain businesses and a slightly higher effective tax rate 
discontinued operations in  discontinued operations reflects the loss on the sale of the machine tools segment  which was sold on october   and its operating results through the date of sale 
net earnings for  net earnings were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the most significant factor affecting the net earnings comparison was the loss on the sale of the machine tools segment 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in excluding the effect of acquisitions  new orders were million higher in orders for plastics technologies products increased by million  or 
excluding the acquisitions  orders increased by approximately 
orders for metalworking technologies products increased by million  or 
excluding the effects of the acquisitions  new orders were flat  due principally to the general motors strike 
us export orders were million in representing a increase from million in uniloy accounted for almost one third of the increase 
the company s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december  this compares to million at december   and million at december  sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in excluding the effect of acquisitions  consolidated sales decreased modestly in relation to sales of plastics technologies products increased by million  or 
the segment s sales include an incremental million related to the acquisitions 
sales of metalworking technologies products increased by million  or  excluding the effect of the acquisitions  sales in approximated the amount 
export sales were million in compared to million in the amount includes million for uniloy 
sales of both segments to non us markets  including exports  totaled million  a decrease in of million 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
margins  costs and expenses the manufacturing margin percent of in increased from in margins for both segments showed improvement in both the us and in europe 
in  margins in the plastics technologies segment had been held back by pricing pressure on us built injection molding machines  which began to ease in the third quarter of that year 
total selling and administrative expense increased in amount in relation to however  these expenses decreased modestly in as a percentage of sales due to increased sales volume 
other expense net  including amortization of goodwill  increased to million in from million in the amount includes severance expenses totaling approximately million relating to approximately employees at widia  the company s european cutting tool company  and at the company s extrusion machinery facility in austria  which was subsequently sold in as a result of these and other actions at widia and in austria  we achieved annualized pretax savings of approximately million  which began to phase in during the fourth quarter of for widia and which phased in during in austria 
the expense included severance expense of approximately million relating to ferromatik  the company s german injection molding machine subsidiary 
annual cost savings from this and other cost reduction measures at ferromatik are approximately million 
the severance actions at widia and in austria in and at ferromatik in were made to adjust staffing levels based on sales projections and as a result of plant modernization and improvements in manufacturing processes at these locations 
in addition  the installation of integrated computer software at widia s european operations made additional staffing reductions possible 
most of the positions eliminated were direct manufacturing and factory overhead positions  although some of the terminations occurred in sales support and administrative areas 
interest expense net  including amortization of debt issuance costs  increased in due primarily to higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority shareholders interests earnings before income taxes and minority shareholders interests of million in exceeded the million earned in by million  or 
as a percentage of sales  pretax earnings improved significantly from to  which is largely the result of improved manufacturing margins as discussed above 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in and includes us federal and state and local income taxes and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us milacron entered both years with sizable net operating loss nol carryforwards  along with valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and reversed when it is determined to be more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
the reversal of these valuation allowances serves to reduce the effective tax rate 
valuation allowances subject to future reversal were million at year end  including million related to werk 
the consolidated effective tax rate for was compared to in  which in both cases is less than the us federal statutory rate 
the most significant factor in both years was the reversal of valuation allowances commensurate with our current expectations regarding the realization of net operating loss carryforwards 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations  net of minority shareholders interests  were million  or per share diluted  in compared with million  or per share diluted  in the increase in earnings was caused by improved operating margins offset by higher interest cost and a higher effective tax rate 
discontinued operations in  discontinued operations includes a provision for the loss on the sale of mtg of million  or 
per share diluted  and after tax earnings from its operations of million  or 
per share diluted 
net earnings for  net earnings were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the most significant items affecting the net earnings comparison between years were the loss on the sale of mtg and its lower operating earnings in prior to the sale 
year the term year problem yk refers to processing difficulties that may occur in information technology it systems and other equipment with embedded microprocessors that were designed without considering the distinction between dates in the s and the s 
each of milacron s business units  as well as our corporate headquarters  was responsible for developing and executing comprehensive plans to minimize and  to the extent possible  eliminate any major business interruptions that could have been caused by the yk issue 
milacron s yk effort focused primarily on three important elements it systems  it equipment that includes embedded microprocessors  and supplier and infrastructure preparedness 
milacron estimates that the incremental cost of major system implementations and remediation projects was approximately million  including million for newer  more modern systems 
these costs did not have a material effect on milacron s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems 
we are not aware of any material yk problems associated with our products or the products and services of third parties 
we will  however  continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide uninterrupted service throughout the year to ensure that any potential yk matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk milacron uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   milacron had outstanding forward contracts totaling million compared to million at december  the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in currency rates on milacron s foreign exchange contracts at december  or would not significantly affect milacron s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk at december   milacron had fixed interest rate debt of million  including million of notes due may  and million of notes due march  we also had floating rate debt totaling million  with interest fluctuating based primarily on changes in libor 
at december   fixed rate debt totaled million and floating rate debt totaled million 
we also sell up to million of accounts receivable under our receivables purchase agreement  which results in financing fees that fluctuate based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result  annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuate based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
the potential loss on floating rate debt instruments from a hypothetical change in interest rates would be approximately million at december  and million at december  liquidity and sources of capital at december   milacron had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million in the amount includes the million received in connection with the sale of the european extrusion business  most of which was used to repay bank borrowings early in operating activities provided million of cash in  compared with million provided in the increase in cash provided resulted primarily from steps taken to better align production with demand and to improve inventory management 
in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash  due to capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million  the effects of which were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the european extrusion business 
in  investing activities used million of cash  including capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million  including million for uniloy acquisition 
in  cash flows from investing activities benefited by million from the sale of mtg 
financing activities used million of cash in  compared with million of cash provided in additional borrowings  net of repayments  provided million of cash in  while dividends and common share repurchases used million of cash 
in  we announced a two million common share repurchase program  of which million shares were repurchased through december  the remainder of shares were repurchased in the first quarter of including shares repurchased to meet the current needs of management incentive plans and the repurchase of 
million additional treasury shares in the fourth quarter  milacron used million of cash for share repurchases in in february   we announced that milacron s board of directors had authorized the repurchase up to four million additional common shares on the open market beginning in the first quarter of the year 
as of december  and  milacron s current ratio was as of december   milacron had lines of credit with various us and non us banks of approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
under the provisions of the facility  our additional borrowing capacity totaled approximately million at december  total debt was million at december   representing an increase of million from december  total shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase resulted principally from net earnings of million  which more than offset million of unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments  dividend payments and the effects of the share repurchase program 
the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity was at december  and substantially all of the proceeds from the sale of our european extrusion machinery business were used to repay borrowings under lines of credit early in  which reduced the ratio of total debt to total capital to less than
