item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary orasolv and durasolv technologies 
we have agreements with several pharmaceutical companies regarding a variety of potential products  with an emphasis on prescription products 
we currently manufacture five commercial products using our fast dissolve technologies 
these products include triaminic for novartis  tempra for bristol meyers squibb and zomig for astrazeneca 
we operate within a single segment pharmaceutical product development 
our revenues are comprised of three components net sales of products utilizing our proprietary fast dissolve technologies  product development fees and licensing revenues for development activities we conduct through collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies  and royalties on the sales of products we manufacture  which are sold by pharmaceutical companies under licenses from us 
in addition  we are currently developing other drug delivery technologies 
revenues from product sales and from royalties will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  demand for our products by patients  new product introductions  the seasonal nature of some of our products and pharmaceutical company ordering patterns 
our ability to generate product sales and royalty revenues in excess of our current forecast for and may be constrained by our manufacturing capacity 
we expect our second production line  now being developed  to be operational in the second half of revenues from product development fees and licensing revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  the number of new collaborative agreements that we enter into  the number of product development milestones we achieve under collaborative agreements  including making submissions to  and obtaining approvals from  the fda for products in development  and the level of our development activity conducted for pharmaceutical companies under collaborative agreements 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
our total revenues were million in  as compared to million in and million in the increases in revenues in each year are due principally to increased development activity for new products that resulted in significantly higher product development fees and licensing revenue 
in  total revenues also increased due to higher sales volume of commercial products 
revenues from net sales of products using our drug delivery technologies totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase from to was due to increased shipments to novartis that began in the second quarter of the decrease from to was due to the decision by a pharmaceutical company to discontinue us distribution of a product line 
we expect revenues from net sales of products using our drug delivery technologies to increase in due to anticipated shipments and pricing increases 
product development fees and licensing revenues totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase from to was due to our increased development activity for proposed new products and the achievement of development milestones for nv organon and astrazeneca 
the increase from to was due to our increased development activity for proposed new products and the achievement of development milestones for novartis  astrazeneca and schering plough 
royalties totaled million in  as compared to million in  and we received no royalty revenue in the increase from to was due to increased sales by novartis of triaminic 
royalties paid by bristol myers squibb in and on sales of tempra were based on annual minimum contractual payments  which will expire in we expect royalties to increase in operating expenses and gross margin 
cost of sales totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase from to was principally due to an increase in sales of triaminic products to novartis 
cost of sales from to were approximately the same even though production unit volumes decreased  principally due to an increase in manufacturing overhead in gross margins on product sales from through were negative because we had significant excess production capacity and product sales for each of these years did not cover fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
we expect to be operating at or near full production capacity until our second production line is operational  which is expected in the second half of we expect our gross margins to improve in due to anticipated price increases on an existing product line and expected unit volume increases 
future gross margins will depend principally on the pricing of our products  our ability to effectively use our manufacturing and plant capacity  and changes in our product lines and mix of products 
research and product development expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase from to was principally a result of our increased development activity on fast dissolve prescription products for nv organon and american home products 
from to  these expenses were consistent  as the level of product development activities between years was comparable 
we expect these expenses to increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in the decline in these expenses year over year was due primarily to a restructuring of management responsibilities  which began in and ended in  resulting in a general reduction in management headcount and related expenses 
we expect these expenses to increase in other income 
other income was million in and  and million in other income consists primarily of interest income on invested funds  net of interest expense on bank lines  loan agreements and capitalized leases 
other income has declined since as we used cash to fund business operations and our level of invested funds decreased 
we expect other income to increase beginning in the second quarter of  as a result of our sale in march of common stock in a private placement  described below 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through private and public sales of equity securities and revenues from product sales  product development fees and licensing revenue and royalties 
net working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase from to was principally due to the positive effect of a million loan we received from a pharmaceutical company partner  which was partially offset by approximately million in expenditures for capital improvements to our manufacturing facility 
we invest excess cash in interest bearing money market accounts 
we signed a one year secured revolving line of credit agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc in july the agreement provided a credit facility of million  primarily for working capital purposes  secured principally by inventories and accounts receivable 
at the end of  we owed the lender approximately million 
we repaid the lender all amounts borrowed in january and notified the lender in march that we would not renew the agreement in july  thus terminating the facility s availability 
in december  we received a million unsecured loan from one of our pharmaceutical company partners 
we may repay this loan at any time  but if the loan is not repaid by the time we are due royalties under a license agreement with an affiliate of the lender  the affiliate may offset up to half of the royalties otherwise due to us and the lender will treat the amount offset by its affiliate as a payment by us on this loan 
interest is payable on the outstanding balance of the loan at libor plus one half of one percent 
interest accrues quarterly and is added to the then outstanding principal balance of the loan 
in march  we issued million shares of common stock through a private placement 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds and expect to use the funds for capital additions to our manufacturing facility and for working capital 
we have invested the net proceeds in interest bearing money market accounts  pending such uses 
we currently expect to spend approximately to million during and to complete various manufacturing facility improvements  including construction of a coating unit and a second production line 
we expect to finance the costs of construction with the proceeds of the private placement of common stock described above 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  together with the net proceeds from the private placement of common stock and expected revenues from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may elect to pursue additional financing at any time to more aggressively pursue development of new drug delivery technologies and expand manufacturing capacity beyond that currently planned 
in addition  other factors that will affect future capital requirements and may require us to seek additional financing  include the level of expenditures necessary to develop new products or technologies  the progress of our research and product development programs  the need to construct a larger than currently anticipated manufacturing facility to meet demand for our products  results of our collaborative efforts with current and potential pharmaceutical company partners  and the timing of and amounts received from future product sales  product development fees and licensing revenue and royalties 
we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  on acceptable terms 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning in we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that license and other up front fees received from research collaborators be recognized over the term of the agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
we have not completed our analysis of the impact of implementing sab on the reporting of our product development fees and licensing revenue  but expect to complete this analysis by the end of the first quarter of we currently expect to implement sab in the first quarter of  if applicable  and estimate that the cumulative effect of any resulting accounting change will be in the range of to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments consist of debt securities with contractual maturities of less than one year 
therefore  we do not believe our operations are exposed to significant market risk relating to interest rates
