the net credit resulted from a tax benefit of million and an after tax charge of million million before tax

net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash at beginning of year effect of pooling restatement 
cash at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash has been provided from operating activities 
the increases in cash from operations during fiscal and are principally the result of higher earnings and non cash charges depreciation and amortization partially offset by increased working capital requirements 
the company s investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software that support the company s expanding global commercial operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
the company s investments also include several acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during fiscal through as described above  a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
during fiscal the company  issued million of notes due in proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay million of notes due april liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at march   million at april  and million at april  during this period  the company s earnings have added substantially to equity

in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements

this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors

the company s european operations has completed the development of the infrastructure that provides all the internal systems functionality required to deal with the euro during the transition period and thereafter 
the transition period lasts until july when the national currencies will no longer be legal tender

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company has fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by ensuring costs to service contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
if necessary  the company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
the company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical ten percent increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at march   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
