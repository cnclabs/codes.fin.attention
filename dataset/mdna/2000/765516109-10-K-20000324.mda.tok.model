net worth as of december  has increased to million from at december  the company s long term debt including the current portion was million at december   a increase of million from december  in addition  amounts due under lines of credit totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increases in borrowings are primarily due to the acquisition activity in cash flow from operations was million in  which compares with million and million of negative cash flow from operations for and  respectively 
the company was thus  able to make the million of acquisitions see item business acquisitions by increasing its debt by only million  while internally generating the funds needed to support expansion of its existing operations 
the increase in cash flow from operations was attributed to improved operating profits before interest and taxes which increased to million from million last year and to increased focus on improving inventory turns and tighter control over receivables 
the company continues to rely on short term borrowings to finance its working capital 
during the first quarter of each year  century s working capital requirements are at a low point with short term borrowings of during the second quarter  working capital requirements begin to expand and by july of each year the amount necessary to carry the working capital expands to approximately million 
from july through the remainder of the year  receivable balances are liquidated  releasing substantial amounts of cash that may be used to reduce short term debt 
by december  working capital increased approximately million to million from million in this increase was attributed primarily to lower debt relative to the working capital partially offset by costs associated with the acquisitions 
net worth to total capitalization improved to at december  from as of a year earlier 
it is expected that the company will continue to rely on short term borrowings to fund its future growth  which may increase the company s leverage 
it should be noted that the amount of debt will grow at a slower rate since the company expects to reinvest its available funds and to keep focused on improving inventory utilization and maintaining tight controls on receivables 
at january   the company has sufficient credit facilities and cash flow to meet its obligations as they come due 
while the company has continued to generate sufficient cash to liquidate its term and subordinated debt as it becomes due  and make acquisitions necessary for its growth  there is no assurance  given the high degree of leverage  the seasonality of its principal business and the strong construction economy that existed in  that it can continue to do so in the future 
year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  including those embedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize the year or process data which includes it  potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or operational malfunctions or failures 
as of march  the company s computer systems are year compliant in all material respects and there have been no operational malfunctions or failures due to year conversion
