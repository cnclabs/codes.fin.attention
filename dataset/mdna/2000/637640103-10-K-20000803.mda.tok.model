item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto results of operations the company recorded net sales of billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the growth in sales for fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to improvement in market conditions for the semiconductor industry 
as a result  the company continued to experience better than expected growth in new orders in all regions 
the decline in sales for fiscal from sales in fiscal was caused by significant price reductions in the cyrix pc microprocessor line of products combined with the lack of successful new product introductions from the network products group 
lower sales were also heavily driven by a general slowdown in new orders the company experienced  particularly in the first half of fiscal the company recorded net income of million compared to net losses of billion in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net income was driven by improved operating results  reflecting the effects of the company s decision to exit the cyrix pc microprocessor business  the growth in sales of non pc microprocessor products and the benefits of cost reduction actions that were announced in may of fiscal special items and certain other net gains also contributed to the improvement in fiscal net income 
for fiscal  net income included special items of million 
the special items included a million gain from the sale of assets of the cyrix pc microprocessor business see note  a million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of algorex inc see note  a credit of million related to restructuring of operations see note and an million credit related to an indemnity agreement with fairchild semiconductor that expired in march see note 
in addition to these special items  net income included a million gain from the sale of shares of fairchild stock held by the company and an extraordinary loss of million net of taxes of million 
the shares of fairchild stock were sold as part of an initial public offering and a secondary offering that fairchild completed in august and february  respectively 
the extraordinary loss was recorded in connection with the redemption of the company s percent convertible subordinated notes due see note 
the loss in fiscal included million attributable to special charges for restructuring of operations 
the remaining loss was primarily driven by lower sales and margin erosion mainly due to lower factory utilization and price reductions  particularly in the cyrix pc microprocessor products 
the restructuring charges in fiscal included million related to the company s decision in may to exit the cyrix pc microprocessor business and million related to the consolidation of the wafer manufacturing operations in greenock  scotland see note 
these amounts were partially offset by a credit of million from reserves that were no longer required related to prior restructure actions completed during the year 
in addition to the restructure charges  fiscal operating results included million in charges related to the exit of the cyrix pc microprocessor business 
the charges included million against sales for product returns  million included in cost of sales for the write down of cyrix microprocessor inventory and million included in selling  general and administrative expenses for accounts receivable allowances 
a million charge for costs associated with the termination of a wafer manufacturing and marketing agreement between cyrix and ibm see note was also included in cost of sales for fiscal sales the increase in overall sales for the year was a result of significantly higher volumes  which more than offset lower average selling prices experienced across the company s product offerings 
sales growth  excluding the cyrix pc microprocessor products  was percent over sales for fiscal the following discussion is based on the company s operating segments described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the analog segment  whose sales now represent percent of the company s total sales  drove the growth in sales 
in fiscal  analog product sales grew percent over sales for fiscal this growth was driven by significantly higher unit volume  but was partially offset by lower average selling prices from ongoing price erosion and a changing mix of products 
sales were particularly strong in the wireless cellular markets  led by application specific wireless communications products  amplifiers and power management products  which all grew more than percent over sales for fiscal sales in fiscal for the information appliance segment  excluding the cyrix pc microprocessor unit  grew by percent over sales for fiscal due to higher volume  offset partially by lower average selling prices 
selling prices were impacted by strong competition and efforts to gain market share  as the group focused on information appliance partners in the set top box  webpad and thin client markets 
this represents a shift from fiscal  when pc related markets were the primary focus for information appliances 
network product sales declined in fiscal by percent from sales for fiscal although the company introduced new products employing new digital signal processing technology in the second half of the fiscal year  minimal shipments of these new products and decreasing demand for mature ethernet products contributed to the sales decline 
the decrease in unit shipments more than offset marginal increases in average selling prices for network products 
fiscal sales increased in all geographic regions compared to sales in fiscal  which included cyrix pc microprocessor product sales 
the increases were percent for japan  percent for europe  percent for the asia pacific region and percent for the americas 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation had minimal impact on sales since the favorable effect from the japanese yen was offset by the unfavorable effect experienced as the dollar strengthened against most european currencies 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent and percent for europe and japan  respectively  while it declined to percent for the americas and percent for the asia pacific region 
the overall decline in sales for fiscal from sales for fiscal was primarily caused by price erosion that affected average selling prices in most of the company s product areas 
sales in fiscal for analog products declined by percent from fiscal sales 
general weakness experienced by the company in the pc and communications related markets contributed to the decline in sales for the company s analog products  particularly sales in the first half of the year 
industry wide excess capacity forced average analog selling prices to decline over the year  which more than offset increased unit shipments 
despite the overall decline in sales for analog products  sales within analog for application specific wireless communications products grew by percent over fiscal sales 
this growth was driven by higher unit volume with some modest price declines 
sales for network products in fiscal declined percent from fiscal sales  as the company continued to experience declining shipments in its existing mature portfolio of ethernet products 
the company s failure to introduce successful new network products since the second half of fiscal was the primary cause of the sharp drop in fiscal sales for network products 
cyrix pc microprocessor sales also declined by percent from fiscal sales 
significant price reductions in the cyrix pc microprocessor products caused the decline in cyrix sales  despite a unit volume increase 
highly competitive pricing trends and higher speed microprocessor offerings by competitors negatively impacted average selling prices of cyrix microprocessors 
the decline in sales for information appliance products was also driven by the general weakness experienced during the year in the pc and communications related markets 
sales of integrated microprocessors and certain other pc related peripheral products declined percent in fiscal from fiscal as a result of a decrease in both units and prices 
although integrated microprocessors are now targeted at a variety of information appliance applications  historically  the vast majority of sales of integrated microprocessors through the end of fiscal has been achieved through pc products  such as sub  desktop pcs and lower cost notebook pcs 
compared to sales in fiscal  fiscal sales decreased in all geographic regions 
the decreases were percent for the americas  percent for japan  percent for europe and percent for the asia pacific region 
as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen  the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable effect on sales in japan 
this was offset by a generally favorable effect experienced in europe 
as a result  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation had minimal effect on the overall decrease in sales 
for fiscal  sales as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region and declined to percent for the americas  while it remained constant at percent for europe and percent for japan 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal excluding the effect of charges in fiscal related to the ibm contract termination of million and the write down of cyrix microprocessor inventory of million related to the exit of the cyrix pc microprocessor business  gross margin for fiscal was percent 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal was driven primarily by improved product mix  as cyrix pc microprocessor sales were replaced by higher margin analog product sales  and by increased factory utilization  particularly at the arlington and greenock manufacturing facilities 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal was percent compared to percent for fiscal this reflects lower activity in maine  particularly during the first half of the fiscal year due to the decision to exit the cyrix pc microprocessor business 
excluding the effect of maine  wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal was percent 
as production activity in maine began to ramp back up in the second half of fiscal  factory utilization reached percent by the end of the fiscal year 
the reduction in depreciation expense associated with the impairment losses recorded in may on capital assets in maine also contributed to the overall improvement in gross margin 
for fiscal  the primary factors contributing to the decline in gross margin from fiscal were lower factory utilization combined with price erosion  particularly in the cyrix pc microprocessor products 
lower wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal of percent compared to percent for fiscal  was primarily caused by running manufacturing facilities except those located in maine at reduced capacity utilization rates during most of the year in order to manage inventory levels and control costs 
capacity utilization in maine reached percent in the third quarter of fiscal  as the ibm action enabled the company to ramp up its own microprocessor manufacturing and more fully utilize the capacity available in its maine wafer fabrication facility 
however  capacity utilization in maine significantly declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal  falling to percent by the end of the fiscal year  as a result of the decision to exit the cyrix pc microprocessor business 
additional expenses of approximately million associated with consolidating the greenock capacity and transferring related processes to the company s other manufacturing facilities also unfavorably affected gross margin 
research and development research and development expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
the fiscal and amounts exclude million and million  respectively  for in process r d charges related to acquisitions 
the in process r d charges are included as a component of special items in the consolidated statements of operations 
exiting from the cyrix pc microprocessor business allowed the company to reduce fiscal r d spending for product development  as well as the underlying advanced cmos process development spending 
the company continues to invest resources to develop new cores and integrate those cores with its other technological capabilities to create system on a chip products aimed at the emerging information appliance market 
it also continues to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the wireless communications  personal systems and consumer markets  as well as in the process technologies needed to support those products 
for fiscal  the company devoted approximately percent of its r d effort towards new product development and percent towards the development of process technology 
this represents a decrease from fiscal of percent and percent in spending for new product development and process technology  respectively 
the decline in r d expenses in fiscal from fiscal resulted from the company s ability to manage expenses to more closely align spending with business conditions at the time 
a significant portion of r d expenses had been directed towards developing cyrix microprocessor based products and advanced sub micron processes necessary for manufacturing high performance pc microprocessors 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
the reduction in fiscal expenses reflects the benefits achieved from the cost reduction actions announced in may these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in fiscal of payroll and employee benefit expenses 
the comparable fiscal expenses also included recoveries derived from service fees paid by fairchild semiconductor under a transition services agreement entered into when the company completed its disposition of fairchild 
there is no such recovery reflected in expenses for fiscal  since that agreement terminated during fiscal the decrease in fiscal expenses from fiscal reflects the effect of certain actions taken by the company in late fiscal to reduce its overall cost structure in response to weakened business conditions experienced at that time 
restructuring of operations during fiscal  the company recorded credits of million related to the reduction of certain restructure reserves that were no longer required and the final disposition of equipment from the closure of the santa clara wafer fabrication facility 
other activity during fiscal related to the restructuring actions that were undertaken during fiscal and is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of algorex inc in fiscal  million of the total purchase price was allocated to the value of in process r d 
in connection with the acquisitions during fiscal of comcore semiconductor  inc  future integrated systems  inc 
and the digital audio technology business of gulbransen  inc  million  million and million  respectively  of each total purchase price was allocated to the value of in process r d 
these amounts were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative uses existed for the technologies 
algorex was a provider of high performance digital signal processing products  architecture and software technologies for the wireless communication markets 
national expects these technologies to enhance its capability in the future to provide complete chipset solutions for the cellular phone and wireless information appliance markets 
comcore was a designer of integrated circuits for computer networking and broadband communications that used mathematical techniques combined with advanced digital signal processing and customized design methodologies to create high performance communications integrated circuits 
comcore was acquired in order to add advanced design and technology capabilities to the company s existing analog  mixed signal and digital expertise 
fis supplied graphics hardware and software products for the pc market 
fis was acquired for its design expertise to enhance the company s ability to integrate advanced graphics capabilities into system on a chip solutions for the personal computer market 
the gulbransen audio compressor technology was acquired to provide digital audio building blocks for system on a chip solutions 
in each acquisition  the fair value of the in process r d was based on discounted projected net cash flows expected to be derived after successful completion of the r d projects underway 
estimates of future cash flows from revenues were based primarily on market growth assumptions  lives of underlying technologies and the company s expected share of market 
gross profit projections were based on the company s experience with products that were similar in nature or products sold into markets with similar characteristics 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges were deducted from gross profit to determine net operating income for the in process r d projects 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included sales and marketing expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it has achieved technological feasibility 
the company discounted the net cash flows of the in process r d projects using probability adjusted discount rates that approximated the overall rate of return for each acquisition as a whole and reflected the inherent uncertainties surrounding the development of in process r d projects 
interest income and interest expense for fiscal  the company earned net interest income of million  compared to net interest expense of million for fiscal and net interest income of for fiscal net interest income in fiscal was the result of both higher cash balances and higher interest rates  combined with a decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the redemption of the million percent convertible subordinated notes  which were repaid in november net interest expense in fiscal compared to net interest income in fiscal was primarily attributable to less interest earned from slightly lower rates on lower average cash balances while interest expense was relatively consistent  as average debt balances remained unchanged 
in addition  the company capitalized million of interest associated with capital expansion projects in fiscal compared to million in fiscal there was no interest capitalized in fiscal other income  net other income  net was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal for fiscal  this included a net gain of million from equity investments  million of net intellectual property income and other miscellaneous income of million 
net intellectual property income for fiscal related primarily to two significant licensing agreements 
this compares to fiscal  which included million of net intellectual property income related primarily to a single significant licensing agreement and a million net loss from equity investments 
these amounts were offset by a million settlement of disputes involving intellectual property rights and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
for fiscal  other income  net included million of net intellectual property income related to a single significant licensing agreement  as well as smaller ongoing royalty receipts  a million net gain from equity investments and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to income tax benefits in fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to effective tax rates of approximately percent and percent for fiscal and  respectively 
the tax rate in fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the reduction in us taxable income from the utilization of net operating loss carryovers 
realization of net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on the company s ability to generate future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted us taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these tax assets 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectations of future us taxable income 
foreign operations the company s foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes the company to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
where practical  net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions are hedged using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
the company s exposure from foreign revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
the company hedges up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
financial market risks the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  the company uses derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of the company s investment portfolio  the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
an increase in interest rates would benefit the company due to the large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates also would not increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of the company s debt obligations 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company enters into these transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s balances as of may  financial condition as of may   cash and short term investments increased to a total million from a total million at may  cash generated from operating activities was million  an increase over million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income primarily contributed to this increase 
although operating cash was positively affected by net income earned in fiscal  it was negatively impacted by changes in working capital 
the negative effect from changes in working capital was attributable to increases primarily in receivables and in inventories due to higher sales and increased demand 
investing activities generated cash of million in fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal and million in fiscal proceeds of million from the sale of fairchild stock was the primary source of cash from investing activities 
proceeds of million from the sale of the cyrix pc microprocessor business also contributed to cash from investing activities 
these proceeds were partially offset by the company s investment in property  plant and equipment of million 
this compares to cash used in investing activities in fiscal and fiscal  which was primarily for capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
lower capital expenditures in fiscal from fiscal were driven by significantly reduced spending for the maine wafer fabrication facility  which was essentially completed by the end of calendar  and management s effort to control the overall level of capital expenditures in response to then weakened business conditions 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to providing cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal a total of million was used to repay debt in fiscal this included payment of million to redeem the company s percent convertible subordinated notes 
debt repayment was partially offset by the receipt of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
in fiscal  the primary contributors to cash generated by financing activities included the proceeds of a million drawdown on new equipment loans and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
those amounts were partially offset by million of general debt repayment 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities included proceeds of a million drawdown on new and existing equipment loans and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
those amounts were offset by the million redemption of substantially all of the cyrix percent convertible subordinated notes and million of other general debt repayment 
management foresees substantial cash outlays for plant and equipment throughout fiscal  with primary focus on capacity expansion in its wafer manufacturing and assembly and test facilities  based on expected future unit volume increases 
as a result  the fiscal capital expenditure level is expected to be significantly higher than the fiscal level 
existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  are expected to be sufficient to finance planned fiscal capital investments 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board deferred the effective date for adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company is presently analyzing this statement and has not yet determined its impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to adopt this statement by the first quarter of fiscal in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the staff accounting bulletin summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the staff accounting bulletin is effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have any material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of opinion for the definition of an employee for purposes of applying opinion  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
the interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the company believes that this interpretation will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
year readiness program the company completed its transition from calendar year to with no reported significant impact to operations 
the company terminated its formal year program after its systems  facilities and products successfully transitioned the february leap year date 
year project costs and resource consumption incurred through fiscal totaled approximately million 
approximately percent of those costs were related to internal staff costs  with the remaining percent for hardware and software upgrade costs that were incremental to ongoing operating expenses 
internal staff that were dedicated to the year project  either full time or part time  have been redeployed to other areas of focus  such as e commerce 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook section and within certain sections of management s discussion and analysis are forward looking based on current expectations and management s estimates 
actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these forward looking statements 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
in addition  substantial capital and r d investment are required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of these industry conditions  the company has experienced in the past and may experience in the future periodic fluctuations in its operating results 
the company s strategy is to put systems on a chip for its key trendsetting data highway partners  using its analog expertise as a starting point for forward integration 
as a result of this focus  the company expects to grow at or above market rates of growth in particular segments of the analog  mixed signal and information appliance markets 
market conditions for the semiconductor industry improved throughout the fiscal year 
the company experienced better than expected sequential quarterly sales growth as new orders continued to strengthen 
the analog business was especially healthy  particularly in the cellular markets where sales of amplifier  power management and application specific wireless products were strong 
the company believes its business in these areas will continue to grow and anticipates this improvement to continue into fiscal however  the company faces the risk that the current improvement in the semiconductor industry may be short lived 
unless there is continued improvement in new orders  the company may be unable to attain the level of revenue growth expected for fiscal and operating results will be unfavorably affected 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from products for the wireless handset market 
a decline in the rate of growth for this specific market may also have an unfavorable impact on the company s future revenue and results of operations 
the overall rate of orders and product pricing may also be affected by continued and increasing competition and by market growth rates in the personal computer  communication and networking areas 
the company also continues to devote efforts to develop new network products in order to regain its market position 
although new products employing new digital signal processing technology were introduced in the second half of fiscal  there have been minimal shipments of these products to date 
the company anticipates that these new products will begin generating sales in the first half of fiscal lack of customer acceptance of products and unforeseen obstacles or schedule delays with additional product development may affect the company s sales and results of operations 
while business conditions and overall market pricing have a major influence on gross margin  the company s planned expansion of manufacturing capacity  improvements in manufacturing efficiency and the introduction of new products are expected to result in future gross margin improvement 
future gross margin improvement is also predicated on increased new order rates of higher margin multi market analog products 
future gross margin is also affected by wafer fabrication capacity utilization 
although management expects to more fully utilize its existing wafer capacity  this expectation is based on continued improvement in new orders  as well as increasing sales volumes 
future gross margin will also be affected by the successful completion of the closure of the inch wafer fabrication facility in greenock  scotland and transfer of that manufacturing into the inch wafer fabrication facility on the same site  as well as to other national facilities 
the company currently expects wafer manufacturing activity in the inch wafer fabrication facility to cease by the end of september and all other actions associated with the closure to be completed shortly thereafter 
until the closure is completed  the company may be unable to benefit fully from the impact of the related manufacturing cost reductions 
future gross margin will also be affected by the company s ability to fill the available capacity in its inch wafer fabrication facility in maine  where wafer starts were significantly reduced due to the company s decision in may to exit the cyrix pc microprocessor business 
although the company had been seeking a third party to partner with national in owning and operating the maine facility  it is no longer pursuing such an arrangement 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company entered into a licensing agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company to gain access to a variety of its advanced sub micron processes for use in the maine facility  if and when those processes are fully developed 
national is currently utilizing its own process technology in maine and this arrangement will enable national to ultimately gain access down to tsmc s micron process technology 
these advanced process technologies are expected to accelerate the development of high performance digital and mixed signal products for the information appliance  wireless and networking markets 
there can be no assurance that tsmc will successfully develop all of the processes provided for in the agreement 
lack of adequate process technology would have an adverse impact on the long term capability of the maine facility 
the company is currently pursuing a number of actions to increase the capacity utilization in the maine wafer fabrication facility 
the increase is expected to come from both internal need as well as third party foundry opportunities 
although revenue from third party foundry arrangements was not significant during fiscal  the company expects total revenue from this source to grow in fiscal total foundry revenue achieved will depend upon the amount of unutilized capacity available and the level of external demand for foundry production 
there can be no assurance that external demand for foundry production would not be adversely affected by other outside foundry operations including tsmc in the event they experience available capacity 
the company expects to use this foundry business to balance the level of manufacturing activity in maine  while also considering the service needs of its foundry customers 
management believes that it will be able to successfully increase the manufacturing level in maine 
however  under utilization of capacity in maine will have an unfavorable impact on future gross margin 
the company s focus is to continue to introduce new products  particularly more highly integrated system on a chip products and higher margin analog products that are targeted towards wireless communication and information appliances 
so far  the market for information appliances has grown slower than expected 
despite the fact that the company s information appliance products have received acceptance for design into numerous customer product development projects  volume demand for these products has not yet materialized to contribute any significant level of revenue 
if the development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future gross margin may be unfavorably affected 
the company believes that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development and market acceptance of new products  is a key factor to the company s successful growth and its ability to achieve strong financial performance 
national s product portfolio  particularly products in the personal systems and communications area  have short product life cycles 
successful development and introduction of new products are critical to the company s ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
the company will continue to invest resources to develop new cores and integrate those cores with its other technological capabilities to create system on a chip products aimed at the emerging information appliance market 
it will also continue to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the communications  personal systems and consumer markets  as well as in process technologies needed to support those products 
as a result  the company anticipates r d spending for fiscal to be higher than the fiscal level  but lower as a percentage of sales  at approximately percent 
the company also expects overall sg a expenses to be slightly higher than in fiscal  but to decline to approximately percent of sales as the company continues to manage its cost structure and control spending 
certain aspects of the company s logistics operation are outsourced to a third party provider 
during the first quarter of  the company plans to transfer those outsourced operations to another third party provider 
in the event that the company experiences difficulties or encounters unforeseen obstacles during the transition or the third party is unable to provide an acceptable level of services  this change may have an unfavorable impact on the company s future revenue and results of operations 
because of significant international sales  the company benefits overall from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
as such  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect the company s consolidated sales and net income 
the company attempts to manage the short term exposures to foreign currency fluctuations  but there can be no assurance that the company s risk management activities will fully offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  the company has received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that these governments or other government entities will not serve future notices of assessments on the company  or that the amounts of such assessments and the failure of the company to favorably resolve such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company s tax returns for certain years are under examination in the us while the company believes it has sufficiently provided for all tax obligations  there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of the tax examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
the forward looking statements discussed or incorporated by reference in this outlook section involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the general economy  regulatory and international economic conditions  the changing environment of the semiconductor industry  competitive products and pricing  growth in the pc and communications industries  the effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  and such other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the company s reports and filings with the sec
