new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging activities and supercedes several existing standards 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december as amended in march the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition the sab 
to the extent the guidance in the sab differs from generally accepted accounting principles previously utilized by an sec registrant  the sab indicates that the sec staff will not object to reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
prior to promulgation of the sab  the company had reported some non refundable  up front and milestone fees received pursuant to distribution agreements in the period earned  which was deemed to be the date when all related material commitments had been satisfied and no future consideration was required 
while the company believes the related supply arrangements entered into with its distributors provides for arms length pricing of product sales  the sab requires that the distribution agreement fees now be linked to the supply arrangements and reported as additional revenue from product sales made pursuant to those arrangements 
as a result  up front distribution agreement fees are initially deferred and subsequently amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual period of the supply arrangements 
the company is currently assessing the full impact that the sab will have on its financial statements 
once the final assessment is complete  the total financial impact of the sab will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the company currently anticipates that the cumulative effect as of january  of the change in accounting principle if measured at january  would be approximately million 
such amount had previously been reported as other revenue and represents the amount of deferred revenue that would have remained unamortized as of january  with respect to payments previously received and for which the company expects to record future other revenue under the related supply agreements 
the unamortized deferred revenue is determined as if the above noted accounting principle required by the sab had always been in place
