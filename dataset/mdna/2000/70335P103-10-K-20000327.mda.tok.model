allowance for credit losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in its loan and lease portfolio and the general economy 
management makes a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings necessary to maintain an allowance for credit losses that is adequate to cover estimated losses with respect to loans and leases receivable which are deemed probable and estimable based on information currently known to management 
the amount charged to earnings is based upon several factors  including a continuing review of delinquent  classified and non accrual loans and leases  large loans and leases  and overall portfolio quality  regular examination and review of the loan portfolio by regulatory authorities  analytical review of loan and lease charge off experience  delinquency rates  other relevant historical and peer statistical ratios  and management s judgment with respect to local and general economic conditions and their impact on the existing loan and lease portfolio 
although management believes the allowance is adequate to protect against future losses arising out of its existing loan and lease portfolio  actual losses are dependent on future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance may be necessary 
patriot will continue to monitor and modify its allowance for credit losses as conditions dictate 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review patriot s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for estimated credit losses based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
during patriot s loan and lease portfolio grew from  at december   to  almost all of this growth was in patriot s commercial loan and lease portfolio 
management deemed it appropriate to add  to patriot s allowance to adequately address the risk inherent in patriot s portfolio 
included in patriot s loan growth was the loan portfolio acquired in the first lehigh acquisition and its related credit reserves of  management deemed this acquired reserve to be adequate and consistent with its reserving methodology and philosophy

deposits are generally attracted from within patriot s primary market area through the offering of various deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans 
patriot also solicits jumbo deposits from various sources 
total deposits at december  were  compared to  at december  of that increase   was the result of the first lehigh acquisition and  came from aggressive marketing of money market and other transaction based deposit accounts 
the remaining  of that increase came from patriot s jumbo deposit program

patriot utilizes borrowings as a source of funds for its growth strategy and its asset liability management 
patriot is eligible to obtain advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb upon the security of the fhlb common stock it owns and certain of its residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities  provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
fhlb advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the maximum amount that the fhlb will advance to member institutions fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb 
patriot also uses repurchase agreements as a funding source 
repurchase agreements are generally short term obligations collateralized by government agency and other securities

liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
patriot s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on investment and mortgage backed securities  fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit inflows and loan and mortgage backed security prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  general interest rates and competition 
therefore  patriot manages its balance sheet to provide adequate liquidity based upon various economic  interest rate and competitive assumptions and in light of profitability measures 
during  significant liquidity was provided by financing activities  particularly short term fhlb advances and deposits 
maturities of investment and mortgage backed securities also provided significant liquidity during the funds provided by these activities were invested in new loans and used to fund the repurchase of patriot common stock 
at december   patriot had outstanding loan commitments of  patriot anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its loan commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled  based upon historical experience  patriot expects that substantially all of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained at maturity 
capital resources 
fdic regulations currently require companies to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of not less than of tier capital to total adjusted assets  a tier capital ratio of not less than of risk adjusted assets  and a minimum risk based total capital ratio based upon credit risk of not less than 
the fdic requires a minimum leverage capital requirement of for institutions rated composite under the camel rating system

   patriot bank    management of interest rate risk 
the principal objective of patriot s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain on and off balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given patriot s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  patriot seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
patriot monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
patriot s board of directors has established an asset liability committee comprised of senior management  which is responsible for reviewing its asset liability and interest rate position and making decisions involving asset liability considerations 
the asset liability committee meets regularly and reports trends and patriot s interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap theoretically would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap position would theoretically tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
patriot pursues several actions designed to control its level of interest rate risk 
these actions include increasing the percentage of the loan portfolio consisting of short term and adjustable rate loans through increased originations of these loans  acquiring short term and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  and undertaking to lengthen the maturities of deposits and borrowings 
at december   patriot s total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total net interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same time period by  representing a one year cumulative gap  as defined above  as a percentage of total assets of negative 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be repaid and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans

includes assets available for sale and held to maturity 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans and is reduced for the allowance for estimated loan losses  and unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities 
annual prepayment rates for loans and mortgage backed securities range from to 
money market savings accounts  passbook accounts and now accounts are assumed to have decay rates between and annually 
in addition to gap analysis  patriot utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling patriot has calculated an estimate of net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments in existence at december  patriot has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon immediate and sustained changes in interest rates rate shocks 
rate shocks assume that all interest rates increase or decrease on the first day of the period modeled and remain at that level for the entire period 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the year ending december rate shock to interest rates change patriot s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating patriot s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of patriot s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
year issues year issues result from the inability of many computer programs or computerized equipment to accurately calculate  store or use data for the year or later 
these potential shortcomings could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  track important customer information  provide convenient access to this information  or engage in normal business operations 
while lingering concern exists about certain dates during the year  the most significant date  january   has passed without incident 
as of the date of this filing patriot has not experienced any significant year problems relating to its internal or third party computer systems 
nor has patriot experienced any issues regarding ability of commercial customers to meet debt service as a result of year issues 
patriot incurred costs related to year compliance and testing amounting to  and will continue to monitor systems for problems in the future  however the costs related to that process are not expected to be significant
