the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report  including the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains certain statements  trend analysis and other information that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended  which may involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements including the words anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend and other similar expressions 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
company background the company was founded in to design and develop engineering ic validation systems to test and measure complex electronic devices at the prototype stage 
the company was acquired by valid logic in and then by cadence in as a result of the merger of valid logic into cadence 
cadence operated the company as a separate subsidiary 
in july  the company successfully completed an initial public offering of common stock  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
in february  the company completed a secondary public offering of its common stock  including  shares issued by the company  and  shares sold by cadence  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
as of december   cadence continues to own approximately of the company s common stock 
results of operations net sales net sales is comprised of engineering ic validation systems sales  software sales including ic validation systems software and virtual test software and service sales  which consists primarily of revenue derived from maintenance and consulting contracts 
net sales rose sharply in after two consecutive years of sales declines 
in general  two factors contributed to the increase the product line is broader than it was two years ago 
towards the end of  the company released the mhz vanguard logic ic validation system  electra and electra mx mixed signal ic validation systems  all of which contributed to the increase in net sales 
additionally  in mid  the company began customer shipments of the orion memory ic validation system 
systems and software sales for the last three years are as follows year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease systems vanguard   n a other logic    mixed signal    memory  n a n a total systems    software systems    virtual test    total software    capital spending within the semiconductor industry increased in for the first time in several years 
although our revenues do not necessarily correlate directly with industry capital spending  the increase in expenditures indicates a healthier selling environment for our products 
semiconductor capital spending over the past three years is as follows year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease semiconductor capital spending per vlsi research  dec 
   systems sales systems sales in increased million or over  after decreasing million or in from sales of the mhz vanguard logic ic validation system  almost entirely to the company s largest customer  accounted for of net system sales in  up from in the vanguard is the company s flagship product and eventually will be the platform for our mixed signal and system on chip soc solutions in addition to the current logic solutions 
sales of other logic systems declined by million or from as a result of the vanguard ramp  but still accounted for of net system sales 
the company expects these products to continue to contribute to revenues over the next several years 
mixed signal systems sales increased million or over  with most of the volume occurring in the latter part of nearly all mixed signal sales in were for the electra family  while all mixed signal sales in were for older generation products 
the company began shipping orion memory ic validation systems in the second quarter of there were no revenues from memory systems in system sales in declined million or from this decline resulted in part from the generally depressed state of the semiconductor industry  and in part because of a strategy shift made by the company s largest customer 
that customer was in the process of segmenting its markets over and and  as a result  spent substantially less money on the company s systems as it developed and implemented its segmentation strategy 
a number of the design starts resulting from this strategy shift are now getting to the prototype validation stage  driving the current demand for vanguard systems 
software sales system software sales increased or in from the increase is directly attributable to the increase in system sales  and particularly vanguard system sales  which carry a higher dollar volume of software revenue 
virtual test software revenues increased by or in from  as increased sales of standardized virtual test software licenses more than offset reduced sales of custom software 
the company no longer pursues non standard custom software sales  and now focuses on developing standard products that can be sold multiple times to multiple customers 
system software sales in increased or from largely due to the introduction of the vanguard ic validation system in late virtual test software sales increased by or in compared to  as the company began shifting from non standard custom software sales to standard software product sales as discussed above 
service sales service revenues declined in by or from in  service revenues decreased million or from the principle reason for these declines was the company s decision to exit the consulting business for virtual test and focus on sales of standard virtual test software products 
international sales amounted to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to and of net sales for and  respectively 
the decrease in international sales since has been due primarily to much lower sales to customers in the asia pacific region  partially offset by moderate improvement in net sales in europe 
sales to one customer amounted to  and of net sales in   and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in  or gross margin for the year ended december  gross margin was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales  excluding non recurring charges  for  and million or of net sales for during  slower growth for higher margin software sales relative to growth in systems sales  increased provisions for warranty costs due to an increase in standard warranty terms from days to one year  and to two years for the company s largest customer  and sales of certain lower margin older generation systems resulted in gross margins below the prior years levels  excluding non recurring charges 
overall gross margin percent in is expected to remain at similar levels to those realized in the gross margin from sales of the company s ic validation systems was for  compared to for  excluding non recurring charges  and for software gross margin of for was slightly higher than the gross margin of 
software gross margin in and declined from in due primarily to the impact of costs of customization of certain software products sold during the first half of  and increased amortization of capitalized software development costs 
sales of services yielded gross margin of for  down from in and in service gross margin declined from through due primarily to a decrease in higher margin virtual test consulting contracts during these periods 
in september   the company acquired all of the assets of performic for a cash price of million 
performic  located in dresden  germany  is a developer of technologies aimed at addressing the engineering test needs of memory manufacturers 
in connection with this acquisition  a charge of million was recorded in systems cost of sales for inventories rendered obsolete by the performic acquisition 
with this acquisition  the company opened its new european design center in dresden 
operating expenses for the year ended december   research  development and engineering r d expenses increased by million or to million from million for the same period in r d expenses were million in the increase in was due primarily to the company s investment in the development of the orion memory ic validation system products  combined with lower capitalization of software development costs 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were for the year ended december  and and for and  respectively 
the decrease in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales in was attributable to the increase in net sales discussed above 
capitalized software development costs and amortization were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   compared with million and  respectively  in  and million and  respectively  in amortization of capitalized software development costs increased in because capitalized amounts related to the vanguard ic validation system and certain virtual test products began amortizing when the products were released to customers beginning in late for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million or to million from million in in  sg a expenses increased or million from million in the increase in operating expenses in primarily reflects payment of sales commissions on higher sales volumes  and payment of employee performance bonuses attributable to company achievement of specified operating income targets 
the increase in sg a expenses in over was principally the result of increased investment in the company s direct distribution channels  most notably in europe and japan  as well as increased distributor commissions for sales in regions not served by the company s direct sales organization 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in and in the decrease in sg a expenses as a percent of net sales resulted directly from the increase in net sales discussed above 
during the second half of  the company implemented a restructuring plan  including a reduction in the company s worldwide employee headcount by approximately  the termination of certain international distributor agreements  and the establishment of direct sales operations in europe and asia 
the primary objectives of the restructuring plan were to strengthen the company s international distribution channel  and to maintain acceptable operating expense levels as the company moved forward 
the total non recurring acquisition and restructuring charges recorded in operating expenses amounted to million 
these charges included acquired in process research development of associated with the acquisition of performic  associated with the termination of certain international distributors  and for severance costs 
other income  net other income  net was for  for and for the increase in other income  net for from was due primarily to foreign exchange transaction gains 
the decrease in other income  net from to was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances on interest income 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  the company s benefit from income taxes for reflects recognition of a portion of the benefit from net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company had recorded deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards of million  against which it recorded a valuation allowance of million 
as the company returned to profitability during  this valuation allowance was reduced appropriately by approximately million 
of this reduction in the valuation allowance  approximately million was credited directly to shareholders equity in recognition of the tax benefits from deduction of employee gains on stock option exercises for tax return purposes 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the company s income tax position includes the effects of available tax benefits in certain countries where the company does business  benefits for available net operating loss carryforwards  and tax expense for subsidiaries with pre tax income 
while management anticipates the company s effective tax rate to remain at levels similar to  this rate is very sensitive to the geographic and product mix of the company s net sales  and therefore could be higher or lower in the future depending upon actual net sales realized 
net income as a result of the various factors discussed above  net income for the year ended december  increased to million or per diluted share compared to a loss of million or per share for the corresponding period in net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share 
future operating results results of operations for the periods discussed above should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period  and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
like most high technology and high growth companies  the company faces certain business risks that could have adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the following sales of the company s products to a limited number of major customers are expected to continue to account for a high percentage of net sales over the foreseeable future 
any sudden reduction or loss of orders from any major customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is dependent on high dollar customer orders  deriving a substantial portion of its net sales from the sale of engineering ic validation systems which typically range in price from million to over million per unit 
a substantial amount of the company s net sales are typically realized in the last few days of each quarter 
during  the company s quarterly net sales were negatively impacted by customer decisions to delay or cancel plans to place orders for the company s products in the last few days of the quarter 
the timing and sales price of a single order can have a significant impact on the company s net sales and results of operations for a particular period 
the company s net sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted if an order is received too late in a given period to permit product shipment during that period 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed and planned expenditures are based  in part  on anticipated orders 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research  development and engineering makes it difficult to reduce expenses in a particular quarter if the company s sales goals for that quarter are not met 
the inability to reduce the company s expenses quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of any revenue shortfall on the company s results of operations 
the company purchases some key components from sole or single source vendors  for which alternative sources are not readily available 
a few of these suppliers are small independent companies and could expose the company to increased risk of temporary shortages for certain key components 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are also subject to influences driven by rapid technological changes  a highly competitive industry  a lengthy sales cycle  and the cyclical nature of general economic conditions 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company and by its competitors  industry acceptance of virtual test software  the level and timing of available shippable orders and backlog  the duration and severity of the economic downturn in asia  and the business risks discussed above 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that such growth will be sustained in future periods or that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
year during and  the company developed and executed its year readiness plan which included steps to monitor  test and implement corrective measures for the company s critical vendors and suppliers  products and information systems 
the company estimates the costs incurred during and  including payments to third parties and estimates of internal costs  for developing and implementing its year readiness plan were less than and  respectively 
to date  the company has not been impacted by any material year issues 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  and funds available under an existing bank line of credit of million 
since  the company has relied on cash generated from operations and cash raised through public stock offerings as its principal source of liquidity 
operating activities the company s net cash flows from operating activities includes cash received from customers  payments to suppliers  payments to employees and interest received and paid 
during and  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  net cash used in operating activities amounted to million 
for  the company realized a significant improvement in cash flow from operating activities  driven by the increase in net sales discussed above  combined with improvement in the days sales outstanding in trade receivables  and reductions in inventory levels 
during  a significant decline in revenues during a year where the company continued to invest heavily in both its research and development efforts and in its distribution capabilities led to a decline in cash flow from operating activities 
other factors which negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities during were increases in trade receivables and inventories 
the company s trade receivables  inventories and accounts payable have fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of shipments  cash collections and inventory receipts near period end 
the size and timing of a single customer shipment or collection can have a significant impact on trade receivables and inventories 
trade receivables amounted to million at december  and december  because a more significant portion of the company s quarterly net sales were realized earlier in each quarter during than the company had experienced in  days sales outstanding declined from days at december  to days at december  inventories decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the combination of increased sales volume and focused inventory reduction programs 
investing activities capital equipment expenditures of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  were primarily for computers  software  demo equipment  engineering equipment and service spare parts used in the company s operations 
the higher level of capital spending during was largely driven by investments in production equipment and tooling necessary to begin shipments of the company s vanguard ic validation systems late in following these significant investments  there was less need for additional capital expenditures during in addition  the company capitalized certain costs associated with software development of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the higher amount in reflects the investment in software technology associated with the company s new vanguard ic validation systems which were introduced in late financing activities in and  net cash provided by financing activities was and million  respectively 
in  net cash used in financing activities was in may  the company initiated a plan to repurchase up to  shares of its currently outstanding common stock over twelve months in open market and negotiated transactions 
this repurchase program authorized the repurchase of shares in increments in accordance with sec regulations and board of directors guidance 
during  this program resulted in the repurchase of  shares at a total cost of million 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during cash used for payments of certain capital leases obtained by the company for computers and equipment used in operations was  and during  and  respectively 
the company received million   and million in  and  respectively  from the issuance of stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash provided by financing activities during was attributable to proceeds of million from the company s secondary public offering of common stock 
during and  the company realized reductions in current income tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  resulting from the benefit of tax deductions of employee gains upon exercise of cadence stock options  and to a lesser extent from the exercise of the company s employee stock options 
during  no such benefits were recorded as a result of the company s pre tax loss before deduction of such benefits 
had the company generated sufficient pre tax income during  the tax benefits which would have been realized as a result of deduction of employee stock option gains would have amounted to approximately million 
for  these deductions increased the company s net operating loss carryforward for tax return purposes 
during  the company generated sufficient pre tax income to realize the benefit of the carryforward deduction of these option exercises 
this benefit is included above in the realized reduction in income tax liabilities for the compensation for tax purposes associated with stock option exercises and with disqualifying dispositions are typically not treated as expenses of the company for financial reporting purposes  and the exercise of cadence stock options does not increase the number of shares of company common stock outstanding 
the tax benefits available from the stock option deduction may decrease in the future as employee holdings of cadence stock options decline due to option exercises and cancellations 
the timing and magnitude of such decrease in tax benefits  if realized  is uncertain as the number of employee stock options which are exercised  and the amount of gains realized upon exercise  will be determined by  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of cadence common stock 
at the end of  the company secured a million revolving line of credit with us national bank of oregon  which is available for general corporate purposes as needed 
under the agreement  the company can borrow  with interest at the bank s prime lending rate  or if lower  at certain margins above banker s acceptance or interbank offering rates 
there have been no borrowings against the line of credit to date 
the term of the current credit line agreement ends april  management intends to renew the agreement at that time 
the company believes that existing funds  funds expected to be generated by operating activities  and the available line of credit  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and other general corporate purposes through at least the next twelve months 
the company currently has no significant capital commitments other than commitments under facility operating leases and vendor contracts for development services  consulting services and parts 
from time to time  the company may consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company presently has no significant understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
any such transactions  if consummated  may require additional financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if the interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or the results of its operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the euro is the functional currency of the company s subsidiaries in france  germany and switzerland 
the yen is the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in japan 
the company does maintain cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in order to meet minimum operating requirements of its foreign subsidiaries 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
derivatives are used to manage well defined foreign currency risks 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of recorded short term receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency 
accordingly  the impact of exchange rates on the forward contracts will be substantially offset by the impact of such changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on the forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged positions denominated in foreign currencies would not be material to the company s financial position or the results of its operations
