item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
certain comparisons between periods have been made on a percentage or weighted average per square foot basis 
the latter technique adjusts for square footage changes at different times during the year 
general overview at december  and  the company operated manufacturers outlet centers  compared to at the end of the company s operating gross leasable area gla at december  was million square feet compared to million square feet and million square feet at december  and  respectively 
from january  to december   the company grew by increasing rents at its operating centers  opening two new centers  acquiring one center and expanding nine centers 
the million square feet sf of net gla added is detailed as follows since january  changes in gla sf in s new centers developed leesburg corner wrentham village total new centers centers expanded wrentham village north georgia leesburg corner camarillo premium outlets woodbury common folsom premium outlets columbia gorge desert hills liberty village other total centers expanded  centers held for sale solvang designer outlets lawrence riverfront center acquired waikele premium outlets net gla added during the period  other data gla at end of period    weighted average gla    centers in operation at end of period new centers opened centers expanded centers sold centers held for sale center acquired note average gla weighted by months in operation the company s centers produced weighted average reported tenant sales of approximately per square foot in and per square foot in and two of the company s centers  woodbury common and desert hills  generated approximately  and of the company s total revenue for the years  and  respectively 
in addition  approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from the company s centers in california  including desert hills 
the company does not consider any single store lease to be material  no individual tenant  combining all of its store concepts  accounts for more than of the company s gross revenues or total gla  and only two tenants occupy more than of the company s total gla

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income  as presented in the statements of operations included elsewhere herein  to facilitate a clearer understanding of the operating results of the company 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity real estate investment trust 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income applicable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or writedowns of property  exclusive of outparcel sales  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash from operations  and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs 
year ended december  income to common shareholders before extraordinary item   add depreciation and amortization   amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets   loss on writedown of assets  minority interest   preferred unit distribution  ffo   average shares units outstanding   dividends declared per share economic conditions substantially all leases contain provisions  including escalations of base rents and percentage rentals calculated on gross sales  to mitigate the impact of inflation 
inflationary increases in common area maintenance and real estate tax expenses are substantially all reimbursed by tenants 
virtually all tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants 
the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms  and by pursuing contracts with creditworthy upscale and national brand name tenants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating rate debt arrangements 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire rate curve would adversely affect the company s annual interest cost by approximately million annually
