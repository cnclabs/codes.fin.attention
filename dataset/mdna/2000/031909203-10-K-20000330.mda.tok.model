which deferred the effective date of the sfas no 
for one year 
the company will adopt sfas no

the company has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

year issue update the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based upon operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures as of december   including a discussion of how those exposures are managed 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk through its normal operating activities 
the company generates fixed rate loans and investments through its origination and asset management activities 
a substantial portion of these fixed rate loans and investments are financed by libor based notes payable and warehouse loans payable 
in the normal course of business  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments help to hedge against changes in interest rates 
the company may reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are used to lower funding costs  to diversify sources of funding  or to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor is the company party to highly leveraged derivatives 
these financial instruments include interest rate cap agreements  put options and forward and futures contracts 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company controls the risk of its hedging agreements  interest rate cap agreements and forward and futures contracts through approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
the company purchases interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the company enters into these agreements to change the fixed variable interest rate mix of the debt portfolio to reduce the company s aggregate risk to movements in interest rates 
accordingly  the company enters into agreements to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce the company s risk of incurring higher interest costs due to rising interest rates 
the cap agreements entitle the company to receive from the counterparties the amounts  if any  by which an interest rate index exceeds agreed upon thresholds 
the potential loss in fair value related to such cap agreements resulting from a adverse change in interest rates is not material 
futures and forward contracts are commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments at a future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery 
the company enters into these contracts to reduce the risk of loss in value on certain investments and loan portfolios due to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
initial margin requirements are met in cash or other instruments 
futures contracts have little credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties 
forward agreements and interest rate swaps and caps are subject to the creditworthiness of the counterparties  which are principally large financial institutions 
interest rate sensitivity analyses are used to measure the company s interest rate risk related to its trading and other than trading portfolios by computing hypothetical changes in fair values of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a hypothetical changes in interest rates 
the following are the company s interest rate sensitivity analyses as of december  dollars in millions retained interests in securitization trading change in hypothetical hypothetical interest rates fair value change change a hypothetical increase in interest rates is projected to decrease loan pre payments increasing the fair value of the retained interests 
this increase is projected to more than offset a decrease in fair value of the retained interests caused by higher market interest rates 
other than trading change in hypothetical hypothetical interest rates fair value change change the other than trading category includes loans held for sale  loans and asset portfolios  asset backed securities  derivative positions  senior subordinated notes and the amount outstanding under the company s credit agreement to the extent the fair value could be affected by a widening of spreads 
in an increasing interest rate environment  the company projects the fair value of its debt obligations to decrease offset  in part  by a fair value reduction in its asset and derivative portfolio 
any market interest rate change would adjust the company s projected cash flows from its variable rate assets and liabilities 
such changes in cash flows are not reflected in the above analysis as the fair values of variable assets and liabilities would not materially be affected by a change in interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates related to certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while changes in interest rates related to other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as variable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
additionally  changes in market interest rates may increase or decrease due to pre payments and defaults influenced by changes in market interest rates affecting the valuation of certain assets 
accordingly  the data presented in the above table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk to the extent its income bearing assets exceeds its related foreign denominated debt 
at december   the company had one forward contract in place to hedge against a portion of its foreign exchange rate exposure 
the following table summarizes the hypothetical impact to the company s financial position due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates dollars in millions change in foreign exchange rates hypothetical hypothetical per dollar fair value change change other market risks as with any entity s investment or asset portfolio  the company is subject to the risk that certain unpredictable conditions can exist which combine to have the effect of limiting the company s ability to liquidate its assets through sale or securitization 
as was the case in late when unprecedented market conditions caused a widening of interest rate spreads resulting in losses to the company and substantial requirements on the company s liquidity position  certain events  however remote a possibility  can again exist reducing the company s ability to liquidate certain assets 
the company believes its liquidity risk would not be materially impacted solely by a change in interest rates without a more substantial change in spreads
