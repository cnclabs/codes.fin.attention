item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
general the company is the second largest casket manufacturer in the united states and produces a wide variety of caskets  casket components and burial vaults 
during  the company acquired colonial guild  ltd 
thus becoming a major manufacturer of commemorative products 
the company s finished caskets are marketed through a network of company and privately owned distributors  which serve domestic funeral homes  as well as certain foreign markets 
burial vaults are sold directly to funeral home and cemetery operators as well as to privately owned distributors 
the company s commemorative memorial products are sold directly to cemetery operators  monument dealers and funeral homes  and its architectural signage products are sold primarily to sign and trophy dealers 
the company owns casket distribution operations serving the new england  southern  northern california  pacific northwest and certain midwest markets 
in the remainder of the domestic markets  the company believes that privately owned casket distributors will continue to be the most effective way to market the company s casket products and expects to continue to strongly support the efforts of these privately owned distributors 
funeral homes are required by federal regulation to provide price lists to their customers  and generally publish such price lists annually 
as a result  the casket manufacturing industry has established the industry wide practice of setting its prices each year 
the memorialization business also establishes prices annually  generally during the first calendar quarter 
in setting these prices  the company considers expected raw material prices  competitive considerations  the general state of the economy and inflationary expectations 
this industry practice requires the company to set its prices in anticipation of  rather than in response to  changes in raw material and other costs 
over the past three years  the company s annual weighted average price increases have ranged from to 
limitations on the timing of price increases relative to changes in costs may cause fluctuations in operating margins  and therefore  make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
the major domestic casket manufacturers have all developed discount and rebate programs  which are commonplace in the casket manufacturing industry  designed to encourage volume purchases by funeral homes 
in the case of the company  these discounts are generally absorbed equally between the company and the distributors

selected quarterly operating results and seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced seasonal variations 
generally  the company s net sales of caskets are highest in the first quarter and lowest in the third quarter of each year 
these fluctuations are due in part to the seasonal variance in the death rate  with a greater number of deaths generally occurring in cold weather months  and the timing of the company s annual manufacturing facility vacation shutdowns  which occur primarily in the third quarter 
the company s memorialization sales seasonally lag the company s casket business  and are highest in the second quarter  coinciding with the memorial day holiday  and lowest in the first quarter 
in addition  casket and memorialization products operating results can vary between quarters of the same or different years due to  among other things  fluctuations in the number of deaths  changes in product mix  and the timing of annual price increases relative to changes in costs 
as a result  the company experiences variability in its operating results on a quarterly basis  which may make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
during the fourth quarter of the company recorded non recurring adjustments which were individually significant but were not significant in the aggregate 
the company revised its estimate of deferred revenue relative to its bronze memorial pre need program 
under this program  memorial products are sold on a pre need basis and the basic memorial is produced and stored until the time of need when it is completed by applying dates and final finishing 
during the fourth quarter the company consolidated certain of its operations and reevaluated its estimated completion costs  which are estimated to be less due to anticipated economies of scale and reduced labor costs 
the company also reassessed the stage of completion of its memorial products and it was determined that the actual extent of completion exceeded original estimates 
based upon the analysis  management reduced the company s deferred revenue estimate by approximately million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of the company performed detailed analyses of inventory balances related to its merchandising system products and metal vault operations  and refined its accounting processes for inventories
