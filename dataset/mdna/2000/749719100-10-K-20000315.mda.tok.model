year issues overview historically  computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields had to be modified to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  such software and computer systems needed to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
company products prior to december   the company tested substantially all of its products for year readiness 
in measuring year readiness  the company applied the following specifications year ready means that no value for current date will cause any interruption in operation  date based functionality must be consistent for dates prior to  during and after year  in all interfaces and data storage  the century in any date must be specified either explicitly or by unambiguous algorithms or inferencing rules  and year must be recognized as a leap year 
the company s rsa securiid authenticators are year ready 
assuming that a customer is utilizing the company s software products in conjunction with a year ready operating system  then the company s most recent software releases  rsa ace server v  rsa keon security server v  rsa keon desktop v  rsa keon agents v and above  rsa keon agent sdk  rsa keon unix platform security v  keon software products were formerly known as boks  rsa keon certificate server v  rsa softid  rsa securpc  rsa bsafe crypto c  rsa bsafe crypto j  rsa bsafe cert c  rsa bsafe ssl c and rsa bsafe ssl j are year ready 
the company s ace sentry hardware products are also year ready 
certain prior versions of the company s software products  as well as the company s acm   and hardware products  are not fully year ready  and customers were informed of the status of the company s products in the ordinary course of business 
in certain circumstances  the company has made available to customers who have implemented prior releases of the company s software products software updates to make the products year ready 
while the company has completed what it believes to be an effective year readiness testing program for its products  and although the company has not yet received any complaints from its customers about the year readiness of its products  the company s products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
such errors or defects in the company s products could result in delay or loss of revenue and diversion of development resources  which might materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
company systems the company established a year task force to determine the state of readiness of all company information technology it and non it systems  including the microprocessors contained in infrastructure products  such as card swipe entry devices  which are used at the company s facilities 
before december   the task force identified the third party equipment  software  vendors  systems and suppliers used by the company that were not year ready and replaced non year ready third party equipment and software with year ready equipment and software 
with respect to certain other business applications and systems licensed by the company from third parties including but not limited to the company s telephone systems and management information system installed in  the company relied on those licensors written representations that the applications were year ready 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant problems due to non year ready equipment or software 

table of contents costs to address year issues the company incurred direct costs to modify or replace existing systems used by the company in the operation of its business to ensure that all systems would be year ready before december  the total amounts spent by the company addressing this issue were not material 
in addition  the company spent substantial time and effort testing and evaluating its own products to determine year readiness of those products 
in the case of prior product releases that are not year ready  the company expects to devote internal engineering and customer support resources to resolving any issues for existing customers of those products 
risks to the company the company has made representations and warranties  both in contracts and in written communications  to certain of its customers regarding the year readiness of its products 
the company has reviewed all of those representations to determine the accuracy of those statements 
the company has determined that it made year readiness representations in fewer than of its customer contracts  and many of those customers have requested  and received  year ready versions of the company s products 
with respect to any contractual representation made by the company regarding year readiness that were not accurate  the company will seek to upgrade the affected customer to the company s current year ready version of the product s being used by that customer 
if the company has made a materially inaccurate statement regarding the year readiness of its products and the customer chooses not to upgrade to a year ready version of the product  the company may face the risk of one or more lawsuits from its customers alleging breach of representation 
the foregoing shall be considered a year readiness disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
certain factors that may affect future results the company s operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including  among other factors the timing of introduction or enhancement of products by the company or its competitors  the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for the company s products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of new products  market acceptance of new products  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  development of the company s direct and indirect distribution channels  and general economic conditions 
the company may not be able to grow or sustain its profitability from quarter to quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 

table of contents the company s business has historically tended to be seasonal  with revenue increasing at a higher rate in the last quarter of the year and at a lower rate in the following quarter 
the company believes that the higher rate of increase during the last quarter is due to the company s quota based compensation plans  year end budgetary pressures on the company s customers and the tendency of some of the company s customers to implement changes in enterprise network or data security just before the end of the calendar year 
in addition  revenue tends to increase at lower rates in the summer months  particularly in europe  when businesses defer purchase decisions 
the company s stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during  the company s stock price ranged from a per share high of to a low of 
at the close of the market on february   the company s stock price was 
announcements  litigation developments and the company s ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to its operating and financial results may contribute to this volatility 
the company may not discover  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfalls until the end of a quarter  which may result in an immediate drop in the company s stock price 
securities class action litigation is often instituted against publicly traded companies after a period of volatility in the market price of the companies securities 
in december  some of the company s stockholders filed a class action against the company and some of its officers and directors 
this litigation  and other litigation if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the market for the company s products is new and still developing 
an increasing number of businesses  government agencies and individuals are using computer networks  including enterprise wide and remote computing  as well as the internet  intranets and extranets 
because these computer networks enhance the ability of users  both authorized and unauthorized  to access sensitive and proprietary information and resources  demand for the company s enterprise network and data security products has increased as well 
with this growth of computer networks has also come a growing use of public and private keys  digital signatures and digital certificates for verifying user identities and establishing information access privileges for users in an enterprise 
this growth may not continue 
the use of computer networks to conduct business and enhance authorized access to information and resources is relatively new  and many business and government agencies will need to invest substantial resources and make major changes in their ways of doing business in order to benefit from computer networks 
many businesses and government agencies may be reluctant to make these investments and changes and may be deterred from using computer networks for a number of reasons  including actual or perceived inadequacies in the development of network and internet infrastructure and the lack of cost effective  high speed service  concerns about the security of communications and commerce over computer networks  the complexity of developing and administrating computer networks  and the difficulty of integrating business applications on computer networks and the incompatibility of different business and security applications 
in addition  the distribution channels for the company s products are changing 
for example  the company believes that an increasing number of businesses are choosing to rent access to enterprise applications from application service providers and other vendors  rather than buying the applications and investing the resources required to set up their own computer networks 
as new distribution channels evolve  the company may need to adjust its sales strategy to address these channels 

table of contents demand for the company s products depends highly on the continued growth in the use of computer networks to allow users access to confidential and proprietary information and resources 
this demand depends on  among other things the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over computer networks  market acceptance and use of public and private key cryptography  digital signatures and digital certificates in communication and commerce  the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of the company s products over its competitors products  the pace of technological change  both in the development and use of computer networks generally and in the hardware and software environments in which the company s products operate  and the company s ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions 
a well publicized actual or perceived breach of network or data security could trigger a heightened awareness of computer abuse  resulting in an increased demand for security products such as those offered by the company 
on the other hand  an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at the company or one of the company s customers  whether or not the breach was caused by the failure of one of the company s products  could hurt the company s reputation and cause potential customers to turn to competitors products 
for example  in february  a third party attacker briefly redirected the company s www 
rsa 
com url which is one of the company s inactive web sites that points users to the company s main web site to a false rsa 
com site 
although the company s security was not compromised in any way  the company believes that the public may have perceived that the company or its products were less secure because of this incident 
in addition  although the effectiveness of the company s identification and authentication products does not depend on the secrecy of its proprietary algorithm  the public disclosure or breaking of this algorithm could lead the public to believe that the company s products have been compromised  which could reduce demand for the company s products 
changes in e security technology and standards could render the company s products obsolete 
the market for e security products is fast moving and evolving 
e security technology is constantly changing as the company and its competitors introduce new products and retire old ones and as customer requirements quickly develop and change 
in addition  the standards for e commerce and network security are continuing to evolve 
if any segments of the company s market adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with the company s products and technology  sales of the company s products in those market segments could decline 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products with features that meet changing customer requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
however  the company may not be successful in introducing new or enhanced products 
a number of factors  including the following  could have an adverse impact on the success of a product delays or difficulties in product development  quality  reliability or security failure problems  which could result in returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in the company s competitive position  undetected software errors or bugs in the final products shipped to the company s customers  which could cause market acceptance of the products to be lost or delayed  recalls of hardware products incorporating the software or loss of data  
table of contents the company s competitors introducing their new products ahead of the company s new products or introducing superior or cheaper products  the market s failure to accept new technologies  the company s failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and implementation of standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in the company s products 
the company s success depends on the success of the rsa keon product line 
during  the company launched its rsa keon product line  a family of enterprise security solutions designed to enable organizations to support and manage the growing use of public and private keys  digital signatures and digital certificates for verifying user identities and establishing information access privileges for these users in an enterprise 
this new product line is critical to the company s strategy and the evolution of its business into new markets 
if the rsa keon product line is not successful  the company s financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
all of the factors listed above as affecting the success of new products generally also affect the rsa keon product line 
in addition  rsa keon s success especially depends on market acceptance of digital certificate and public and private key management technologies 
transactions for the rsa keon products often involve large expenditures by the company s customers  and the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
the long nature of the sales cycles may impact the company s quarterly results of operations 
the sales cycles for these transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the timing of customers budget cycles  and customers internal review process 
the company must manage its growth 
the company s business has grown significantly in size and complexity over the last few years 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management and operations 
in addition  the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support its growth 
the geographic dispersal of the company s operations may also make it more difficult to manage its growth 
the company s market is highly competitive 
the company competes with established e security companies that currently offer network security products or services  newly organized e security companies that are developing new  competitive products and technologies  and established computer hardware or software companies that introduce their own network security products  either separately or bundled with their existing hardware or software products 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to leverage an installed customer base  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company can 
the company believes that maintaining its competitive position will require it to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing 
the company may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain its competitive position 
in addition  current and potential competitors may establish collaborative relationships to increase their ability to address the security needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances that emerge could pose unforeseen competitive threats 
the company must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
one of the company s business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than the company could reach alone through its direct sales and marketing efforts 
if the company is unable to create relationships with strategic partners  then it will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
the company may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into potential relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the 
table of contents relationships the company does enter into may not be successful 
since the company s strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  the company s strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of the company s products either on their own or in collaboration with the company s competitors 
the company s products are subject to export regulations 
under new regulations issued by the us department of commerce in january  encryption products of any key length  including general purpose encryption tools such as the company s rsa bsafe products  may be exported  after a one time technical review  to all end users other than governmental end users 
the company believes that it has completed the necessary technical reviews of the products and services it currently exports 
following export of certain of its products  the company will be subject to various post shipment reporting requirements 
encryption products may be exported to governmental end users under special encryption licensing arrangements or individual export licenses which may be issued at the discretion of the us department of commerce 
these regulations may be modified at any time  and there can be no assurance that  in the event of any such modification  the company will be authorized to export encryption products from the united states without a license 
if there is such a modification  the company might be at a disadvantage in competing for international sales as compared to companies located outside of the united states that would not be subject to such restrictions 
international sales make up a significant portion of the company s business 
international sales accounted for more than of the company s revenue in each of the years ended december   and there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcement of intellectual property rights  and political instability 
the company depends on us and foreign intellectual property laws and agreements to protect its rights in its technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary technology 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  distributors and strategic partners as well as with its customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information  and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  these steps may prove inadequate to keep other parties from misappropriating the company s technology or from developing their own competitive versions of the company s technology 
the company s issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of the company s patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
the company relies heavily on patents to protect its proprietary rights in its technology  but it is possible that any patent owned or held by the company or its licensors might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is also possible that the company s pending or future patent applications may not be within the scope of claims sought by the company 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the inability of the company 
table of contents to adequately protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
one of the company s important patents will expire during a patent developed at the massachusetts institute of technology us patent no 
 and licensed to the company will expire on september  an implementation of the cryptographic algorithm described in this patent is embodied in the company s rsa bsafe cryptographic tool products 
to date  the company has vigorously enforced its exclusive rights to the patented technology against infringers who have released  or threatened to release  competing products that use the invention embodied in the patent 
the company does not know what effect the expiration of the patent will have  but it believes that the expiration may encourage competitors to market competing products that previously would have infringed the patent 
the encryption industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  the company has received correspondence alleging that its products may infringe patents held by third parties 
in addition  foreign parties have recently claimed that the company s use of its trademarks abroad infringe their trademarks  and third parties located in the us and abroad may assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
the company is and has been involved in litigation relating to its intellectual property rights in its products 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in the company s favor  litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources  and if a court or other government agency rules against it in any intellectual property litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages  which could include treble damages 
cryptographic technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of the company s cryptographic technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could make some or all of the company s products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s cryptographic systems depend in part on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the security afforded by the company s encryption products is based on the assumption that the factoring of the composite of large prime numbers is difficult 
if an easy factoring method were developed  then the security of the company s encryption products would be reduced or eliminated 
even if no breakthroughs in factoring are discovered  factoring problems can theoretically be solved by a computer system significantly faster and more powerful than those currently available 
if these improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems are ever developed  the company s business or results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the company depends heavily on key  talented employees in a competitive labor market 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
in some areas of the united states and in some foreign countries  the demand for these kinds of employees exceeds the supply of unemployed workers  and many firms are competing for the few employees with the skills the company needs 
the company believes that its compensation plans are competitive  but it may not be able to hire and retain the employees it needs 
acquisitions may hurt the company s business 
a component of the company s business strategy is to seek to buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment the company s existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
the company 
table of contents may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  the company may need to raise additional funds by selling its stock or borrowing money 
the company may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the company s sale of its stock may result in the dilution of the company s existing stockholders 
even if the company does complete any given acquisition  the integration of the business and operations of the acquiree into the company s business and operations is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
before any acquisition  each company has its own business  culture  customers  employees and systems 
following an acquisition  the company and the acquiree must operate as a combined organization using common communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices 
in order to successfully integrate acquired companies  the company must  among other things  successfully attract and retain key management and other personnel  integrate  both from an engineering and a sales and marketing perspective  the acquired products into the company s suite of product offerings  coordinate research and development efforts  integrate sales forces  and consolidate duplicate facilities 
an acquisition may disrupt ongoing operations  divert management from day to day business and adversely impact the company s results of operations 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such things as transaction expenses  amortization of goodwill  or expensing of in process research and development expenses 
the company depends on a limited number of suppliers for some of its product components 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some components are currently available only from limited sources 
for example  the company purchases the microprocessor chips contained in its securid smart cards and pinpads only from sanyo electric co  ltd  and epson electronics  a japanese computer chip manufacturer  is the company s only supplier of microprocessor chips for the securid key fobs 
in addition  flextronics international  a singapore corporation  is the sole manufacturer of the company s securid smart cards and pinpads 
if the company were unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these or any other components  then the company may be unable to fill customer orders and would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers 
even if the company were able to find new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to produce the components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
the company licenses from progress software corporation the relational database management software contained in the company s ace server and keon software  and the company relies on progress software for ongoing maintenance and support for the licensed software 
the company also licenses certain technology such as its ldap directory from netscape corporation and relies on netscape for ongoing maintenance and support for this licensed technology 
if any of the licensed technology were to fail or experience significant problems in functioning  then the company would not be able to fix the problem without the support of progress or netscape 
the value of the company s business may fluctuate because the value of some of its assets fluctuates 
a portion of the company s assets includes the equity securities of both publicly traded and non publicly traded companies 
in particular  the company owns a significant number of shares of common stock of verisign and trintech  both of which are publicly traded companies 
the market price and valuations of the securities that the company holds in these and other companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which the company has no control 
fluctuations in the market price and valuations of the securities that the company holds in other companies may result in fluctuations of the market price of the company s common stock and may reduce the amount of working capital available to the company

will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion  if any  of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
some provisions of the company s charter and the company s adoption of a rights plan may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
the company has a classified board of directors and has also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company 
while these provisions are intended to enable the board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk except as set forth below  the company does not generally use derivative financial instruments and generally purchases its marketable securities in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government and federal agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of ten years or less 
the company does not expect any material loss from its marketable security investments and therefore believes that its potential interest rate exposure is not material 
the company also makes equity investments determined by the board of directors to be strategic to the company and routinely evaluates the realizable value of these investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
during september  one of the company s investments  trintech  concluded an initial public offering of its ordinary shares 
the company is restricted in its right to sell the trintech shares until march  by certain provisions of an agreement between the company and the underwriters of the trintech offering 
at december  the company held  shares of trintech 
to protect a portion of its marketable securities position  the company sold put and call options on its verisign shares to independent third parties 
the put options entitle the holders to buy shares of verisign common stock and the call options allow the company to sell shares of verisign common stock on certain dates at specified prices  or permit a net share settlement at the company s option 
this provides the company with protection against a portion of the market risk associated with the securities in exchange for the company foregoing a portion of the potential price appreciation of the securities 
on december    shares were covered by these put and call options 
the outstanding put and call options expire between march  and september  and have strike prices ranging from to per share 
the company invoices customers primarily in us dollars and in local currency in those countries in which the company has branch and subsidiary operations 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from when customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
this exposure is offset by the company s use of local currency for operating expenses incurred in those countries 
historically  the company has not entered into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s financial position or results of 
table of contents operation  and therefore the company believes that its potential foreign currency exchange rate exposure is not material 
the foregoing risk management discussion and the effects thereof are forward looking statements 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets 
the analytical methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
