item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations altera designs  manufactures and markets high performance  high density  programmable logic devices and associated computer aided engineering logic development tools 
programmable logic devices are semiconductor chips that may be programmed on site  using software tools that run on personal computers or engineering workstations 
user benefits include ease of use  lower risk and fast time to market 
altera s cmos based programmable logic devices address high speed  high density and low power applications in the telecommunications  data communications  computer peripheral  and industrial markets 
flex and apex products are the company s sram based line of embedded array programmable logic devices  and max products are the company s line of eeprom and eprom based macrocell programmable logic devices 
the company classifies its products into the following categories 
new products consist of the company s volt or lower families  are manufactured on a micron or finer geometry and are made up of the flex ka ke  flex a  max a  max a b and apex k ke families 
mainstream products include the max s  max and flex k families 
mature products consist of the classic  max and flex families 
other products include tools  flashlogic  configuration devices  mplds and fsps 
sales sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales increased in from and in from increases in sales  in both years  were primarily due to increases in unit sales of new and mainstream products  which were partially offset by decreases in average unit selling prices as well as lower unit sales of mature products 
sales of new products in were million  higher than sales of million 
sales of mainstream products in were million  higher than sales of million 
sales of mature products decreased to million or in from million in  while sales of other products decreased to million or in from million in sales of new and mainstream products increased and  respectively  from to  while sales of mature and other products decreased and  respectively 
new and mainstream products together comprised of sales compared to and of sales in and  respectively 
in contrast to this  the company s mature and other products  which combined represented of sales in  were and of sales in and  respectively 
the company s new and mainstream products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years 
these products have similar or improved features and comparable or higher densities than their predecessors  but advanced process technology enables the company to produce these products at a lower cost than previous generations of products 
consistent with their lower cost structure  the company has priced these products at a significant discount to the company s mature products in order to stimulate demand and broaden the appeal of programmable logic 
as a result  the company experienced a shift in customer demand to its newer  lower priced offerings from the mature products 
new and mainstream products were of total sales in as compared to and of sales in and  respectively 
management of the company believes that lower prices on its newer product families will enable its product offering to compete more favorably with gate array and standard cell technologies  which represent significant market opportunities 
during  additional unit sales more than offset the lower selling prices and the company believes that over time this will continue  but there can be no assurances that this will occur 
in  unit sales of new and mainstream products increased and  respectively  while average unit selling prices decreased and  respectively 
in october  the company sold to cypress semiconductor corporation cypress the exclusive right to manufacture  market and sell its max programmable logic device product family a mature product family and its equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc the company recorded a pre tax gain of million 
the sale of the max family will not materially affect the company s future revenues 
excluding the max product family  sales grew in and in year over year sales growth by product category years ended december  new mainstream mature other total customer sectors accompanying the product transition was a sustained shift in customer mix towards the communications market driven primarily by growth in the networking and telecommunications sectors 
communications represented of the company s business in as compared to of total sales in and in the electronic data processing market was  and of total sales in  and  respectively 
in  the industrial  consumer and other markets comprised  and of total sales  respectively 
the company believes that future revenue growth will be driven by the product demand in the communication market  but there can be no assurances that this will occur 
geographic areas north america sales were million in  higher than sales of million 
international sales included sales in europe  japan and asia pacific and were million in  higher than million in during  sales in europe increased to million or from million in in japan  sales for increased to million or from million in and asia pacific increased to million or in from million in sales in total grew in primarily due to strength in north american and japanese networking and telecommunications sectors 
in  north america and europe sales grew and  respectively  from during  japan experienced a increase while asia pacific sales declined from owing to significant turmoil in several of the economies comprising that region 
as a percent of total sales  north america sales were  and in  and  respectively 
sales in europe were  and in  and  respectively  and sales in japan were  and for  and  respectively 
sales in asia pacific were  and of total sales in  and  respectively 
year over year sales growth by geographic area year ended december  north america europe japan asia pacific total international total major items in the statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows year ended december  cost of sales gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense interest and other income  net provision for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost reductions as a result of manufacturing process improvements and higher margins earned on the increasing mix of the company s new products 
yields on new products continued to improve for the year ended december  this includes improvements in the apex k ke  flex ke and flex ka product families 
the company also achieved cost reductions on the flex ka and flex k families through new wafer process technologies die shrinks 
the company continues to spend a significant amount of financial resources to improve production yields on both new and established products 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when the company is beginning production of new products or transitioning to new processes 
these difficulties can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
for example  in the second quarter of  difficulties in the supplier s manufacturing process limited the availability of packaging material piece parts used in certain of the company s new and proprietary fineline bga ball grid array packages causing limited production 
this in turn limited shipments of the company s new flex ke product family 
management expects to continue to introduce new and established products using new process technologies and may encounter similar start up difficulties during the transition to such process technologies 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the company s wafer suppliers  and the company may experience delays from time to time in processing some of its products which also may result in higher costs and lower product availability 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and as a percentage of sales  were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures include expenditures for labor  prototype and pre production costs  development of process technology  development of software to support new products and design environments  and development of new packages 
research and development expenses increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars for both years was primarily a result of increased headcount  spending on masks  wafers  package development and outside development services relating to the development of new products including flex ke  max a  max a b and apex k ke families  as well as development of the company s quartus software 
the increase in absolute dollars in was much higher than in primarily due to company s concentrated effort on development of new products 
historically  the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of sales has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and wafers used in development and prototyping of new products 
the company expects that  in the long term  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and will likely exceed eleven percent of sales at least through the company expects to continue to make significant investments in the development of flex ka ke  max a  max a b  apex k ke and quartus software 
during the first quarter of  the company shipped its newest family of devices  apex k ke  and its new fourth generation software design tool  quartus 
apex k ke devices utilize a new architecture for programmable logic and address higher density designs 
apex k ke devices are exclusively supported by the company s new software design tool  quartus 
management expects both apex k ke devices and quartus software to be successful in the market  however  the commercial success of these products is dependent on the acceptance of the use of apex k ke devices in high density designs and the acceptance of the quartus design software 
management can give no assurances on the market acceptance of the company s products 
the company also continues to focus its efforts on the development of new programmable logic chips  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will accomplish its goals in the development and subsequent introduction of new products and manufacturing processes 
furthermore  there is no assurance that these products will achieve market acceptance  that the new manufacturing processes will be successful  or that the suppliers will provide the company with the quality or quantity of wafers and materials that the company requires 
the company must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner to help counter the industry s historical trend of declining prices as products mature 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and as a percentage of sales  were  and in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions and incentive expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  and legal expenses 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are costs related to the direct sales force and field application engineers who work in over thirty field sales offices worldwide and stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper selection of the company s products 
the customers then work with the company s distributors for order fulfillment and logistical requirements  as over of the company s sales are made through distributors 
the company intends to continue to increase sales resources in markets and regions where it anticipates this will increase sales  enhance competitive position  or improve customer service 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars spent in was mainly driven by increased personnel expenses for marketing and administration  higher advertising and commission and incentive expenses associated with higher sales 
the slight increase in was mainly due to higher personnel expenses for marketing and administration and higher depreciation and amortization expenses associated with capital spending required to support the company s information systems  partially offset by lower legal expenses 
income from operations income from operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and as a percentage of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in income from operations as a percentage of sales from to was primarily due to improvements in gross margin partially offset by increased research and development expenses as a percentage of sales 
income from operations decreased as a percentage of sales from to primarily due to a slight decrease in gross margin 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and as a percentage of sales  were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase over the three year period primarily resulted from increased cash balances available for investment and decreased interest expense 
interest and other income expense included interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes issued in june which was comprised of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs  net of capitalized interest related to the construction of the new headquarters 
interest expense decreased in due to the conversion of the company s subordinated notes into common stock in june no interest expense was incurred in after the conversion 
in  the company also recorded a pre tax gain of million from the sale of the max programmable logic device product family and its equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc provision for income taxes altera s effective tax rate was in and and in the reduction from to was due in part to an increased amount of earned interest income from tax exempt investments and a change in the geographic mix of income 
equity investment in june  the company  tsmc and several other partners formed wafertech  llc wafertech  a joint venture company  to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in camas  washington 
in return for a million cash investment  the company received an equity ownership in the joint venture company and certain rights and obligations to procure up to of the factory s output at market prices 
in january  the company purchased from analog devices  inc an additional equity ownership interest in wafertech for approximately million  increasing its ownership interest to and enabling the company to procure up to of the factory s output at market prices 
in october  the company made an additional million cash investment in wafertech 
as a result of this additional cash investment  there were no changes to the company s ownership interest or rights and obligations for the procurement of the factory s output 
the company accounts for this investment under the equity method based on the company s ability to exercise significant influence on the operating and financial policies of wafertech 
the company s equity in the net loss of wafertech was million for  million for and was not material for production began at the wafertech joint venture in october and volume production was achieved in wafertech has yet to make a profit and has experienced lower than forecast production yields resulting in lower than forecast output 
although the company expects future wafertech production volumes and yields to increase  the ramp up of wafertech s production has been slower than forecasted and has not met the targeted level to achieve profitability 
there can be no assurances that wafertech will make a profit and that wafertech will not continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
accounting change in october  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors with an effective date of january  the company previously recognized revenue upon shipment to distributors net of appropriate reserves for sales returns and allowances 
following the accounting change  revenue recognition on shipments to distributors is deferred until the products are resold to end customers 
the company believes that deferral of revenue on distributor sales and related gross margins until the product is shipped by the distributors results in a more meaningful measurement of results of operations and is more consistent with industry practice and  therefore  is a preferable method of accounting 
the cumulative effect prior to of the change in accounting method was a charge of million net of million of income taxes or per diluted share in future results future operating results will depend on the company s ability to develop  manufacture and sell complex semiconductor components and programming software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors 
the company s efforts in this regard may not be successful 
the company is developing programmable chips for applications that are presently served by other asic vendors 
these vendors have well established market positions and a solution that has been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in displacing asic vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
furthermore  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share to the exclusion of the company 
moreover  standard cell technologies are increasingly used by the company s customers to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede the company s efforts to penetrate the asic market but may also displace the company s products in the applications that it presently serves 
the company s future growth will depend on its ability to continually  and on a timely basis  introduce new products  and to continue to improve the performance of the company s products in response to both evolving demands of the market place and competitive product offerings 
the company is highly dependent upon subcontractors to manufacture silicon wafers and assemble  test and ship product to end customers 
the company is also dependent on its wafer foundry partners to improve process technologies in a timely manner to enhance the company s product designs and cost structure 
their inability to do so could have a severe negative impact on the company 
the vast majority of the company s products are manufactured and shipped to customers by subcontractors located in asia  principally japan  taiwan  korea  the philippines  hong kong and malaysia 
disruptions or adverse supply conditions arising from market conditions  political strife  labor disruptions and other factors could have adverse consequences on the company s future results 
market demand for silicon wafers has increased significantly during the course of while supply of such wafers has increased at a much slower rate  resulting in a firmer pricing environment  less responsiveness to requests for expedited delivery by wafer suppliers  and in some cases  unsatisfied demand 
in general  the lead time to increase market wafer supply by building additional wafer fabrication facilities is approximately two years and in periods where demand for wafers increases rapidly for a prolonged period  market shortages tend to occur 
management believes that for at least the next several quarters  demand will exceed the foundry industries ability to supply silicon wafers and that certain companies that rely on the foundry industry will not be successful in securing all of the wafers that they desire  thereby constraining their revenues 
the company believes that under such circumstances it is important to have close business relationships with wafer suppliers in order to receive the desired quantity of product 
the company believes that it enjoys close working relationships with its principal wafer supplier  tsmc  and as of december   the company had in its other current assets a deposit of million for future wafer allocations from tsmc which will be utilized during  but there can be no assurance the company will be successful in securing its total desired output from tsmc or that the company s future growth will not be impaired by the scarcity of silicon wafers 
natural or man made disasters  normal process fluctuations and variances in manufacturing yields could have a severe negative impact on the company s operating capabilities 
for example  in september a major earthquake struck taiwan resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life 
the earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at the company s primary vendor  tsmc  for several days and then only limited production began 
it was nearly two weeks before full production resumed and additionally some portion of the inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake 
the company has sought to diversify its operating risk by participating in the wafertech joint venture to manufacture silicon wafers with other partners in camas  washington 
production began at the wafertech joint venture in october and volume production was achieved in wafertech has yet to make a profit and has experienced lower than forecast production yields resulting in lower than forecast output 
although the company expects future wafertech production volumes and yields to increase  the ramp up of wafertech s production has been slower than forecasted and has not met the targeted level to achieve profitability 
there can be no assurances that the worldwide supply and demand for semiconductor wafers will be such that wafertech will make a profit and that wafertech will not continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
also  a number of factors outside of the company s control  including general economic conditions and cycles in world markets  exchange rate fluctuations or a lack of growth in the company s end markets could adversely impact future results 
because of the foregoing and other factors that might affect the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors have resulted in a highly volatile price of the company s common stock 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after june  and early adoption is permitted 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company expects that its adoption of sfas no 
 which will become effective in fiscal year  will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the company has reviewed the bulletin and believes that its current revenue recognition policy is consistent with the guidance of sab no 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during  the company s operating activities generated net cash of million which was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted by non cash items including equity in loss of wafertech of million  gain on sale of max product family of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in other assets of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million

the company invested million for manufacturing and data processing equipment and software and the construction of the malaysian design and manufacturing center 
additionally  the company purchased million net of short term investments 
financing activities during  the net cash used by the company in its financing activities was million 
the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock to employees through various option and employee stock purchase plans 
in addition  the company received million from the sale of put warrants 
during  the net cash used by the company in its financing activities was million 
the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock to employees through various option and employee stock purchase plans 
financial condition since its inception  the company has used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash generated from operations to support its operating activities 
as of december   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to finance future growth 
management believes that capital expenditures will increase in primarily due to anticipated higher expenditures in manufacturing and data processing equipment as well as building improvements in its headquarter facility 
the company believes the available sources of funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance current operations and capital expenditures through at least year compliance pursuant to its year yk compliance program  the company undertook various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
as used herein  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly considered information technology it systems eg  accounting  data processing and telephone systems as well as those that are not commonly considered it systems eg  manufacturing equipment  building and facility operations systems 
in addition  the company reviewed the software products it sells  and has upgraded and will upgrade such products to offer full yk compliance 
as of the end of  all computer equipment and software that are material to altera s internal business operations and all software products that altera sells were fully compliant with yk standards  specifically disc pd as published by the british standards institute 
the company has not incurred and does not anticipate that it will incur material expenditures for the remediation of any yk issues 
the company has not been adversely impacted by yk issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
nor have any of the company s customers reported any yk problems with respect to software products sold by the company 
employees the number of employees was   and  in  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of in over and in over impact of currency and inflation the company purchases the majority of its materials and services in us dollars  and its foreign sales are transacted in us dollars 
at the end of  the company had no open forward contracts 
the company may choose to enter into such contracts from time to time should conditions appear favorable 
effects of inflation on altera s financial results have not been significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company has international subsidiary operations and is  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  the exposure to the company related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december  and  the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
