general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charge fees  commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
on june   the bank became a state chartered trust company and the company became a one bank holding company 
this change brought with it an additional set of regulations and new regulators for the bank and company 
these changes are not expected to be material to the overall operations or profitability of the company 
potential impact of accounting principles to be implemented in the future the fasb recently adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the effective date of sfas no 
has been delayed by sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june   but may be implemented early as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance 
sfas no 
may not be applied retroactively 
management believes the adoption of sfas no 
 which the company expects to initially adopt for its year ending december   will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
year issue the year issue that confronted the company and its suppliers  customers and competitors  centered on the inability of computer systems to recognize the year many computer programs and systems were originally programmed with six digit dates that provided only two digits to identify the calendar year in the date field 
with the new millennium  there was concern that these programs and computers might recognize as the year rather than the year the company has had no significant problems relating to the year date change  however  management continues to monitor all systems for potential problems 
in addition  nothing has come to management s attention regarding any year problems experienced by its customers or suppliers that have significantly impacted or are expected to significantly impact the company 
asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses brokered deposits and federal home loan bank the fhlbank advances with various maturities to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   the ratio of great southern s one year gap to total assets was a positive and its ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability committee may determine to increase great southern s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain its net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
interest rate risk exposure estimates are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the company s interest rate risk

the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial  commercial construction and consumer 
total investment securities increased by million  which was primarily an increase in available for sale united states government agency securities 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily due to increased customer cash requirements attributable to the year issue 
total liabilities increased million from december   to december  fhlbank advances increased million 
short term borrowings increased million with the addition of million in federal funds purchased and million in united states government agency securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements 
deposits increased million due primarily to an increase in certificates of deposit of million  of which million related to brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are an attractive funding source due to the ability to obtain large amounts quickly and the fact that brokered deposits do not require the collateral pledging that fhlbank advances do 
the increase in certificates of deposit was partially offset by the decrease in checking and savings accounts of million

the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions and regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
non performing assets decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  non performing loans decreased  or  from million at december   to million at december   and foreclosed assets declined million  or  from million at december   to  at december  potential problem loans decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  these are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems which may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current loan repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in the non performing loans 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition

these obligations include the credit needs of customers  funding deposit withdrawals  and the day to day operations of the company 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans 
as a result of the company s management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
at december   the company had commitments of approximately million to fund loan originations  issued lines of credit  outstanding letters of credit and unadvanced loans 
management continuously reviews the capital position of the company and the bank to insure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements  as well as exploring ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means

the company utilizes particular sources of funds based on the comparative costs and availability at the time 
the company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and  when believed to be appropriate  supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds 
statements of cash flows 
during the years ended december  and june  and  and the six months ended december   the company had positive cash flows from operating activities and positive cash flows from financing activities 
the company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during each of these same time periods 
cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the statements of cash flows have been primarily related to net income adjusted for accrued assets and liabilities  the provision for loan losses and losses on foreclosed assets  depreciation  sale of foreclosed assets and the amortization of deferred loan fees and discounts premiums on loans and investments  all of which are non cash or non operating adjustments to operating cash flows 
as a result  net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items was the primary source of cash flows from operating activities 
operating activities provided cash flows of million  million  million  and million during the years ended december   and june  and  and the six months ended december  during the years ended december   and june  and  and the six months ended december   investing activities used cash of million  million  million  and million  respectively  primarily due to the net increase of loans and the net purchase of investment securities in each period 
changes in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the statements of cash flows are due to changes in deposits  changes in fhlbank advances and changes in short term borrowings as well as purchases of treasury stock and dividend payments to stockholders 
financing activities provided million  million  million and million for the years ended december   and june  and  and the six months ended december   respectively

the board of directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments 
common stock repurchases 
the company has been in various buy back programs since may during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of treasury stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
during the six months ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of treasury stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
management intends to continue its stock buy back programs as long as repurchasing the stock contributes to the overall increase of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market
