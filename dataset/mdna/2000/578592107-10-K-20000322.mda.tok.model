maytag s policy is to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency denominated export sales transactions  which are denominated primarily in canadian dollars  for periods not exceeding twelve months 
at december   the result of a uniform percent strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which maytag s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ended december  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices

to reduce the effect of changing raw material prices for select commodities  maytag has entered into long term contracts and commodity swap agreements with terms not exceeding two years  to hedge a portion of its anticipated raw material purchases on selected commodities 
at december   the result of a uniform percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements would result in no significant decrease in net income for the year ended december  maytag also is exposed to interest rate risk in the portfolio of maytag s debt 
the company uses interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates

however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively affected if its customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues
