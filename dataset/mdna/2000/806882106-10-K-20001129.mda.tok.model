item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products on the us west coast 
for example  increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal however  primarily due to the asian financial crisis  which severely curtailed demand and decreased prices  fiscal and results for the metals recycling business were negatively impacted 
during fiscal  the company saw demand for recycled metal rise  but unusually large supply became available in certain of the countries that were part of the former soviet union  which held prices down 
in addition domestic demand for finished steel products was strong  but lower cost imports  primarily from asia  caused average prices to generally decline 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business  and the breakdown of income from operations between the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business and joint ventures 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total sales to the steel manufacturing business sales to unaffiliated customers steel manufacturing business total schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued income loss from operations year ended august  in millions metals recycling business steel manufacturing business joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals corporate expense intercompany eliminations income from operations ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business are made at a negotiated rate per ton that is intended to approximate market 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business increased resulting in an overall improvement in consolidated revenues of million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal the strengthening asian economies had a particularly positive impact on volume and prices for the metals recycling business in fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of both higher volumes and higher average selling prices  both of which were primarily caused by the rebounding asian economies 
ferrous volumes increased  tons while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased per ton to per ton 
the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons during fiscal compared with export shipments totaling  tons during the prior year 
domestic third party tonnage increased by to  tons 
sales to the company s steel business decreased by to  tons 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices 
increased exports and a strong domestic market were primarily responsible for the nonferrous improvements  as well as the metals recycling business ability to produce more nonferrous products 
nonferrous volumes increased million pounds and the average selling price increased per pound 
the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
although the volume of finished steel products sold increased  the average selling price per ton declined 
sales of finished steel products increased to  tons as strong demand enabled the company to substantially increase production and sales of wire rod products 
however  the average selling price declined per ton to per ton 
the decline in average selling prices is primarily attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by asian companies on the west coast 
the decline in the average selling price is also partially due to a change in product mix 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business shipped proportionately more lower priced products principally wire rod than in the prior year 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million to million and decreased as a percentage of revenues to  compared with in fiscal gross profit increased by million to million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased due to increased foreign demand for processed metal that directly impacted the demand for and cost of unprocessed metals 
the increase in the cost of unprocessed metal was more than offset by the increase in the average selling price increasing gross profit million compared with the previous fiscal year 
income from operations for fiscal increased million compared with fiscal  primarily due to the stronger asian economies 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million 
cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  declined by per ton primarily due to increased production that spread the allocation of fixed costs over more tons 
lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton  but increased sales volume resulted in a gross profit of million which was million higher than in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million 
of this increase  million was due to annual salary merit increases and additional bonus accruals based on significant improvement in results during fiscal fiscal expenses also included million in write offs of uncollectible debts

the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped 
also  fiscal revenues include a full year s results of a joint venture organized in the third quarter of fiscal shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strengthening asian and other foreign economies 
in fiscal  the company s equity in income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business was adversely affected by million to reflect the company s share of lifo inventory adjustments 
in comparison  the results for fiscal benefited from million of lifo and other inventory adjustments 
the company s equity in income from the joint ventures in the metals recycling business for fiscal included the company s million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to higher ferrous selling prices 
interest expense

average borrowings of million in fiscal exceeded average borrowings in fiscal of million 
the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets 
in fiscal  the company and its outside board members approved the sale of a ship leased by the company from a related party to export recycled metal 
the sale resulted in a million loss 
fiscal results included the steel manufacturing business sale of its union city  california mill depot  resulting in a gain of million 
other income

by acquiring proler in  the company succeeded to million of nols incurred in proler s pre acquisition years 
federal income tax law limits the amount of proler pre acquisition nols that can be used by the company to million per year 
however  to the extent the respective annual limit exceeds taxable income for a taxable year  the unused excess may be carried over and used in subsequent taxable years 
previous federal tax rules limited the use of the proler nols to offset taxable income only from the acquired proler entities 
the new rules now allow the company to use the proler nols to offset taxable income from all sources 
during fiscal  federal income tax law changes were enacted that allow the company somewhat greater flexibility in utilizing the proler nols 
these changes allowed the company to utilize the annual limit of million for fiscal as well as an additional million of excess limit amounts from prior years 
subject to these annual utilization limits  the remaining million of proler nols may be used in future years until they expire at various amounts in fiscal through fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business decreased resulting in an overall decline in consolidated revenues of to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the asian financial crisis which began during fiscal continued to impact the results of both operations in fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  a decrease of million 
ferrous revenues declined million to million as a result of both lower volumes and lower average selling prices  both of which were primarily caused by the financial crisis in asia 
ferrous volumes declined  tons while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined per ton to per ton 
the metals recycling business made export shipments  aggregating  tons  during fiscal compared with export shipments totaling  tons during the prior year 
domestic third party tonnage declined by to  tons

form k part ii continued the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues for fiscal of million  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
although the volume of finished steel products sold increased  the average selling price per ton declined 
sales of finished steel products increased to  tons 
however  the average selling price declined per ton to per ton 
the company feels that the decline in average selling prices was attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by asian companies on the west coast 
the decline in the average selling price was also partially due to a change in product mix 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business shipped proportionately more lower priced products than in the prior year 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold declined million to million and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit declined by million to million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold decreased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton declined  as the company lowered the purchase price of recycled metals at the scale in response to declining selling prices 
however  because the average selling prices declined at a higher rate than the price of unprepared metal  gross profit for the metals recycling business declined million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold for the year ended august  was lowered by a million reversal of environmental reserves 
an independent consultant was engaged to review the company s environmental issues and to determine its potential liabilities 
based upon the completion of certain projects at less than anticipated costs  certain previously established reserves were eliminated 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business declined million despite higher volumes sold during fiscal cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  declined by per ton primarily due to lower recycled metals prices 
the impact of lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton  however  resulting in a gross profit of million which was million lower than in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses declined million to million as the company endeavored to contain overhead costs 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business  joint venture suppliers of metals   schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal 
the decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower ferrous selling prices  the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the increase in ferrous recycled metal was partially due to the fact that one of the joint ventures was organized during fiscal and  thus  fiscal s results only reflect a portion of a year s sales 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to the asian financial crisis and a weaker domestic market which reduced demand in those countries that traditionally purchase a large share of the worldwide supply 
the company s equity in income from the joint ventures in the metals recycling business for fiscal included the company s million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property 
additionally  the results for fiscal also benefited from million of lifo and other inventory adjustments  compared with million for the prior year 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal declined from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to severe weather conditions in california during the first part of fiscal which impacted demand and  thus  results of the company s pick n pull joint venture 
additionally  prices received for the auto bodies by this joint venture were lower than in the prior year due to weakness in the recycled metals markets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million due to increased average borrowings  the effect of which was partially offset by lower average interest rates 
average borrowings of million in fiscal exceeded average borrowings in fiscal of million 
the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets

income tax provision 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was predominantly due to the lower taxable income relative to the amount of non deductible goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated by operations was million  which was comparable to million for the same period last year 
the increase in cash provided by growth in net income was largely offset by the impact of higher accounts receivable resulting from greater export demand as well as from the timing of larger export shipments and the related collection of the receivable 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
as part of its acquisitions of proler and mmi  the company assumed environmental liabilities aggregating million as of august  the company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued the company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement of million

the company believes that the current cash balance  internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases and debt service requirements for the next year 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
moreover  the company may from time to time issue other forward looking statements 
one can generally identify these forward looking statements through the use of words such as expect  believe  and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements  as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they are likely to address the company s business strategy  financial projections and results and global factors affecting the company s financial prospects 
examples of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following supply and demand conditions  the company s ability to mitigate the effects of lower cost imports  fiscal policy in both the us and abroad  competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies  supply and availability of unprocessed metals  fluctuations in recycled metals prices  seasonality of results  and assumptions surrounding the tax provision such as the timing and use of tax credits  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the general profitability of the company s operations 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates 
because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to fair value of financial instruments in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as discussed in note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the company was committed to interest rate swaps on a revolving credit facility at august  if market rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal or fiscal  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income  after considering the effects of the interest rate swaps  would not have been material
