the company also operates solid and hazardous waste landfills  municipal and hazardous waste incinerators  water and waste water treatment facilities  hazardous waste treatment facilities  waste fuel powered independent power facilities  and constructs treatment or disposal facilities for third parties internationally 
the company s diversified customer base for its nasw operations  was approximately million customers as of december  this customer base includes commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers  other waste management companies  governmental entities and independent power markets  with no single customer accounting for more than of the company s operating revenues during the company employed approximately  people as of december  of which approximately  related to its nasw operations 
the company s operating revenues from waste management operations consist primarily of fees charged for its collection and disposal services 
operating revenues for collection services include fees from residential  commercial  industrial  and municipal collection customers 
a portion of these fees are billed in advance  a liability for future service is recorded upon receipt of payment and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided 
fees for residential and municipal collection services are normally based on the type and frequency of service 
fees for commercial and industrial services are normally based on the type and frequency of service and the volume of waste collected 
the company s operating revenues from its disposal operations consist of disposal fees known as tipping fees charged to third parties and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly 
tipping fees are based on the volume of waste being disposed of at the company s disposal facilities 
fees are charged at transfer stations based on the volume of waste deposited  taking into account the company s cost of loading  transporting  and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site 
intercompany revenues between the company s operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
operating expenses from waste management operations include direct and indirect labor and the related taxes and benefits  fuel  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  and accruals for future landfill final closure and post closure costs 
certain direct development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed  and include acquisition  engineering  upgrading  construction  capitalized interest  and permitting costs 
all indirect expenses  such as administrative salaries and general corporate overhead  are expensed in the period incurred 
at times  the company receives reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to past and future environmentally related remedial  defense and tort claim costs at a number of the company s sites 
such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses 
general and administrative costs include management salaries  clerical and administrative costs  professional services  facility rentals  provision for doubtful accounts  and related insurance costs  as well as costs related to the company s marketing and sales force 
depreciation and amortization include i amortization of the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses on a straight line basis over a period not greater than years commencing on the dates of the respective acquisitions  ii amortization of other intangible assets on a straight line basis from to years  iii depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from to years  and iv amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site 
the remaining capacity of a site is determined by the unutilized permitted airspace and expansion airspace when the success of obtaining such an expansion is considered probable 
effective as of the third quarter of  the company applied a newly defined  more stringent set of criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining an expansion to landfill airspace at existing sites  which are as follows personnel are actively working to obtain land use  local and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  at the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life  it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  the respective landfill owners or the company has a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional final closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
additionally  to include airspace from an expansion effort  the expansion permit application must generally be expected to be submitted within one year  and the expansion permit must be expected to be received within two to five years 
exceptions to these criteria must be approved through a landfill specific approval process that includes an approval from the company s chief financial officer and prompt review by the audit committee of the board of directors 
such exceptions at landfill locations at december  were generally due to permit application processes beyond the one year limit  which in most cases  were due to state specific permitting procedures 
generally  the company has been successful in receiving approvals for expansions pursued  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining landfill expansions in the future 
as disposal volumes are affected by seasonality and competitive factors  airspace amortization varies from period to period due to changes in volumes of waste disposed at the company s landfills 
airspace amortization is also affected by changes in engineering and cost estimates 
accounting charges and adjustments during  the company initiated a comprehensive internal review of its accounting records  systems  processes and controls at the direction of its board of directors 
as discussed below  and in note to the financial statements  the company experienced significant difficulty in the integration and conversion of information and accounting systems subsequent to the wm holdings merger  including certain financial systems and its billing systems 
as a result of these systems and process issues  and other issues raised during the accounting review  certain charges and adjustments were recorded  as discussed below 
the review was completed in time such that the company was able to record related adjustments in its financial statements for the quarter ended september  the amounts recorded by the company as a result of the review had a material effect on its financial statements for the year ended december  the following is a summary of charges attributable to this review which were recorded for the quarter ended september  in thousands held for sale adjustments  increase to allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable adjustments  asset impairments excluding held for sale adjustments  insurance reserves and other insurance adjustments  legal  severance and consulting accruals  merger and acquisition related costs  other charges and adjustments  including account reconciliations  loss contract reserve adjustments  increase in environmental liabilities  other   impact of charges before income tax benefit  income tax benefit  after tax charges  the charges described above  which include both recurring and nonrecurring items that have been aggregated for this presentation  are reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended december   as follows in thousands allowance for doubtful accounts insurance legal  and other reserves severance merger and held for accounts other and other and acquisition sale receivable asset insurance consulting related adjustments adjustments impairments adjustments accruals costs operating revenues  costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items    loss from continuing operations held for sale  net of minority interest loss from operations       other income expense interest expense interest income minority interest interest other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary items       benefit from income taxes net loss total other includes charges recurring and and non recurring adjustments items operating revenues   costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below   general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items   loss from continuing operations held for sale  net of minority interest loss from operations   other income expense interest expense interest income   minority interest other income expense   loss before income taxes and extraordinary items   benefit from income taxes  net loss  subsequent to the completion of the accounting review  and in conjunction with the process of preparing its monthly financial statements during the fourth quarter of and on a final basis at december   additional adjustments attributable to the reconciliation of intercompany accounts  cash  accounts receivable  fixed assets  accounts payable and certain other accounts were recorded 
the company recorded significant adjustments in the third and fourth quarters of  certain of which affect periods prior to these quarters 
accordingly  the company  after consultation with its independent public accountants  has concluded that its internal controls for the preparation of interim financial information did not provide an adequate basis for its independent public accountants to complete reviews of the quarterly financial data for the quarters during the company believes that certain charges that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of may relate to individual prior periods  however  the company does not have sufficient information to identify all specific charges attributable to prior periods 
if identification of all specific charges attributable to individual prior periods were possible  the company believes that the reported results of operations presented in note to the financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of would have been favorably impacted  and the reported results of operations for the first and second quarters of would have been adversely impacted 
in connection with the preparation of its third quarter financial statements  the company concluded  based on its quantitative and qualitative analysis of available information  after consultation with its independent public accountants  that it did not have  nor was it able to obtain  sufficient information to conclude what amount of the charges relate to any individual prior year  although qualitative analysis indicates that these charges are principally related to accordingly  the company has concluded that these charges were appropriately reflected in the annual financial statements 
in connection with the comprehensive internal review  the company determined that it was necessary to stabilize its accounting systems and procedures and the maintenance of its books and records  and to establish an adequate control environment 
as an initial step in this process  it contracted with outside consulting accountants to provide accounting support to assist the company s corporate and field financial personnel with the analysis necessary to prepare the company s third quarter of financial statements 
these consulting accountants also provided such assistance in the fourth quarter of and will continue to do so until the company has the corporate and field financial resources needed to provide reasonable assurances that it can comply with the recordkeeping and internal control requirements applicable to sec registrants 
since the third quarter of  the company has added approximately staff members to its corporate and field financial personnel  including approximately employees primarily engaged in receivables collection and approximately employees engaged in accounting 
the company cannot estimate  at this time  how long it will take to complete the staffing and training of its corporate and field financial personnel to perform its recordkeeping responsibilities adequately without the support of outside consultants 
in addition  during this same period  the company began taking systematic and orderly steps to develop a comprehensive program to address the integrity and reliability of the company s reporting of financial information  including development of a long term plan that will establish an adequate system of internal controls 
as part of this initiative  the company formulated  and is in the process of implementing  policies that establish fundamental principles and discipline respecting certain key areas  including  among other things  accounting and control of fixed assets  intercompany balances  revenue reporting  landfill accounting and account reconciliations 
consistent with its long term plan  the company has begun drafting and adopting policies and procedures that will establish a foundation for its financial and accounting functions to support ongoing improvements  and develop and install mechanisms for directing  controlling and monitoring its accounting and financial organization 
the company is also evaluating its systems needs with respect to  among other things  the general ledger  revenue management and payroll 
the company cannot estimate  at this time  how long it will take to completely develop and establish an adequate internal control environment

results of operations for the three years ended december  the company s principal business is its nasw operations  which include all solid waste activities  such as collection  transfer operations  recycling and disposal 
the nasw disposal operations encompass solid waste and hazardous waste landfills  as well as waste to energy facilities 
in addition  the company operates outside of north america in activities similar to its nasw operations through its wm international operations 
as discussed above  the company s board of directors adopted a plan in to divest its wm international operations 
additionally  the company performs certain non solid waste services  primarily in north america  such as low level and other radioactive waste management  and operates waste fuel powered independent power facilities 
a substantial portion of these operations were marketed for sale in accordance with the company s strategic plan 
see business operations low level and other radioactive waste services 
through june   the company s non solid waste services also included non land disposal hazardous waste operations and on site industrial cleaning services located in north america 
however  on june   the company sold a interest in these operations to vivendi sa the company s retained interest of is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
operating revenues the company s operating revenues increased million  or in and million or in  as compared to the respective prior years 
the following presents the operating revenues by reportable segment for the respective years dollars in millions years ended december  nasw    wm international    non solid waste operating revenues    the increase in the company s operating revenues for  and is primarily due to acquisition related growth in the nasw operations 
the following table presents the company s mix of operating revenues from nasw for the respective years dollars in millions years ended december  nasw collection    disposal    transfer   recycling and other intercompany    operating revenues    acquisitions of nasw businesses during and the full year effect of acquisitions which were completed in accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately million for  as compared to nasw operating revenues also increased from internal growth of comparable operations of for  as compared to the company believes that its internal revenue growth in was detrimentally affected by certain inflexibilities in its pricing strategy and the lack of responsiveness of that strategy to localized competitive conditions  resulting in lost customers and volumes 
the company intends to continue to review its pricing strategy to enhance its competitiveness in future periods 
offsetting the increase in operating revenues were divestitures of nasw businesses with revenues of approximately million  as well as other business factors that comprised the remaining differences  including the foreign currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar 
nasw operating revenues in were lower than expected due to substantial difficulties in the integration of the operations of the company after the wm holdings merger and the eastern merger  including the company s information systems including billing systems and work flow related thereto 
in  the company experienced significant difficulty in the conversion from the wm holdings information systems to the systems currently in use  resulting in delays and errors  particularly with respect to the company s billing systems  including delays in submitting bills to customers and errors in both computing and delivering bills 
staffing levels were insufficient to address customer complaints and disputes and did not support timely follow up with customers 
billing system issues initially became evident in the second quarter of as receivable aging levels rose 
at that time  management believed that the increase in receivables was a short term issue  receivables would return to historical levels once the billing system conversions were complete and there was not a significant collectability issue with its recorded receivables 
in connection with the accounting review  the company concluded that certain of these accounts had deteriorated to the point that they may be uncollectable  and therefore  recorded an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in the third quarter of these events also contributed a higher than usual provision for uncollectable accounts in the fourth quarter of beginning in the third quarter of  the company has increased its resources dedicated to receivable collection efforts and continues to pursue collection of all outstanding balances 
the increase in operating revenues in for nasw  as compared to  is primarily attributable to the effects of acquisitions and the internal growth of comparable operations 
however  these increases were partially offset by the divestiture of certain solid waste operations and the impact of the currency translation fluctuations of the canadian dollar 
acquisitions of solid waste businesses in north america during and the full year effect of such acquisitions completed during accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately billion 
internal growth for comparable nasw services was  which was comprised of for pricing increases and for volume increases 
for  the nasw operating revenues were negatively impacted by the lower prices received for recyclable materials  which can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
had the pricing for recyclable materials remained constant during  internal growth for comparable nasw operations would have been for the period 
the operating revenues from wm international increased approximately million  or  in  but decreased approximately million  or  during  from the respective prior years 
the increase in operating revenues for wm international in is due to acquisitions of businesses  primarily in denmark and australia  with operating revenues of million and internal growth of 
these increases in were offset by the disposition of operations  primarily in italy  with operating revenues of million 
additionally offsetting the increases in operating revenues in were fluctuations in foreign currency of million 
the decrease in  as compared to is primarily due to the sale of certain assets  such as the waste to energy facility in hamm  germany in january  as well as the expiration of the city of buenos aires  argentina contract in february in  internal growth from wm international operations reflected a modest decline 
operating revenues in were also negatively affected by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million as compared to operating revenues for non solid waste services decreased in  as compared to  due to the sale of a interest in certain non solid waste operations  as previously discussed herein 
however  this decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of a geosynthetic manufacturing and installation service company in july exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions  the company s non solid waste operating revenues for were substantially consistent with operating revenues in for the company s non solid waste operations were substantially consistent with the company expects decreasing operating revenues from its non solid waste operations in future periods because the company is actively marketing certain of its non solid waste operations pursuant to its strategic plan 
operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below operating costs and expenses increased million or for  as compared to  and decreased million  or  for  as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  operating costs and expenses increased from in to in and were in for the three years ended december   operating costs and expenses increased primarily as a result of the company s acquisition activities and internal revenue growth net of dispositions 
over that three year period  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues fluctuated  primarily due to the effects of the company s merger integration plan that was adopted in connection with the wm holdings merger in july see operating revenues above 
the merger integration plan included significant employee headcount reductions particularly including supervisory operating personnel  the elimination of excess operating capacity through the sale or abandonment of certain assets and operations  and the reconfiguration of operations within certain domestic markets in which the company operates 
the company s employee headcount reductions and the elimination of excess operating capacity were largely effected in the third quarter of  while the reconfiguration of certain domestic markets began principally in the first quarter of in  soon after the wm holdings merger  the company experienced reductions  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of operating revenues  in its operating costs and expenses as a result of the reductions in employee headcount and the elimination of excess operating assets that were either sold or abandoned pursuant to the merger integration plan 
the company believes that the reductions in employee headcount and the disposition of excess operating assets resulted in short term cost efficiencies in in  the company continued the implementation of its merger integration plan 
however  due to the breadth and comprehensive nature of the changes the company attempted to implement in  the company was unable to sustain the effectiveness of its integration plan 
operating costs and expenses therefore increased significantly as a percentage of revenues in because the short term cost reductions experienced in were not sustained in and due to the operational difficulties encountered by the company 
as part of its ongoing operations  the company reviews its reserve requirements for remediation and other environmental matters based on an analysis of  among other things  the regulatory context surrounding landfills  site specific environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of changes to operational efficiencies 
accordingly  revisions to remediation reserve requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income from operations in any given period 
adjustments for final closure and post closure estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining capacity of the operating landfill 
the impact of revisions to remedial environmental and other similar liabilities resulted in reductions of operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues in the amount of and in and  respectively 
similar revisions in resulted in an increase to operating costs and expenses equivalent to of revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million or from to and decreased million or from to as a percentage of operating revenues  the company s general and administrative expense was for  for and for over the three year period ended december   general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the company s acquisition activity  partially offset by divestitures 
general and administrative expenses for include million in adjustments resulting from the accounting review  some of which are recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods 
these significant adjustments include an increase of million relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  general and administrative expenses for include million in costs for accounting  legal and other professional services 
these costs are primarily related to litigation and investigations conducted by the company in see discussion  in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses above  of the company s substantial difficulties in integrating the operations of wm holdings subsequent to the wm holdings merger 
as discussed above  the company believes it experienced short term cost reductions related to the elimination of duplicate corporate administrative functions from the wm holdings merger in and the first and second quarters of such cost reductions were substantially offset by the effect of difficulties encountered by the company in integrating the operations of wm holdings  including increased administrative costs in field operations  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of  attributable to increased costs to perform billing  collection and other administrative functions 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or in and million  or in  as compared to the respective prior year 
as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in and in over the three year period ended december   depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the company s acquisition program  partially offset by divestitures 
in addition to the increase associated with acquisitions  depreciation and amortization expense for includes adjustments resulting from the accounting review  some of which are recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods 
these adjustments primarily include adjustments to increases to landfill amortization expense as a result of the comprehensive review of the nasw landfill expansion projects 
the increase in landfill amortization as a result of this review aggregated million  or of annual revenues  for the third and fourth quarters of the company discontinued depreciation on fixed assets relative to certain operations which are held for sale as of october  the depreciation discontinued in the fourth quarter of for these operations held for sale was million  or of annual revenues  which was primarily related to the company s wm international operations 
merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items as further discussed in notes and to the financial statements included elsewhere herein  in connection with the wm holdings merger and the eastern merger  the company incurred significant merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items in of approximately billion 
in  the company incurred approximately million in merger costs and million in asset impairments and unusual items 
the merger and acquisition related costs were primarily related to these mergers and included costs that were transitional in nature 
the charge for asset impairments and unusual items primarily consisted of held for sale asset adjustments  other asset impairments and provisions for increases in certain legal reserves 
in and  the company incurred merger and acquisition related costs of approximately million and million  respectively  related to other business combinations accounted for as poolings of interests that were completed during those years 
the financial statements include a charge to asset impairments and unusual items of approximately billion related primarily to a significant accounting charge resulting from a comprehensive review performed by the management of wm holdings of its operations and investments 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion 
income loss from continuing operations held for sale  net of minority interest in and  the company had operations that were previously classified as discontinued operations for accounting and financial reporting purposes that were subsequently reclassified to continuing operations as of december   as the dispositions were not completed within one year from the date of their classification as discontinued operations 
the company divested of substantially all of such operations by september  income loss from operations income loss from operations was million  million  and million for  and  respectively  for the reasons discussed above 
other income and expenses other income and expenses consists of interest expense  interest income  other income including gains and losses on sales of businesses and minority interest 
the most significant of these is interest expense 
although the company has experienced lower borrowing rates during most of  as compared to and  interest costs  which include amounts capitalized  increased for each year from to due to increases in the company s outstanding indebtedness 
during the last six months of  the company experienced a decline in its public credit ratings 
as a result  it is likely that the borrowing rates in the foreseeable future will be higher than the rates previously experienced by the company 
capitalized interest was million  million and million  for   and  respectively 
the decline in the amount of interest capitalized by the company over these periods is primarily due to shortening of the cycles in which the company performs landfill construction activities and the success in obtaining permits at certain significant landfill expansion projects 
during  the company acquired the outstanding minority interest in wti  wm plc  as well as wm plc s operations in the united kingdom  which were owned by wessex water plc 
as a result  the minority interest expense was less significant to the company in as compared to prior years

the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs related to acquired intangibles  non deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain foreign businesses and other third quarter charges and adjustments as discussed in note to the financial statements  and the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  which are no longer permanently reinvested

accordingly  the company expensed any amounts previously capitalized  which reduced net income by million in net loss for the reasons discussed above  net loss was million in  million in  and million in liquidity and capital resources the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital investment 
the company s capital requirements primarily stem from i its working capital needs for its ongoing operations  ii capital expenditures for construction and expansion of its landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for its collection operations  iii refurbishments and improvements at its waste to energy facilities and iv business acquisitions 
the company s strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds 
historically  the company has also obtained financing from various financing sources available to the company at the time  including the incurrence of debt and the issuance of its common stock 
in august  the company announced a strategic plan that included the sale of certain non strategic and under performing assets  including its wm international operations  its non core assets and up to of its nasw operations 
the proceeds from these dispositions  which are primarily expected to be realized in  will be utilized for debt repayment  repurchase of shares and selected tuck in acquisitions 
although the company has unused and available credit capacity under its domestic bank facilities of billion at december  and billion as of march   the company expects reductions in bank line availability as debt levels are decreased in connection with the strategic plan 
however  due to a projected decrease in acquisition activity in future periods and the sale of certain of its international businesses  the company s level of capital expenditures is expected to decline along with its needs for large amounts of credit capacity 
as a result of the accounting charges and adjustments recorded in the third quarter of see note  absent waivers  the company would not have been in compliance as of september  with certain financial covenants as required by its four bank credit facilities 
the company received waivers from each of its four bank groups for the period ended september   enabling the company to be in full compliance with and have full access to its existing bank credit facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred approximately million which is included in interest expense to obtain these waivers

specifically  the company must use all of the first billion of net proceeds it receives from the sales of any domestic operations to repay indebtedness under the syndicated facility and credit facility 
additionally  of the net proceeds greater than billion but less than billion from sales of domestic operations must be used to repay indebtedness under such facilities 
finally  all net proceeds from the divestiture of wm international operations must be used to repay indebtedness under the company s eurocurrency facilities 
the net proceeds remaining after the repayment of the eurocurrency facilities will be counted as  and therefore subject to the same requirements to repay the syndicated facility and credit facility as  net proceeds received from the sales of domestic operations 
the company was in compliance with all financial requirements under its credit agreements as of december  however  the company anticipates that its cash flows from operations for the year will likely not be sufficient for the company to maintain compliance with certain of the financial ratios contained in its syndicated facility  credit facility  and eurocurrency credit facilities 
therefore  it has classified the borrowings outstanding under the syndicated facilities and the credit facility as short term obligations as of december  the eurocurrency credit facility is included in operations held for sale at december  as discussed in the preceding paragraph  the company expects to make a substantial principal reduction on these facilities with the net proceeds of its anticipated divestitures 
the company intends to pursue waivers or amendments of such agreements in advance of any potential violation of the credit agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that  in the event the company actually violates its agreements  that such waivers or amendments will be obtained 
failure to obtain such waivers or amendments would have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
during the last six months of  the company experienced a decline in its public credit ratings which curtailed its access to the commercial paper market 
all outstanding commercial paper was redeemed by march  the company does not expect that it will be in a position to reissue commercial paper in the foreseeable future 
additionally  as a result of a decline in its credit ratings  the company expects to incur substantially higher costs of financing for the foreseeable future as compared to prior years should it attempt any capital market activity 
the company utilizes approximately billion in bonding related to its operations 
should any of these bonding sources become unavailable without replacement from other bonding sources  the company would have to utilize its bank lines  which are at significantly higher rates  for replacement purposes 
as of december   the company had working capital deficit of billion a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of and a cash balance of million  which compares to a working capital deficit of million a current ratio of and a cash balance of million as of december  for  net cash provided by operating activities was billion  as compared to billion in and billion in  and net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  as compared to billion in and million in in  cash generated from operating and financing activities was primarily used to acquire business and outstanding minority interest positions for billion and for capital expenditures of billion 
in  cash generated from operating and financing activities was primarily used to acquire businesses and outstanding minority interest positions for billion and for capital expenditures of billion 
in  capital expenditures of billion and acquisitions of businesses and outstanding minority interests of billion were primarily financed through net cash from operations of billion as well as proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales of assets of billion 
additionally  in the company acquired billion of its stock and paid cash dividends to its shareholders of million 
during  the company paid approximately million for costs directly or indirectly related to the wm holdings merger and the eastern merger 
consequently  the company s net cash provided by operating activities for was significantly impacted by its merger activity  and to a lesser extent  other working capital issues 
the company contributed approximately million during  which is included in the above amounts  and expects payments of approximately million to be paid through relating to the termination of the wm holdings defined benefit plan 
furthermore  the company expects to fund additional merger and legal obligations throughout from december  through march   the company repurchased million of its convertible subordinated notes due with funds available from internally generated cash flows and its domestic credit facilities 
the company has a scheduled maturity of million of senior notes on october  the company expects to repay this senior note with funds available from its domestic credit facilities 
in the second quarter of  the company agreed to purchase all of the canadian solid waste operations of allied waste industries  inc allied other than its medical waste disposal assets the canadian operations for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
that agreement was revised and superseded on november  under the revised agreements  the company agreed to acquire the canadian operations through the purchase of the stock of allied s canadian subsidiary 
the revised agreements also provide for the purchase by allied of certain of the company s solid waste operations having combined reported historical net revenue of approximately million  including nine landfill operations  collection operations  five transfer stations and a landfill operating contract 
the prices of canadian operations to be acquired  and the domestic operations to be disposed of  by the company were all established based upon the same multiple of historical operating earnings  although the transactions may proceed separately 
the sale of the canadian operations is subject to final approval under the canadian competition act and investment canada act 
the competition bureau of canada has requested that the company divest a substantial portion of the canadian operations as a condition to recommending such approval 
in response  the company and allied are actively pursuing a restructured transaction  whereby the company would acquire only those portions of the canadian operations approved by canadian regulators 
the scope of the united states assets to be acquired by allied from the company also remains under governmental antitrust review 
environmental matters the company has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of the landfills and the capping of the final uncapped areas of the landfills  and for post closure of the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the final closure and post closure liabilities are charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the present value of total estimated final closure and post closure cost will be accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
the company has also established procedures to evaluate its potential remedial liabilities at closed sites which it owns or operated  or to which it transported waste  including sites listed on the npl 
the majority of situations involving npl sites relate to allegations that subsidiaries of the company or their predecessors transported waste to the facilities in question  often prior to the acquisition of such subsidiaries by the company 
in instances in which the company has concluded that it is probable that a liability has been incurred  an accrual has been recorded in the financial statements 
estimates of the extent of the company s degree of responsibility for remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation require a number of assumptions and are inherently difficult  and the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates 
however  the company believes that its extensive experience in the environmental services business  as well as its involvement with a large number of sites  provides a reasonable basis for estimating its aggregate liability 
as additional information becomes available  estimates are adjusted as necessary 
while the company does not anticipate that any such adjustment would be material to its financial statements  it is reasonably possible that technological  regulatory or enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies  the nonexistence or inability of other potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities  or other factors could necessitate the recording of additional liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  the company has estimated that the aggregate cost of environmental liabilities as of december  is approximately billion 
as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and billion  respectively  for the present value of final closure  post closure  and remediation costs of disposal facilities 
the difference between the final closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total present value of estimated costs represents final closure and post closure costs which will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total present value of estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
average landfill final closure and post closure expense  on a per ton basis  for was per ton 
as of december   the company also expects to incur approximately billion related to future construction activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites  which are capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
seasonality and inflation the company s operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months  which corresponds with the company s first and fourth quarters 
this is primarily attributable to the facts that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
the company believes that inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future 
year date conversion the company completed all preparation to assure its computerized information systems  embedded technologies in its equipment  and to the extent possible  its suppliers  were ready for year as a result  the company suffered no material adverse business impact with the year occurrence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and certain equity prices 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
the derivatives used are simple agreements which provide for payments based on the notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
all derivatives are related to actual or anticipated exposures of transactions of the company 
while the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and the company does not anticipate non performance 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company monitors its derivative positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
the company has performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of the company s market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from the company s assumptions 
the effects of such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect the company s assumptions 
the effects of such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect company rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect on the company from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt obligations  which are mainly denominated in us dollars 
in addition  interest rate swaps are generally used to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of the company s combined debt and interest rate swap positions at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items such as pension liabilities  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
since a significant portion of the company s debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries have used foreign currency derivatives to seek to mitigate the impact of translation on foreign earnings and income from foreign investees 
typically these derivatives have taken the form of purchased put options or collars 
there were no currency derivatives outstanding at december  or that relate to hedging the translation of foreign earnings 
the company occasionally incurs currency risk from cross border transactions 
when such transactions are anticipated or committed to  the company may enter into forward contracts or purchase options to reduce or eliminate the related foreign exchange risk 
the company also incurs exchange rate risk from borrowings denominated in foreign currencies 
an instantaneous  ten percent increase in foreign exchange rates would decrease the fair value of the company s foreign currency borrowings at december  and  by approximately million and million  respectively 
this difference can be attributed to a variety of factors  including a change in the composition of the portfolio  a change in the correlations across different instruments resulting from the wm holdings merger or other factors arising from changing market conditions 
the total effect on the company from movements in exchange rates will also be influenced by other factors 
for example  an increase in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt caused by exchange rate movements may be more than offset by an increase in the value of the company s net investment in foreign countries 
at december   all debt of wm international is classified in current assets as assets held for sale 
commodities price exposure 
the company markets recycled paper products such as old newspaper onp and old corrugated containers occ 
beginning in  the company entered into financial swaps in an effort to mitigate the risk of recyclable paper price fluctuations 
under its financial swap agreements  the company transfers a floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
the two parties agree to use a market index as an indicator of the market price during the term of the swap 
an instantaneous ten percent increase in this commodity at december  creates an exposure risk of approximately  all of the company s waste paper hedges are cash settled on a monthly basis with the counterparty 
equity price exposure 
the company is also subject to equity price exposure from company debt issues that are convertible into the company s common stock 
these debt issues had an aggregate carrying value of million and billion as of december and  respectively 
an instantaneous  ten percent decrease in the company s stock price on december  and  would increase the fair value of the company s convertible debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the change in fair value is due to the change in the company s stock price from december  to december  the company s share price fell from on december  to at the close of trading on december  however  such changes in stock prices did not impact net income
