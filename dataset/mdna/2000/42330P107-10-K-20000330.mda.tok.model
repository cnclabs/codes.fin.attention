item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview natural gas and oil prices  the offshore mobile rig count and gulf of mexico lease activity are three of the primary indicators management uses to predict the level of the company s business 
cdi s construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the continental shelf and twelve months or longer in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in natural gas and oil prices 
commodity prices declined significantly in the last half of and early resulting in the utilization of offshore mobile rigs dropping to approximately in contrast to almost full utilization in and the first half of this trend began reversing in the second quarter of such that oil prices have recently reached their highest level since the gulf war and natural gas prices are hovering in a range of mcf to mcf 
however  e p companies have been hesitant to ramp up spending and accordingly demand for the company s services remained relatively soft throughout product prices impact the company s natural gas and oil operations in several respects 
the company seeks to acquire producing natural gas and oil properties that are generally in the later stages of their economic life 
these properties typically have few  if any  unexplored drilling locations  so the potential abandonment liability is a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties which the company has purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices contributed to improved operating results for the company in  and the second half of in contrast  lower natural gas prices  as experienced in and early  contributed to lower operating results for ert in those periods and generally increased the number of mature properties acquired during those periods 
salvage operations consist of platform decommissioning  removal and abandonment and p a services performed by the company s salvage assets  ie  a stiff leg derrick barge and well servicing equipment 
in addition  salvage related support  such as debris removal and preparation of platform legs for removal  is often provided by the company s surface diving vessels 
in  management targeted platform removal and salvage operations as a regulatory driven activity which offers a partial hedge against fluctuations in the commodity price of natural gas 
in particular  mms regulations require removal of platforms within twelve months after lease expiration and also require remediation of the seabed at the well site to its original state 
the company contracts and manages  on a turnkey basis  all aspects of the decommissioning and abandonment of fields of all sizes using third party heavy lift derrick barges if necessary 
the company also has an alliance with horizon offshore gaining access to expanded derrick barge and pipelay capacity 
in  cdi launched a new full field development product line to assist cash constrained customers on the ocs 
with  platforms and production facilities already in place in the gulf our underlying premise is that each new field need not be re engineered 
adapting industry standard designs we now stock subsea trees  prefabricated modules  well panels and controls and umbilicals for immediate assembly 
that led to five full field pipelay projects in the following table sets forth for the periods presented i average us natural gas prices  ii the company s natural gas production  iii the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf of mexico  iv the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf of mexico and v the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of the company s fleet

average monthly number of rigs contracted  as reported by offshore data services 
source offshore data services  installation and removal of platforms with two or more piles in the gulf of mexico 
average vessel utilization rate is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels in this category generated revenues by the total number of days in each quarter excluding aquatica in 
vessel utilization is historically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  the company plans its drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of the company s customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
during the second quarter of  the uncle john spent days in drydock undergoing thruster work and dnv inspections 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  the company has historically generated more than up to of its consolidated revenues in the last six months of the year 
the company s operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
the company s salvage barge  which has a shallow draft  is particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions  and its utilization rate will be lower during such periods 
to minimize the impact of weather conditions on the company s operations and financial condition  cdi began operating dp vessels and expanded into the acquisition of mature offshore properties 
the unique station keeping ability offered by dynamic positioning enables these vessels to operate throughout the winter months and in rough seas 
operation of natural gas and oil properties tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand for natural gas and of strong natural gas prices 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
consolidated revenues of million in were more than the million in with natural gas and oil production providing all of the increase while subsea operations revenues declined million 
most of this decline is due to revenues including million from the charter of two coflexip stena offshore vessels 
one project in cooper abandonment for eex represented of consolidated revenues 
adding the cal dive aker dove in september and acquiring the remaining of aquatica  inc  in august and thus consolidating their results from that date forward added million to revenues  while the subcontracting of derrick and pipelay barges also added million in  offsetting the shortfall created by stacking the balmoral sea nearly the entire first half of natural gas and oil production was million in as compared to million in the increase was due mainly to a rise in production from bcfe billion of cubic feet equivalent to bcfe in as the number of blocks owned by ert was essentially doubled through property acquisitions during the first four months of revenues were also assisted by improved average gas prices mcf compared to in  an increase in oil production and prices and the sale of three offshore leases 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  from million in to million in despite an million increase in natural gas and oil production gross profit 
the decrease in subsea and salvage gross profit of million is due to the million revenue decline discussed above coupled with margins declining from in to in in addition to a decline in demand for cdi s services on the ocs in compared to  the primary reason for the margin decline was cdi s shift to prime contractor on eight major projects during which include high third party pass through costs such costs were of revenues in compared to in 
natural gas and oil production gross profit was million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was due to the aforementioned production improvement  gas and oil price increases and the gain recorded on the sale of certain offshore blocks during offset by the writedown of the carrying value of three ert fields in connection with the well exploitation program 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million in to million as compared to million in the primary reason for the decline was the lack of subsea group bonuses and staff reductions effected early in consolidation of aquatica the final five months of added million 
sg a for includes million related to ert  an increase of million over as we added new people to handle the expansion in operations 
that subsidiary s significantly increased income also triggered significantly higher bonus payments under its incentive program 
selling and administrative costs were of revenues in  two margin points better than the achieved in other income and expenses 
the company recorded  in for its share of earnings in aquatica  inc  compared to million in as beginning august  aquatica s results were consolidated with cdi s as a result of the company s acquisition of the remaining ownership in aquatica 
net interest income of  was comparable to the million earned in as cdi remained relatively debt free throughout both years 
income taxes 
income taxes were million in compared to million in due to the decreased profitability 
the effective tax rate fell from in to in due to research and development credits realized as a result of cdi s operating at the forefront of deepwater technology 
net income 
net income decreased in compared to as a result of factors described above 
diluted earnings per share decreased slightly more as a result of the additional shares issued in the aquatica acquisition 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
consolidated revenues of million in were more than the million earned during with the subsea operations contributing all of the increase while natural gas and oil production revenues declined million 
all of the increase was due to increased demand for services provided by cdi s dp vessels  particularly the uncle john  witch queen and balmoral sea which together contributed of the increase 
in addition  new vessels sea sorceress and merlin contributed million of the increase 
the charter of two coflexip stena offshore vessels  the marianos during the first quarter and the constructor in the second  added million to the revenues 
natural gas and oil revenues were million in as compared to million in the decrease was due to a decline in production from bcfe during to bcfe in and a decline in average gas prices from mcf for to mcf during the decline in production is a result of five wells going off line in the second quarter and remedial work being delayed into the fourth quarter by a lack of equipment and then by weather 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million in to million in with the uncle john  witch queen and balmoral sea making up the majority of the increase 
the remaining increase was due to improved demand for the two saturation diving vessels and the vessels which work in the shallow gulf of mexico from the shore to feet of water 
subsea and salvage margins increased from in to during due mainly to outstanding offshore performance and demand for the dp vessels 
natural gas and oil production gross profit was million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was due to the aforementioned declines in average natural gas prices and production during as compared to and to expensive efforts to re establish production in the second half of the year 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in as compared to the million includes a million provision principally for incentive compensation compared to million provided in the remainder of the increase is due to the addition of new personnel to support the company s deepwater strategy  growth in it base business and to the cost of a supply chain management consulting project 
selling and administrative costs were of revenues in  a level identical to that in other income and expenses 
the company recorded million in reflecting its share of earnings of aquatica  inc net interest income and other of million for compares to  of net interest expense and other for this improvement was due to the company remaining debt free since completion of its initial public offering of common stock in july  income taxes 
income taxes were million in as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was due to the company s increased profitability as the effective tax rate remained in both years 
roughly of the tax provision was deferred due mainly to increased depreciation in addition to the company s deepwater research and development efforts 
net income 
net income increased to million in as compared to million in as a result of factors described above 
diluted earnings per share increased percentage points less than the net income increase in  as compared to  due to the impact on weighted average common shares outstanding of the new shares issued in the july ipo 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its operating activities principally from internally generated cash flow  even during industry depressed years such as and an initial public offering of common stock was completed on july   with the sale of  shares generating net proceeds to the company of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and issuance costs 
the proceeds were used to fund capital expenditures during  and to repay all outstanding long term indebtedness 
as of december   the company had million of working capital including million of cash on hand and no debt outstanding after funding the equity investment in aquatica and million of capital expenditures in and million of capital expenditures in  which includes ert s purchase of blocks offshore  million of construction costs for the q and million for the acquisition of interest in the cal dive aker dove which was subsequently sold in a sale leaseback transaction 
subsequent to year end cdi s cash on hand increased to million at february  after funding ert s acquisition of six offshore blocks from eex 
additionally  cdi has approximately million available under a revolving credit agreement 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million provided in this decrease is primarily the result of decreased profitability of the company and the level of funding required to fund the increases in accounts receivable million required in compared to  returned in which occurred primarily as a result of the terms negotiated with eex for the cooper abandonment project 
pursuant to those terms  million was paid in january in addition  depreciation and amortization increased as a result of natural gas and oil properties acquisitions along with the write down of carrying value of three ert fields in discussed below 
the company experienced an increase in the level of funding from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million in compared to the increase relates primarily to accruals with respect to the q construction project and the eex project 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million provided in this increase was primarily the result of increased profitability and a decline in the level of funding required to fund accounts receivable increases million required in compared to  returned in 
other current assets increased million at december  as compared to december  due mainly to the purchases of materials and supplies for the start up of the full field development program 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased as a result of vessel and natural gas and oil properties acquisitions 
the company experienced improved collections of its accounts receivable during as compared to the prior year 
total accounts receivable decreased  at december  as compared to december  while revenues grew in compared to the company s average number of days to bill and collect its trade receivables decreased by days in as compared to investing activities 
capital expenditures have consisted principally of strategic asset acquisitions  the assembly of a fleet of dp vessels  including the witch queen  balmoral sea  uncle john  sea sorceress  merlin and cal dive aker dove  improvements to existing vessels and the acquisition of offshore natural gas and oil properties 
the company has consistently targeted the year as the time when we will see a significant acceleration in deepwater demand 
as a result  capital expenditures of million were over five times the prior year 
this figure includes million for the construction of the q  the acquisition of hvide marine s interest in cal dive aker  caht i  llc  the company which leases the cal dive aker dove a newbuild dp anchor handling and subsea construction vessel million as well as the purchase of new engines for the uncle john 
ert internally funded million of capital expenditures from the proceeds of the sale of offshore properties and the repayment of deferred lease abandonment costs received in one acquisition 
during the first four months of  in four separate transactions  ert acquired interests in blocks in exchange for cash consideration  as well as assumption of the pro rata share of the related decommissioning liabilities 
during  ert acquired net working interests in six blocks involving two separate fields in exchange for cash as well as assumption of the pro rata share of the related decommissioning liability 
in connection with and offshore property acquisitions  ert assumed net abandonment liabilities estimated at approximately  and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  ert substantially completed its well exploitation program  which included five recompletions and which led to the sale of its interest in three offshore blocks 
it is an operating policy that ert will sell assets offshore leases  platforms  compressors  etc 
when the expected future revenue stream can be accelerated in a single transaction 
accordingly  proceeds received from such transactions are recorded as revenue in the period received 
these sales were structured as section like kind exchanges for tax purposes 
accordingly  the cash received was restricted to use for subsequent acquisitions of additional natural gas and oil properties which  as discussed below  occurred in the first quarter of since inception ert has acquired interests in offshore leases  sold seven two in and two in  and taken one field full cycle to decommissioning 
the well exploitation work completed during the third quarter also enabled ert to assess and write down the carrying value of three ert fields  including one where a third party vendor damaged the reservoir formation 
the net result of the sales and the well exploitation program was to add approximately thirteen cents to diluted earnings per share 
during the first quarter ert acquired interests in six offshore blocks from eex corporation and agreed to operate the remaining eex properties on the outer continental shelf ocs 
the acquired offshore blocks include working interests from to in five platforms  one caisson and wells currently producing mmcf per day mmcf net 
ert exchanged cash of million and assumed eex s prorated share of the abandonment obligation for the acquired interests  and entered into a two year contract to manage the remaining eex operated properties 
eex personnel who operated these properties also became ert employees 
this acquisition was funded by restricted cash obtained from like kind sales and accordingly  the gain for the sale was deferred for tax purposes 
since  including the transactions closed subsequent to year end  the company has invested million to acquire offshore natural gas and oil leases 
the company records the amount of cash paid together with the abandonment liability assumed at the time such properties are acquired 
only the cash paid at closing is reflected in the company s statement of cash flows together with bond and escrow deposits required in connection with these purchases 
the minerals management service requires operators in the gulf of mexico to post an areawide bond of million 
beginning in the mms allowed the company to utilize an insurance carrier to provide such bonding 
the company has had  and anticipates having additional discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions including natural gas and oil properties and vessels 
however  the company can give no assurance that any such transaction can be completed 
in december   caht i entered into a sale leaseback of the cal dive aker dove 
cal dive s portion of the proceeds received totaled million and resulted in a gain of million which was deferred and is being amortized over the ten year term of the lease 
the lease  which is accounted for as an operating lease  requires caht i to make quarterly payments of  and contains a renewal option and options to purchase the vessel for amounts approximating fair market value after years of the lease term and at the end of the lease term 
in february  cdi purchased a significant minority equity interest in aquatica  inc  a surface diving company for million 
effective august    shares of common stock of cal dive were issued for all of the remaining common stock of aquatica  inc this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the acquisition price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values resulting in goodwill of million which is being amortized over twenty five years on a straight line basis 
results of operations for aquatica  inc are consolidated with those of cal dive for periods subsequent to august  the company incurred million of capital expenditures during in january  ert acquired interests in six blocks involving two separate fields from sonat exploration company for cash and assumption of sonat s pro rata share of the related decommissioning liability 
the remaining balance includes costs associated with placing the merlin in service and additions to the sea sorceress in preparation for the terra nova project as well as the cost of new steel and equipment added to the witch queen  balmoral sea and cal diver v during drydock inspections 
financing activities 
the company has financed seasonal operating requirements and capital expenditures with internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities  the sale of common stock and the sale leaseback transaction described above 
the revolving credit agreement  as amended  currently provides for a million revolving line of credit 
the revolving credit agreement  which terminates in december  is secured by trade receivables and mortgages on the company s vessels 
the revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends on the company s capital stock and contains only one financial covenant a fixed charge coverage ratio and a limitation that debt not exceed million 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is equal to prime with incentive pricing thereafter pursuant to a formula based upon ebitda as defined therein 
no borrowings were outstanding at december  letters of credit are also available under the revolving credit agreement which the company typically uses if performance bonds are required or  in certain cases  in lieu of purchasing us treasury bonds in conjunction with gas and oil property acquisitions 
the only financing activity in and represents the exercise of employee stock options 
capital commitments 
in connection with its business strategy  management expects the company to acquire or build additional vessels  acquire other assets  as well as seek to buy additional natural gas and oil properties 
in july  cdi s board of directors approved the construction of the q  a newbuild  ultra deepwater multi service vessel  at a total estimated cost of million 
the company recently received the day letter from the maritime administration regarding the application for title xi financing for this semi submersible vessel 
the letter signifies that funding is available and that cdi has satisfactorily answered marad s technical questions relative to the vessel 
if this financing transaction is approved  initial construction funding will be drawn in the second quarter of we expect to submit a supplemental appropriation of million to million to convert the sea sorceress to full dp or purchase an existing dp vessel having similar deepwater construction features 
other than building  converting or buying dp vessels  management believes existing cash balances  the net cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be adequate to meet funding requirements for the next year
