these mainland businesses are expected to contribute more meaningful operating results in the year and beyond 
european operations contributed ebitda of million for  reflecting an increase of or million over this significant ebitda gain reflects the full recognition of cost savings and revenue growth associated with the acquisition of st 
quintin and its operational merger with regl  which now operate as insignia richard ellis  and a robust real estate market in the united kingdom

insignia residential group  which saw its management portfolio expand to more than  units during  reported a increase in service revenues from million in to million in first ohio mortgage  realty one s mortgage loan subsidiary  experienced a decline in loan volume to million compared to levels  however  this result was significantly more favorable than that experienced by most competing mortgage banking companies  which generally saw loan volumes shrink by more than in the residential service operations produced ebitda gains of from million in to million in consistent with revenues  the ebitda increases are the result of the june acquisition of douglas elliman  which produced ebitda of million for the six month period since acquisition 
realty one reported an ebitda decline of to million in this decrease reflects the effects of the year over year decline in first quarter results attributable to the reversion to a more normal seasonal sales pattern in compared to the record level experienced in the first quarter of and the impact of rising interest rates on sales volume

as previously discussed see item internet initiatives  insignia anticipates such internally developed internet based business models to eventually operate as free standing enterprises through the infusion of third party capital in off balance sheet transactions 
at december   insignia had invested approximately million in the development of capitalized intellectual property for these businesses 
other items affecting net income administrative expenses rose from million in to million in this increase reflects the anticipated higher costs following the spin off as a separate company  continued growth of the company over the past year through acquisitions and expansion of services  and certain atypical expenses incurred in connection with abandoned acquisition transactions 
administrative expenses of the company through the time of the spin off in september  which totaled approximately million  consisted entirely of estimated allocations of former parent overhead costs 
interest expense increased by million over levels to million for the year 
the increase is due principally to interest charges on credit facility borrowings of approximately million to finance the acquisitions of lynch murphy  st 
quintin and douglas elliman 
interest expense for was attributable solely to asset financing consisting of realty one borrowings  principally under its warehouse line used in the origination of mortgage loans for sale  and regl borrowings substantially secured by restricted cash deposits 
the results for do not include any interest expense allocation from the indebtedness of former parent 
depreciation and amortization of intangibles exclusive of property operations increased from million in to million in these increases are the result of increased capital investments in property and equipment and acquisitions substantially comprised of purchased intangibles 
results for were adversely affected by one time charges of million for merger expenses in connection with the acquisition of st 
quintin in march and its subsequent combination with regl 
as previously noted  the one time charges substantially relate to the provision for costs associated with vacated excess office space being subleased 
earnings for were adversely affected by the one time impairment charge of million for the write down of the company s investment in insignia cagisa italy to the then estimated disposition value 
the company completed the disposition of its interest in insignia cagisa in march income taxes declined to million in  in comparison to  as a result of lower pre tax income

as a result  net income and net income per share for declined to million and  respectively 
the acquisitions of regl february  realty one october and barnes morris pardoe foster barnes morris october  together with selective acquisitions of domestic commercial real estate services firms and further expansion of services in europe during  through insignia re gmbh in germany  constituted a majority of these increases 
in addition  favorable real estate markets in the united states and united kingdom coupled with the strategic expansion of commercial services in certain key us markets during contributed to this record growth 
commercial real estate operations real estate services commercial real estate services in were conducted in the united states through insignia esg and in europe through regl in the united kingdom  insignia re gmbh in germany and insignia cagisa in italy 
these businesses produced service revenue increases of over to million in the increase in service revenues attributable to the acquisitions of barnes morris  regl  hotel partners and jackson cross was approximately million 
the remaining million in revenue growth was attributable primarily to internal growth and expansion of services 
the commercial segment produced ebitda of million in  which was greater than its ebitda 
insignia esg s us operations were led by strong results in the west coast and new york metropolitan areas in the west coast region reported revenues of million for  or more than revenues of million 
this region exhibited strength across all service lines  as virtually all of the growth was from internal sources 
this strength in the west coast region was aided by the launch of brokerage operations in los angeles and san francisco and by adding a tenant representation component to the existing owner services business 
the new york metropolitan area enjoyed another strong year  even though the fourth quarter performance did not reach the record levels achieved in the fourth quarter of service revenues for the new york area were million for compared to million in  reflecting insignia esg s strong presence in this key us market 
in the annual ranking of the top new york deals published in crain s in february  insignia esg accounted for of the top leasing transactions in  equaling the combined total of the number two and three firms 
regl  acquired in february  performed ahead of acquisition date expectations with the production of million of service revenues and ebitda of million for the period of ownership in the foregoing commercial results were achieved in spite of the turmoil in the us capital markets in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a downturn in investment sales activity 
results for the company s investment sales businesses  consisting of insignia capital advisors and hotel partners  fell materially short of management expectations in these businesses produced revenues  in the aggregate  of only million in  which resulted in a negative ebitda  before common support costs of insignia esg  of approximately 
the significance in these results was that all other commercial services  including property management  tenant representation  agency leasing and brokerage  both domestic and international  continued to provide such strong internal growth that overall results were not negatively impacted 
principal investment activities insignia s real estate investment activities produced an ffo increase of from  in to million in this increase was achieved as a result of the continued strategy of purchasing minority equity interests in selected real estate assets in partnership with institutional clients  coupled with operating income growth from existing co investment properties 
during  insignia co invested in the purchase of approximately million square feet of commercial property valued at more than million 
equity earnings from real estate investments reported a loss of million for the difference between real estate ffo and equity earnings represents depreciation of real estate  gains or losses from sales of property and provisions for impairment 
results for reflected real estate depreciation of million  net of gains of approximately  on the sale of property 
residential real estate operations in  residential real estate services were conducted through realty one and insignia residential group 
these businesses produced revenue increases of over to million in this growth was substantially the result of the october acquisition of realty one  which accounted for approximately million  or  of the company s total service revenues for first ohio mortgage  realty one s mortgage loan affiliate  experienced an increase in loan volume of to million in insignia residential group produced revenue increases of over to million in during  insignia residential group expanded its mortgage brokerage activities under which the company arranges financing for cooperative and condominium corporations through third party financial institutions 
in  insignia residential group arranged approximately million of such financing  reflecting an increase of over the residential segment reported ebitda of million for virtually all of the increase over was a result of the october acquisition of realty one 
other items affecting net income administrative costs increased by over to million in these costs consisted entirely of allocations of former parent overhead costs for the periods prior to the spin off and direct costs of the company after the spin off 
interest expense was million in compared to  in the increase was attributable to asset financing consisting of realty one borrowings principally under its warehouse line used in the origination of loans for sale  regl borrowings substantially secured by restricted cash deposits and a non recourse mortgage note financing a real estate acquisition 
the results for and do not include any interest expense allocation from the indebtedness of former parent 
depreciation and amortization  excluding depreciation on real estate properties  increased to million in compared to million in amortization of acquisition intangibles  which reported an increase of or million over  was primarily responsible for this rise 
results for included an impairment charge of million recorded as a write down of the company s investment in insignia cagisa to estimated disposition value 
this write down reflected the company s decision to discontinue and sell its majority interest in its italian subsidiary 
the company completed the sale of its interest in insignia cagisa in march income taxes increased at a greater rate than the rise in income before taxes as a result of the non deductibility of the aforementioned write down together with a  operating loss of insignia cagisa in liquidity and capital resources insignia s liquidity and capital resources consist of its cash on hand  cash provided from operations and available credit under its million revolving credit facility 
unrestricted cash at december  was million  representing a increase over million at december  insignia generated cash flows from operating activities of million for the year  an increase over million in in addition to operating cash flows  the company uses net ebitda and net ebitda less income taxes as measures of liquidity and working capital provided by operations 
the company reported net ebitda of million and million for and  respectively 
net ebitda less income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
these results reflect increases of for net ebitda and for net ebitda less income taxes in over as compared to net income  these net ebitda measures effectively eliminate the impact of non cash charges for depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and other non recurring charges 
management believes that the presentation of such supplemental measures enhance a reader s understanding of the company s operating performance  as they provide a measure of generated cash available for use to service debt and for other required or discretionary purposes 
insignia s total long term debt at december  was approximately million 
such long term debt included approximately million outstanding on its credit facility  notes issued to sellers of acquired businesses of million  a million mortgage warehouse line of credit financing single family mortgages held for sale  mortgage notes of million on wholly owned real estate assets which are non recourse to the company and other debt of subsidiaries totaling million 
in february  insignia raised million through the issuance of perpetual convertible preferred stock to investment funds advised by blackacre capital management 
the preferred stock pays a annual dividend  payable at insignia s option in cash or common stock  and is convertible into the company s common stock at the option of the holder at per share  subject to adjustment 
insignia will utilize this capital for general corporate purposes and to fund ongoing internet initiatives and real estate investing 
in march  insignia completed a million private equity financing through its edificerex subsidiary 
edificerex sold  shares of its series c preferred stock  representing an approximately equity interest in the company  for per share to a group of approximately investors 
following the financing  insignia owns approximately of edificerex  with the remainder owned by management  employees and strategic real estate and operating partners 
insignia expects that its other internally developed internet based businesses will raise third party capital to fund ongoing operations in a similar manner as the edificerex financing 
fluctuations in elements of working capital are partly attributable to the generation of revenues that are transactional in nature and therefore affected by seasonality and capital market conditions 
such fluctuations are generally temporary and minor  with the exception of incentive compensation  because residential operations generally carry minimal receivables and domestic leasing commissions in the commercial sector carry a corresponding commission liability payable to brokers 
incentive compensation is accrued over the course of each year based upon financial performance and generally paid in the first quarter of the succeeding year 
cash flows for capital expenditure requirements  which are not extensive under normal circumstances  generally consist of periodic computer  furniture and fixture replacements incurred in connection with acquisitions or other personnel additions 
during  cash flow utilized to fulfill capital replacement needs of the service businesses totaled over million 
these expenditures in  which the company considers unusually high for its business  consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures from office relocation and expansion  computer equipment and management systems  information technology infrastructure costs and internally developed internet based e commerce capabilities 
over million of the total capital expenditures pertained to leasehold improvements and the development and implementation of a single platform accounting and financial system for the us commercial operations of insignia esg 
in addition  over million in capital expenditures for related to internally developed internet based businesses 
insignia expects capital expenditures to remain at significant levels throughout fiscal due to the continuing development and implementation of such accounting and financial systems at insignia esg and other principal operating units 
property and equipment costs  excluding expenditures for further internet based business initiatives and acquisitions  are expected to again exceed million in insignia expects to use cash on hand and cash flow from operating activities to fund capital expenditures needs  acquisitions including the payment of contingent payments earned  real estate investments  internet initiatives and to make principal payments on the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the company anticipates that its existing sources of liquidity  including cash on hand  operating cash flows and available credit under its revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital replacement needs for the foreseeable future and  in any event  for at least the next twelve months 
the company s working capital needs are reassessed on a routine basis and as acquisitions are identified and pursued 
the year issue the year issue relates to the inability of many computer systems to recognize dates for the year and afterward 
systems that use only two digits to designate a year eg  is entered as can malfunction when dates are used in processing data and recalling data from storage 
the problems arising from such programming came to be known as year or the year issue 
the effects of the year issue on operations and financial reporting could range from minor errors to significant system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including such things as a temporary inability to process transactions  pay invoices or conduct similar routine business operations without interruption 
to address the year issue  insignia established an in house program team and initiated a comprehensive plan to assess  remediate and test the company s internal computer systems  hardware and processes  including key operational and financial systems 
the plan consisted of the following seven key phases awareness  inventory  risk assessment  remediation  quality assurance  implementation and contingency planning 
the plan also included steps to verify that all key customers  suppliers and other third parties with whom the company transacts business were taking the necessary measures to ensure their own readiness and timely implementation 
all phases of the year readiness plan were completed as scheduled prior to the end of to date  insignia has not experienced any year issues with respect to its internal operating systems  customers  suppliers or other third parties 
in addition  insignia has not experienced any material loss in due to the year issue 
as of december   insignia had spent a total of approximately million in connection with addressing the year issue 
these expenditures included the costs of external consultants  internal resources dedicated to achieving year compliance and approximately million in capital expenditures 
all costs  other than those amounts for capital expenditures  were charged to expense as incurred 
all costs of addressing the year issue were funded from operating cash flows and cash on hand 
any additional expenses are expected to be minimal 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  management does not anticipate that its adoption will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
sab discusses the sec staff views on certain revenue recognition transactions 
the company is required to adopt sab no later than the second quarter of and any change in accounting would be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  management has not completed its review of sab and its applicability to the company s business 
the adoption of sab might have a material effect on the financial position and results of operations of the company  however  any change would have no impact on the company s cash flow from operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of operations of insignia in recent years and is not anticipated to have a significant negative impact in the foreseeable future 
insignia s exposure to market risk from changing prices consists primarily of fluctuations in rental rates of properties managed  market interest rates on residential mortgages and debt obligations  real estate property values and foreign currency fluctuations of its european operations 
the revenues associated with the commercial services business are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates  lease rates  real property values and the availability of space and competition in the market place 
commercial service revenues are derived from a broad range of services that are primarily transaction driven and are therefore volatile in nature and highly competitive 
the revenues of the property management operations with respect to rental properties are highly dependent upon the aggregate rents of the properties managed  which are affected by rental rates and building occupancy rates 
rental rate increases are dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environments in the respective locations of the properties 
employee compensation is the principal cost element of property management 
changes in market interest rates on residential mortgage loans and changes in real property values in northern ohio and new york city impact the revenues of the company s residential brokerage and mortgage origination businesses 
recent price and cost trends have not significantly affected profit margins  however  changes in these trends in the future could have a potentially significant adverse impact on the company s profitability 
nature of operations revenues from tenant representation  investment sales  debt placements  agency leasing and residential brokerage  which collectively comprise a substantial portion of insignia s service revenues  are transactional in nature and therefore subject to seasonality and business and capital market conditions 
such seasonal and other factors materially impact the company s quarterly results  particularly revenues  earnings and cash flows 
consistent with the industry in general  the commercial services segment has historically experienced its lowest quarterly operating results in the first quarter of each year as a result of the desire of clients to complete transactions by calendar year end 
this phenomenon generally results in higher revenues and income in the last half of the year and a gradual slowdown in transactional activity and corresponding operating results during the first quarter 
the residential services segment is materially impacted by the seasonal factors of realty one s home brokerage and mortgage origination business 
due to the geographic location of realty one s operations in ohio  weather conditions have historically had an adverse effect on single family home sales resulting in operating losses during the first quarter of each year 
the volume of realty one s home brokerage and mortgage transactions typically peak during the spring and summer months  coinciding with both favorable weather conditions and the increased tendency for moving between school years  resulting in higher revenues and earnings during the second and third quarters of each year 
a significant portion of the expenses associated with transactional activities in the commercial and residential segments is directly correlated to revenue 
as a consequence of the seasonality of revenues  the company s income is normally expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
insignia continues to believes that its large  diversified client base  geographical reach  overall size and number of annual transactions help to minimize the impact of seasonality and other changes in business and capital market conditions on annual revenues and earnings 
market risk and risk management policies insignia is exposed to a variety of market risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the company s operations in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to the united states  the company conducts business in the following foreign jurisdictions united kingdom  germany  italy  belgium and the netherlands 
as a result of these foreign operations  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in these foreign markets 
these foreign factors have not had a material adverse effect on the company and are not expected to have a material impact in the foreseeable future 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to the changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments as well as interest paid on its debt 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
an increase or decrease of in prevailing interest rates at current cash and debt levels would have an estimated annual net impact of approximately million on the company s results of operations
