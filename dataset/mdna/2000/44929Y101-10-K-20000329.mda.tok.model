the company s business tends to be strongest in the second and fourth quarters due to the high level of client sales activity in the spring and prior to the holiday season

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its long term debt obligations 
the fixed rate of on the company s long term debt at december  approximates market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rates swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk the company does not use foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows

management does not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material
