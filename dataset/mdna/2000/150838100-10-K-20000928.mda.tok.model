in may  the company acquired the assets of gerth for million 
gerth is a leading canadian truckload carrier to mexico  with tractors 
this acquisition has strengthened the company s presence in canada and provides additional density in its core north south transport lanes 
effective july   the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of zipp for approximately million 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of zipp s operations from the date of acquisition 
the company believes that zipp will further strengthen its position in the market between the us and mexico as well as within the midwest region 
zipp is a major carrier to and from mexico and also maintains a strong base of business in the midwest 
in calendar year  zipp had million in revenue and an operating ratio of 
at the acquisition date  zipp operated a relatively new fleet of approximately tractors and trailers 
as a result of this acquisition  the company disposed of a group of its own older equipment and related items that were no longer required due to the acquired fleet having newer more fuel efficient equipment

operating income  excluding truckersbb  decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s operating ratio  which expresses operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  excluding truckersbb  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income and the increased operating ratio were attributable to a significant increase in fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  of approximately million  or 
tax effected per diluted common share 
the company has recovered a portion of the increased cost from customers via the use of fuel surcharges 
however  a significant portion of the fuel expense increase was not recovered during fiscal year this is due to several factors the base fuel price levels which determine when surcharges are collected  truck idling  empty miles between freight shipments  and out of route miles caused in part by driver home time needs 
company management continues to meet with customers to explain the significant impact of high fuel prices and to improve the amount and percentage of fuel surcharge reimbursement 
rent and purchased transportation expense increased as a result of growth in owner operator capacity  higher equipment costs  and an increased use of independent mexican carriers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense and operating costs as a percentage of revenue 
truckersbb accounted for a million operating loss for fiscal year this loss was primarily the result of non cash charges related to the fair value of shares of truckersbb common stock earned by its strategic partners 
truckersbb also incurred million of pre tax operating losses for salaries  advertising and other costs associated with the start up of a new business 
those losses were offset by a benefit of million for the company s minority interest in the truckersbb subsidiary 
it is expected that the operating expenses of truckersbb will continue to increase in the near future 
this increase will include anticipated non cash charges to be recognized in connection with the future issuance of shares of truckersbb class a common stock  under agreements with certain o its vendor partners

additional growth in the tractor and trailer fleet beyond the company s existing orders will require additional sources of financing 
seasonality to date  the company s revenues have not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
however  because the company s primary traffic lane is between the midwest united states and mexico  winter generally may have an unfavorable impact upon the company s results of operations 
also  many manufacturers close or curtail their operations during holiday periods  and observe vacation shutdowns  which may impact the company s operations in any particular period 
inflation many of the company s operating expenses  including fuel costs and related fuel taxes  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which result in higher operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s business during the past three years were most significant in fuel 
the company has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and fuel surcharges 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
two amendments to this statement have extended the required implementation date to fiscal years beginning after june  and addressed a limited number of implementation issues 
because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company

jaguar s revenues and expenses are generally recorded in mexican pesos and gerth s revenues and expenses are recorded in united states and canadian dollars 
the company s foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to its foreign currency expenses and the company does not generally engage in currency hedging transactions
