the following discussion and analysis covers the primary factors affecting the corporation s performance and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
all dollar amounts except per share data are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
acquisition on july   the bank completed its acquisition of three bank branches located in meade county  kentucky from bank one  kentucky  na two of the branches are located in brandenburg  kentucky and the third branch is in flaherty  kentucky 
in the transaction  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the acquisition of the meade county banking centers 
the transaction resulted in recording of approximately million of loans and million of deposits 
the net deposits assumed exceeded the cash received by million 
any ratios or analysis comparing years before acquisition may not be comparable 
stock repurchase plan in october the corporation s board of directors authorized the establishment of an additional stock repurchase program pursuant to which of the corporation s outstanding stock may be repurchased from time to time in the open market 
the programs  which began in  have repurchased a total of  shares 
the board will continue to evaluate earnings per share and monitor the success of the repurchase plan to maintain an attractive return to stockholders 
the current plan expires in april  when the board will analyze the bank s capital position and future earnings potential 
results of operations net income was million or per share diluted in compared with million or per share diluted in acquisition related costs in connection with the purchase of three banking centers during the quarter ended september   in the amount of  net of tax were charged against earnings 
also  during the period  the corporation incurred data and computer conversion costs of  net of tax relating to its conversion to a new data processor 
in addition to these expenses  amortization of intangibles increased to  net of tax in from  net of tax in the table on the following page  in millions except per share data  illustrates the net of tax impact of these expenses on earnings and diluted earnings per share june  june  amount per share amount per share income before amortization of intangibles  acquisition and conversion expenses amortization of intangibles acquisition expenses conversion expenses net income net interest income net interest income increased by during to million as compared to million in in spite of a declining net interest margin 
the bank s net interest margin declined to for the year ended june  compared to for the period 
this decline in net interest margin can be largely attributed to the rise in certificate of deposit rates on specials offered by the bank over the past eight months 
to maintain a customer base in the midst of fierce rate competition  the bank offered both short and long term certificate specials to retain maturing accounts renewing at much lower rates 
these promotions were also necessary to assist in funding the loan growth in the bank driven by the transition to a sales culture for retail associates 
home equity lines of credit at low introductory rates were also a focus of the retail promotions for increasing loan relationships with our home mortgage portfolio customers 
for the short term  these introductory rates contributed to the margin declines 
if interest rates continue to increase  the bank s margin may continue to narrow 
maintaining a growth in net interest margin will only be achieved by increasing the current lending practices of focusing on commercial and consumer lending 
in order to offset the narrowing margin  the bank developed a dealer loan program in our meade county banking center that would serve all the areas of operation for the bank 
the program is producing a large volume of consumer loans at higher yields than our mortgage portfolio 
at june   total loans under the dealer loan program totaled million 
a commercial loan program composed of shorter term fixed and variable rate loans is responsible for much of the bank s loan growth and enables management to more effectively manage rate risk during the rising rate environment 
realizing that both these programs represent products with added credit risk  the bank has in place loan processing review procedures to monitor loan underwriting and documentation 
a formal process of application presentation to the executive loan committee has been developed to insure compliance with lending policies 
monthly reporting requirements and internal auditing practices have been developed to provide additional control over delinquencies and foreclosures  which to date have continued to be minimal 
average interest earning assets increased by million from million for the period to million for the period due to the growth of the bank s loan portfolio 
average loans  which comprise of the total interest earning assets  were million higher and averaged million during  while the average yield on loans decreased by basis points to average interest bearing liabilities increased by million to an average balance of million for customer deposits averaged million during  a million increase from the average balance of million 
average federal home loan bank advances increased million for the period to fund the bank s increased lending activity that exceeded its deposit growth 
this same lending growth will impact the level of future bank investments that will be decreasing in balance in the near future  given the need for all deposit dollars to fund lending activity 
the bank s cost of funds averaged during which was an increase of basis points from the average cost of funds of due to higher rates paid on short term customer deposits 
provision for loan losses management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and other factors 
the provision for loan losses was for as compared to for net charge offs were during as compared to during the bank s allowance for loan losses was million or

beyond compensation and benefits  office occupancy and equipment expenses increased by in compared to due to the opening of an additional in store facility  remodeling an existing office  and installing three new atm machines 
all other expenses increased by in compared to including postage  telephone  data processing  supplies and customer account expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the bank is required to maintain minimum specific levels of liquid assets as defined by the office of thrift supervision s regulations 
this requirement is based on a percentage of cash and eligible investments to deposits and short term borrowings and is currently 
at june   the bank s liquid assets were of its liquidity base 
the bank s primary source of funds for meeting its liquidity needs are customer deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank  principal and interest payments from loans and mortgage backed securities  and earnings from operations retained by the bank 
loan demand continued to be strong during the fiscal year ended june   as net loans increased from million at june   to million at june   an growth rate 
the increase in lending was primarily attributable to a newly developed dealer loan program  which totaled million at june  and an increase in the bank s commercial loan portfolio  which increased by million for the bank intends to continue to fund loan growth outstanding loan commitments were million at june  with customer deposits and additional advances from the fhlb 
at june   the bank had an unused approved line of credit in the amount of million and sufficient collateral to borrow an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
the office of thrift supervision s capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three capital standards a tier i leverage ratio  a tier i capital ratio  and an risk based capital standard 
as of june   the bank s actual capital percentages for tier i leverage of  tier i capital of  and current risk based capital of  significantly exceed the regulatory requirement for each category 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the bank s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
comparison of fiscal to net income for the fiscal year ended june   was million or per share diluted as compared to net income of million or per share diluted for the same period in acquisition related costs in connection with the purchase of three banking centers during the quarter ended september   in the amount of  net of tax were charged against earnings 
also  the corporation incurred data and computer conversion costs of  net of tax relating to its conversion to a new data processor 
in addition to these expenses  amortization of intangibles increased to  net of tax in from  net of tax in excluding these acquisition and conversion costs and amortization of intangibles  net earnings for the period would have increased approximately to million or per share diluted for the fiscal year ended june  from million or per share diluted for the fiscal year ending june  total interest income increased by million from fiscal to due to the strong growth of the bank s loan portfolio and the interest earning assets acquired from the three meade county banking centers 
interest income on loans accounts for the majority of the bank s interest income as average loan balances  which comprise of the total interest earning assets  were million during as compared to million during  or an increase of million 
the average yield on loans decreased by basis points to during as compared to during total interest expense increased by million from fiscal to the weighted average interest rate paid on customer deposits averaged during  which was a decrease of basis points from the average cost of funds of 
the decrease was attributable to lower rates paid on short term customer deposits 
customer deposit balances averaged million during  a million increase from the average balance of million 
the acquisition contributed approximately million to the total deposit growth 
as a result of the foregoing discussion  net interest income increased by million to million in from million in in spite of the declining net interest margin 
the bank s net interest margin declined to for the year ended june  compared to for the period 
the acquisition contributed approximately million to the total increase in net interest income for the period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  the bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee aloc 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies of the corporation  which include managing the sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the corporation s alco is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the corporation s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the corporation s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
the table  presented on page  under item regulatory capital requirements  presents the corporation s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of june  all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are held to maturity or available for sale 
the corporation has no trading securities 
npv is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines estimated by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of june   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the npv 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent one of the corporation s primary loan products  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the corporation s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the npv 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of interest rate increases 
another tool of evaluating the institution s sensitivity to net interest income to changes in interest rates is to examine the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
the following interest rate sensitivity table sets forth the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at june   which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis as of june  dollars in thousands over months months years years total interest earning assets loans      securities      total rate sensitive assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings      time deposits      borrowed funds   total rate sensitive liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as the preceding table indicates  the bank has a negative cumulative gap for assets and liabilities maturing or repricing within one year in the amount of  million or of total assets 
thus  decreases in interest rates during this time period would generally increase net interest income  while increases in interest rates would generally decrease net interest income 
however  even though the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
gap analysis does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree and  therefore  does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
additionally  certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features  which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and decay rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to afford the payments on their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
