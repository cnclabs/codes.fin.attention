item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading packager and distributor of industrial  medical and specialty gases  welding equipment and supplies  and propane in eleven states in the mid atlantic and midwestern regions of the united states 
the company s net sales have grown  primarily as a result of acquisitions  at a compound annual rate of approximately per year since the company started business in  increasing from  in that year to million in fiscal in fiscal  gases accounted for approximately of net sales  welding equipment and supplies accounted for approximately of net sales  and cylinder and tank rental accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company believes it has been successful in executing its strategy of growth through acquisitions  having completed acquisitions since some acquisitions have had  and the company expects some future acquisitions will have  a dilutive effect upon the company s income from operations and net income before tax for a short period following consummation 
this temporary dilution occurs because some of the benefits of acquisitions  such as leveraging of operating and administrative expenses  improved product gross margins and real sales growth  occur over a period ranging from two to eight quarters  depending upon the complexity of integrating each acquisition into the company s existing operations 
the consideration for most acquisitions includes a combination of a cash payment at closing  seller financing and payments under covenants not to compete and consulting agreements 
in most cases  operating cash flow of an acquired business is positive in a relatively short period of time 
for many acquisitions  the company believes that projections of future cash flows justify payment of amounts in excess of the book or market value of the assets acquired  resulting in goodwill being recorded 
the company s results are subject to moderate seasonality  primarily due to fluctuations in the demand for propane  which is highest during winter months falling in the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
seasonality of total sales has increased as propane sales as a percentage of total sales have increased 
operating and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries  benefits  transportation equipment operating costs  facility lease expenses and general office expenses 
these expenses are generally fixed on a quarter to quarter basis 
the company believes that changes in these expenses as a percentage of sales should be evaluated over the long term rather than on a quarter to quarter basis due to the moderate seasonality of sales mentioned above and the generally fixed nature of these expenses 
historically  the company s gross profit margins as a percentage of sales have been higher on the sale of gases than on the sale of welding equipment and supplies hard goods 
as a result of recent acquisitions of some distributors with a higher proportion of hard goods to gas sales  the company s average gross profit as a percentage of sales has decreased in comparison to prior years 
future acquisitions may affect this pattern depending upon the product mix of the acquired businesses 
effective july   the company changed its estimate of the useful lives of its cylinders and tanks from to years 
this change was made to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service 
the change had the effect of reducing depreciation expense in by approximately million and increasing net earnings by million or 
per share

at june   the company had working capital of approximately million 
funds provided by operations for the twelve months ended june  were approximately million

on may   the company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with bank one  as agent 
this agreement increased the maximum revolving note borrowings to million  from the previous maximum borrowings level of million  and extended the maturity of the revolving note to april  the agreement permits the company  on an annual basis  to request that the maturity be extended one year 
no significant changes were made to pricing and the covenant requirements when compared to the original agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for substantially all of the borrowings under the credit facility was as of june  as of june   availability under the revolving loan was approximately million  with outstanding borrowings of approximately million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
the credit facility is secured by all of the company s assets 
the revolving loan is used primarily to fund acquisitions 
the company is not required to make principal payments on outstanding balances of the revolving loan as long as certain covenants are satisfied 
interest is charged on both the term loan and the revolving loan at either the lender s prime rate or various libor rates  at the company s discretion  plus an applicable spread 
the loan agreement for the credit facility contains various financial covenants applicable to the company  including covenants requiring minimum fixed charge coverage  maximum funded debt to ebitda  and minimum net worth 
the company is in compliance with these covenants and believes that it will continue to be in compliance through at least the next twelve months 
the company is obligated under various promissory notes related to the financing of acquisitions that have various rates of interest  ranging from to per annum  and maturities through the outstanding balance of these notes as of june  was million 
some of these notes are secured by assets related to the applicable acquisition  some are unsecured  and some are backed by bank letters of credit issued under the company s credit facility 
the company enters into contractual agreements in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce interest rate risks and costs inherent in the company s debt portfolio 
the company enters into these agreements to change the fixed variable interest rate mix of the debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable debt within certain parameters set by management

the company has previously entered into a put call option agreement with an independent distributor for the purchase of its business 
this option becomes exercisable beginning in the year and ending in the year the company believes that it will have adequate capital resources available to fund this acquisition at such time that the option is exercised 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  borrowing availability under its credit facility and the ability to obtain financing with sellers of businesses will be sufficient to satisfy the company s requirements for operating funds  capital expenditures and future acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
the company has no plans at this time to issue additional shares of common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company generally has experienced higher sales activity during its second and third quarters as a result of seasonal sales of propane  with corresponding lower sales for the first and fourth quarters 
as a result  income from operations and net income typically are higher for the second and third quarters than for the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
the timing of acquisitions may also have an appreciable effect on quarter to quarter earnings 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally low rates of inflation in the economy and the company s historical ability to pass purchase price increases to its customers in the form of sales price increases 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
subsequent events on september   the company acquired the assets of titan welding supply  ltd  a welding supply distributor having approximately million in annualized sales 
the acquisition was financed through the company s credit facility and notes with the sellers
