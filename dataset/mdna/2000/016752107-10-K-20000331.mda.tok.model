results of operations 
s 
net earned premium revenues of the company were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while earned premiums declined in all lines of business  the most significant reductions during were in assigned risk automobile million  voluntary private passenger automobile million and commercial package policies million 
as a result of poor operating results  the company is no longer entering into new assigned risk contracts 
effective january   all policy renewal obligations have been assigned to another insurance company 
however  the company remains liable for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that occurred during the policy term 
the company believes it has provided adequate reserves for such liabilities  including loss adjustment expenses 
the decline in voluntary private passenger automobile resulted from tighter underwriting standards  increased competition and the company s decision to no longer accept new policies from those agents who historically have had poor underwriting results 
the company s termination of certain unprofitable agents has also adversely affected premium volume in other lines of business 
in  the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pool million and a reduction in certain lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile million  private passenger automobile million  commercial package policies million and workers compensation million  due to tighter underwriting standards  re underwriting and increased competition 
the company s combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows years ended december  gaap sap 
s 
the company s combined ratios increased in and primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs 
in addition  the reduction in servicing fees negatively affected the expense ratios 
expense ratios were also adversely affected by increased expenditures related to the installation of new information systems  providing internet access to agents and severance costs 
included in the company s results for  and were million  million and million  respectively  for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years 
during  the company experienced unfavorable development due to an increase in severity of accident year losses in the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines  and accident year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line 
as a result  the company increased its reserves by million for assigned risk automobile  million for voluntary private passenger automobile and million for commercial automobile lines 
as previously discussed  the company no longer accepts new policies from certain agents identified as having had poor underwriting results in the voluntary private passenger automobile line of business and  effective january   the company no longer participates in the assigned risk business 
additionally  the company no longer offers insurance in those classes of the commercial automobile line that contributed to the unfavorable development 
during  the company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  focusing on workers compensation  commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business 
as part of the review  substantially all open workers compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including additionally  during  the company reorganized the commercial auto claims department 
as part of this realignment  more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised 
accordingly  reserves were strengthened by million for workers compensation  million for commercial automobile and million for other commercial liability lines of business 
the reserve strengthening included million for commercial package lines of business and million for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business 
these increases resulted from a review of open claim files and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses  particularly the through accident years 
as a consequence of its reserve increases  the company has reduced premiums and pre tax profits to recognize reinsurance premiums due for and prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements 
such amounts totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has not entered into retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements after for the lines of business discussed above  as well as all other property and casualty lines of business  the company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  statistical analyses and case basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses 
the actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns 
these estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience 
any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses  including those discussed above  is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified 
the reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the probable effects of current developments  trends and other relevant matters are also considered 
since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control or are affected by future conditions  reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  the company s estimates and judgments may be revised 
while the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations  the company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
in management s judgment  information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the company s loss reserves 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis  incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience  and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate 
investment income has decreased by approximately million or in as compared to a decrease of million  or in  primarily as a result of lower invested assets due to a decrease in premiums written and a program to reduce pending claims 
during  the company had realized capital losses of million principally due to the sale of fixed maturities to satisfy operating cash needs 
during  the company had realized capital gains of million principally from gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturities  primarily us treasury notes 
during  the company recorded million in realized capital losses in the normal course of managing its investment strategy 
the combination of other underwriting expenses incurred and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflected a decrease of million in or and an increase of approximately million or in the decrease in primarily related to the decline in premium revenue coupled with a reduction in operating expenses 
the increase in was largely the result of expenses relating to the move of the company s executive and administrative offices to brooklyn  new york and higher underwriting costs relating to surveys and audits of insureds records in connection with the company s re underwriting efforts offset in part by a million pension curtailment gain 
the decrease in was primarily the result of lower operating costs  primarily relating to pension and severance benefits for certain employees  and a decrease in the provision for servicing carriers expenses in connection with the nypap  offset by higher systems costs 

s 
impact of inflation 
s 
the company  as well as the property and casualty insurance industry in general  is affected by inflation 
with respect to losses  the company s claim severity is affected by the impact of inflation on the cost of automobile repair parts  medical costs and lost wages 
the costs of adjusting claims and other underwriting expenses have also been affected by inflationary pressures on salaries and employee benefits 
the company receives rate increases based in part upon its experience as well as the industry s experience 
accordingly  premium increases generally follow the rate of inflation
