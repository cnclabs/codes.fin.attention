management outlook the mid scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely competitive 
improvements in future operating performance will be primarily dependent upon the company s ability to increase comparable sales  especially given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at existing restaurants 
cost controls will also play a significant factor in future profit growth 
in addition  numerous external factors could have a significant impact on future performance  including  but not limited to  food costs  labor availability  site availability  the economy  weather and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  mandated benefits and taxes 
historically  the company has mitigated the effects of inflation through cost controls and periodic price increases 
management believes it will be able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures  although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints and other business considerations
