to date  neurocrine has not generated any revenues from the sale of products  and does not expect to generate any product revenues for the foreseeable future 
revenues are expected to come from the company s strategic alliances 
neurocrine has incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million as of december  and expects to incur additional operating losses in the future  which may be potentially greater than losses in prior years 
since inception  neurocrine has primarily financed its operations through proceeds received from the sale of its common stock in various private and public offerings  as well as revenues received under corporate collaborations 
the company operates in a single business segment and has no foreign operations

revenues in for sponsored research and development funding and milestone achievements under these and the novartis agreements were higher than those recorded in by million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses increased to million during compared with million in and million in increased expenses reflect advancement of the company s drug candidates through progressive clinical development phases 
the company expects to incur significant increases in future periods as later phases of development typically involve an increase in the scope of studies and number of patients treated

ltd taisho providing taisho an option to obtain european and asian commercialization rights for neurocrine s altered peptide ligand apl for diabetes nbi 
neurocrine would retain all rights in the rest of the world  including north america 
in september  the company signed an amendment to its agreement with janssen pharmaceutica  nv janssen 
the amendment provides for a new sponsored research period designed to identify new corticotropin releasing factor crf receptor antagonists which will be subject to the terms of the original agreement signed in the term of the amendment is from april through february under the agreement  the company will receive million in sponsored research funding  up to million in milestone achievements   for research already conducted under this certain technology and reimbursement of all outside and third party costs associated with the project 
as of december   the company has received million in sponsored research and the  payment for prior research 
in march  the company entered into an agreement with wyeth ayerst laboratories  the pharmaceutical division of american home products corporation  on the research  development and commercialization of compounds  which modulate eaats for the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases 
the wyeth ayerst agreement  valued at up to million if a product is commercialized  includes sharing proprietary technologies  funding for research  payments for milestones reached  plus royalties on sales from products resulting from the collaboration 
under the terms of the agreement  neurocrine expects to receive three to five years of funding for research and development as well as worldwide royalties on commercial sales of products that result from the collaboration 
wyeth ayerst will also provide neurocrine with access to chemical libraries for screening within the collaborative field 
as of december   the company has received million in sponsored research payments and million for the achievement of four milestones 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with interest income and future payments due under the strategic alliances  will be sufficient to satisfy its current and projected funding requirements at least through the year however  no assurance can be given that such capital resources and payments will be sufficient to conduct its research and development programs as planned 
the amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs 
neurocrine will require additional funding for the continuation of its research and product development programs  for progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals for its product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  the cost of product in licensing and any possible acquisitions  and may require additional funding for establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
the company may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
the company may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms  potentially including off balance sheet financing 
there can be no assurance that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly one or more of its research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others 
this may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates 
neurocrine expects to incur operating losses over the next several years as its research  development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities increase 
to the extent that the company is unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  the company expects that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s products under development will be successfully developed or that its products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable the company to earn a profit 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates its long term debt 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
during  the company partially financed the purchase of land under a year note payable for approximately  which bears interest at a floating rate of prime plus one quarter percent and at december  and  respectively 
the note is repayable in equal monthly installments beginning february at december   the balance of the note was  the repayment schedule for the note is  for each year through and  in the year the company believes that a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially effect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments nor the costs associated with the long term debt 
impact of year beginning in  the company conducted a program to address the impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by our computer systems and software it systems  embedded systems in our non computer equipment non it systems and relationships with certain third parties 
assessment  testing  and remediation of the company s critical systems were completed in mid october based on survey responses and year website statements  the company also assessed year readiness of third parties with which it has significant relationships 
contingency plans were formulated for each of the company s critical systems and third party relationships  which were deficient in compliance criteria 
the total costs  both out of pocket and internal  of the company s year program were estimated at  and were funded with available cash 
there are no further costs anticipated 
other internal systems projects were not significantly deferred as a result of the year readiness program  because much of the year assessment and remediation efforts were integrated into the company s routine maintenance and upgrade programs 
to date  there have been no material adverse effects caused by the january  date change on the company s it and non it systems  third party relationships  nor its results of operations 
caution on forward looking statements the company s business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in its research and development activities  including the successful continuation of the company s strategic collaborations  the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing its own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change and competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if the company s product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties
