in september  we announced a program to restructure our business to fully concentrate on our precision linear and mixed signal positions in the analog  internet  and magnetic storage markets 
the program forecasted a workforce reduction of to employees and restructuring and other charges of up to million 
in january  we subsequently indicated that these charges might exceed million 
we indicated in an announcement in september that the timing of recording the restructuring charges was uncertain and dependent upon a number of different factors  including negotiations related to our joint ventures 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  of which charges to cost of sales included million related to asset impairment see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  million related to wafer purchase commitment charges see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and million related to inventory write downs see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we recorded charges of million related to severance and related benefits along with facilities scale back and other costs in restructuring costs and other  net see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we substantially completed the restructuring activities which were initiated in the second quarter of fiscal we restructured our relationships with our manufacturing joint ventures and returned to the fabless business model we had used previously 
as part of the first quarter restructuring  we recorded charges of million in restructuring costs  million of which is in cost of sales 
these restructuring charges included a million direct cash payment to one of the joint venture partners  million related to certain cirrus common stock which we issued to one of the joint venture partners  million of lease buyout costs and million of equipment write offs 
these charges were partially offset by the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued wafer purchase commitment charges due to the renegotiated terms of our purchase commitments with our former partners 
net sales net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of from million in fiscal revenues in fiscal and included amounts from businesses which have been divested by us and are included in our end of life business group 
revenues from divested businesses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal net sales from the core businesses in fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal sales of core products decreased during fiscal primarily due to reduced volumes in the magnetic storage business partially offset by increased volumes in the analog and internet business groups 
average selling prices declined in fiscal net sales in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal  excluding revenues from divested businesses and million of revenues from patent cross license agreements in fiscal  largely due to decreased sales in mass storage products  primarily related to decreased unit volumes and average selling prices of read channel devices and controllers which were offset by increased sales in audio products  primarily related to increased unit volume 
export sales  principally to asia  include sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas and were approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal export sales to the pacific rim excluding japan were  and of net sales  to japan were  and of net sales  and to europe and to the rest of the world were  and of net sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
our sales are currently denominated primarily in us dollars 
from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge certain of our foreign currency exposures related to sales and balance sheet accounts denominated in yen 
we have not experienced any significant losses related to our foreign exchange activity 
sales to western digital accounted for more than of net sales in fiscal two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively of net sales in fiscal two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively of net sales in fiscal no other customers accounted for or more of net sales in fiscal  or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in such a customer s orders could have an adverse effect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was impacted by declining average selling prices in the audio  magnetic and optical storage businesses 
this was partially offset by lower production costs in the audio and magnetic storage units 
additionally  our sales mix in fiscal shifted toward lower margin analog business group products 
overall  we expect gross margins in the near term to improve slightly as we ramp production volume on higher margin products in the internet business group and integrated disk drive products from the ci product family 
gross margin for fiscal was negative 
included in gross margin for fiscal was million related to the write off of both micrus and cirent joint venture assets which were deemed to be impaired in fiscal based upon an assessment that future cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  million of charges related to excess wafer purchase commitments for micrus and cirent  and million of inventory write downs associated with products related to businesses being phased out 
during fiscal  we assessed our manufacturing capacity needs and evaluated the carrying value of the assets recorded in connection with both the micrus and cirent joint ventures 
this evaluation was necessitated by the restructuring of our operations  along with the future expected decreases in sales  gross margins and cash flows from the manufacture and sale of our products produced by the joint ventures which resulted in excess manufacturing capacity 
expected undiscounted future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
therefore  an impairment loss of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated using expected discounted cash flows for both micrus and cirent 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin was in fiscal the gross margin percentage in fiscal was primarily a result of improved margins in mass storage due to a change in mix within the mass storage products towards read channel products  an overall change in product mix within the company towards mass storage products and million of patent cross license revenues in the fourth quarter which had no corresponding cost of sales 
these improvements were offset by lower margins in pc products and million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter related to wafer purchase commitments for micrus and cirent 
the lower margins in pc products were primarily related to declining average selling prices on graphics and modem products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily due to lower headcounts related to the fiscal restructuring efforts to focus research and development on our precision linear and mixed signal positions in the analog  internet  and magnetic storage markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales represented approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense attributable to our efforts to collect accounts receivable  a decrease in the allowance for bad debts and restructuring activities during fiscal which included the divestiture of several non core businesses and headcount reductions made in order for the support structure to be in line with our current business model 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets in fiscal includes million relating to the recovery of a holdback from the fiscal sale of the infrastructure product group of our pacific communication sciences  inc pcsi subsidiary to adc telecommunications  inc during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our nuera communications  inc subsidiary for cash proceeds of approximately million million net of million of nuera s own cash and recorded a gain of approximately million 
gain on sale of assets also includes the reversal of million that had previously been accrued for losses on facilities commitments in connection with the sale and shut down of the operating divisions of pcsi in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring costs and other  net during the first quarter of fiscal  we substantially completed the restructuring activities that were initiated in the second quarter of fiscal we restructured our relationships with our manufacturing joint ventures and returned to a fabless business model 
as part of the first quarter restructuring  we recorded charges of million in restructuring costs  million of which is in cost of sales 
these restructuring charges included a million direct cash payment to one of the joint venture partners  million related to certain cirrus common stock which we issued to one of the joint venture partners  million of lease buyout costs and million of equipment write offs 
these charges were partially offset with the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued wafer purchase commitment charges due to the renegotiated terms of our purchase commitments with our former partners 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we commenced certain activities related to our previously announced restructuring and recorded charges in the second quarter of fiscal related to those activities 
these actions included an immediate workforce reduction along with write downs and write offs of obsolete inventory  equipment and facilities 
in connection with these actions  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million consisting of million for workforce reductions  million for write downs or write offs of equipment  intangibles and other assets  million for facility commitments net of million reversal of previously accrued losses on facilities in connection with the third quarter fiscal discontinuation of certain product development efforts in graphics products  and the remaining amount representing other committed liabilities and expenses 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we continued with our restructuring activities previously announced in the second quarter of fiscal and recorded additional charges of million 
our restructuring activities for the third quarter of fiscal included the divestiture of non core businesses and the outsourcing of the fremont manufacturing test floor 
in connection with these actions  we recorded charges consisting of million for work force reductions  million for write downs and write offs of equipment and other assets relating to the fremont manufacturing test floor  and the remaining amount representing other committed liabilities and expenses 
we continued with the restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal these activities resulted in million of charges which primarily consisted of million write off of the equity investment in micrus  million loss on the sale of the modem and communications businesses and million of write offs of fixed assets and net gain on sale of assets in connection with our business divestiture 
restructuring costs and other  net for fiscal included total restructuring charges of million and million for write downs and write offs of property and equipment 
as of march  we have a remaining restructuring accrual of million of which we expect to discharge approximately million in fiscal through cash payments 
we recorded restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with a discontinuation of certain strategies and product development efforts in the graphics product group of our pc products division 
this resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately positions 
the primary components of the restructuring charge were million related to excess assets and facility leases and million of severance payments that were made during fiscal restructuring costs and other also includes a million reversal of amounts that had been previously accrued for losses on facilities in connection with the april restructuring and other costs of million representing additional compensation costs in connection with the same restructuring that were earned and recorded in the third quarter of fiscal as of march   activities related to the fiscal restructuring of our graphics product group were completed 
acquired in process research development expenses during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded million or of net sales of acquired in process research and development expenses resulting from our acquisition of audiologic  inc which was supported by an independent appraisal see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expensed these amounts on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
we can give no assurance that acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future will not result in substantial charges for acquired in process research and development that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
the in process research and development relates to the highest performance  all digital pulse width modulation pwm technology for amplification of next generation audio systems 
audiologic s technology will provide solutions for virtually all audio applications at to times better power efficiency than alternative power amplifier and digital signal processing methods 
the in process research and development is comprised of three significant pwm development projects  and b 
we periodically review the stage of completion and likelihood of success of each of the in process research and development projects 
the current status of the in process research and development projects are as follows pwm the main applications for this product are low end consumer audio products  notebook computer speakers and headphones 
this product is a low power consumer 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately eight months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of the pwm technology is expected to be approximately million 
pwm this product will supply the pc speaker  after market automotive  high end consumer audio and shelf top audio system markets 
this product is a medium power consumer 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of the pwm technology is expected to be approximately million 
pwm b the applications for this product are high power mass market consumer and high volume professional audio products 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of the pwm b technology is expected to be approximately million 
these products are currently in the design stage of the development cycle 
we believe the associated risks of developing these products into commercially viable products will be our ability to perform further research and development to determine technological feasibility in light of competing solutions and the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
value assigned to in process research and development we assigned value to the in process research and development projects by calculating the estimated stage of completion expressed as a percentage of completion for each project  applying the percentage to the expected net cash flows for each project  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
we determined the stage of completion by analyzing the costs incurred as of the valuation date divided by the total estimated costs to complete the projects 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us 
the rates we utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are based on audiologic s weighted average rate of return 
given the nature of the risks associated with the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility and the size of audiologic the weighted average rate of return was adjusted 
based on these factors  a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for audiologic 
the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variance may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
with respect to the acquired in process technologies  the calculations of value were adjusted to reflect the value creation efforts of audiologic prior to the acquisition 
following are the estimated completion percentages and technology lives estimated expected percentage useful product of completion life pwm years pwm years pwm b years the value assigned to each acquired in process research and development project as of the acquisition date were as follows in thousands value product assigned pwm  pwm  pwm b other the terms of the audiologic purchase agreement provide for additional cash or stock consideration to the extent that our stock price calculated as a ten day average does not exceed per share on the one year anniversary of the closing  july  such additional consideration would be valued at approximately million as of april  because the ten day average stock price on that date was 
we expect to capitalize such costs  if any are incurred  as additional consideration for the purchase of the company 
abandonment of assets charge during fiscal  we made a strategic decision to abandon the development efforts previously undertaken on the manufacturing component of our enterprise resource planning software 
in connection with this decision  we recorded an asset abandonment charge of approximately million 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the reduction in capital leases from the fiscal restructuring activities 
interest income interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income in fiscal declined from fiscal due to cash payments required in connection with the restructuring activities in the first quarter 
this was partially offset by cash inflows later in the year from the liquidation of certain investments 
interest income decreased in fiscal over fiscal as a result of the reduction in cash balance primarily due to stock repurchase activities and cash used by operations in fiscal realized gains on the sale of marketable equity securities we realized gains of million in fiscal due to sales of stock and associated options we sold in phone 
com  inc nasdaq phcm 
we also realized a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the sale of our interest in ambient technologies to intel corporation 
other income other income for fiscal includes million from the release of a wafer purchase accrual previously established in connection with the sale of a technology license due to lower wafer demand than was previously forecasted 
also included in other income is a million reduction of a liability associated with our stock issued as part of the divestiture of the micrus manufacturing joint venture 
other income for fiscal includes gains on the disposal of certain equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains 
in fiscal  other income expense  net  includes gains on the disposal of certain equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains  which were partially offset by certain legal settlements 
income taxes we recognized no income tax benefit for fiscal losses because of current operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards from statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we have provided a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the tax provision for fiscal primarily resulted from million of deferred income tax expense recorded as a valuation allowance to offset net deferred tax assets which had been recognized as of march  the effective tax rate for fiscal was equal to the us federal statutory rate and state income taxes offset by federal and state research tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we used million of cash from our operating activities as opposed to using million and generating million of cash from operating activities during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily due to a net loss of million excluding gains from the sale of securities of million combined with a million reduction in accounts payable 
the fiscal decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the net loss of million realized in fiscal  million of which was related to non cash transactions unique to fiscal the remaining decrease related to an increase in payments during the year for accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by lower collections of accounts receivable due to the decrease in sales during fiscal cash provided from operations in fiscal was due to improved accounts receivable and inventory turnover  funding received for equipment and leasehold advances to the joint ventures and positive net income 
included in net income from operations in fiscal was million of patent cross license revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable 
we generated million from investing activities in fiscal compared with using cash of million and million in investing activities during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  we sold million of short term investments to fund operations and for restructuring commitments 
we also sold approximately two thirds of our holdings in the common stock of phone 
com  and our interest in ambient technologies for a combined million 
in addition  we sold our interest in the cirent manufacturing facility for million 
additionally  the release of million of restricted cash due to reduced lease commitments provided additional funding 
these increases were partially offset by investments of million into new equipment  software and the erp system 
cash used by investing activities for was similar with the fiscal amount as the proceeds from the sale of assets and termination of the umc agreement were offset by the manufacturing agreement and investment payments during the year to the joint ventures in fiscal part of the fiscal increase in cash was due to a higher percentage of our investments in securities with original maturities less than ninety days than in the prior fiscal year 
as a result  short term investments generated a net cash flow of million during the fiscal year 
in addition  during fiscal we received approximately million from the termination of the umc agreements  and approximately million from the sale of nuera proceeds of million less nuera s own cash of million 
net cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we used cash for financing activities in fiscal for payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations which was partially offset by cash provided from employee stock option exercises 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal was primarily due to our repurchase of million worth of treasury stock 
the cash used in fiscal was primarily due to payments on our outstanding lease obligations and debt 
as of march   we are contingently liable as guarantor or co guarantor for equipment leases of micrus which have remaining payments of approximately million due through calendar year compared to million of remaining payments for equipment leases of micrus and cirent as of march  the decrease is because of lease payments and our release from guaranty responsibilities for cirent leases 
as of march   we have a bank line of credit providing a commitment for letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate of million  which expires on june  the letters of credit are collateralized by cash or securities with interest at the higher of a 
per annum above the latest federal funds rate as defined in the second amended credit agreement  or b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the bank 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under the bank line of credit 
we expect to amend or replace the existing line of credit facility in fiscal we do not believe the amendment of our line of credit will have an impact on our financial position or on our ability to finance our operations for the foreseeable future 
as of march   we had approximately million outstanding letters of credit and an additional million available under this line of credit 
these letters of credit are secured by cash and securities of million  which are recorded as restricted cash 
of these amounts  million is used to support equipment lease agreements of the micrus facility 
the letters of credit to support these amounts will expire and the funds will no longer be restricted upon termination of the underlying lease agreements 
ibm has agreed to use its best efforts to effect such a termination by march  or replace our guarantee 
although we can not assure that we will be able to generate cash in the future  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations for the foreseeable future 
factors that may affect future operating results we have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations may continue in future periods 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include 
the volume and timing of orders received  
changes in the mix of our products sold  
market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  
competitive pricing pressures  
our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand  
our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  
fixed costs associated with minimum purchase commitments under supply contracts if demand decreases  
the timing and extent of our research and development expenses  
cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  
the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  
fluctuations in manufacturing costs  
disruption in the supply of wafers or assembly services  
the ability of customers to make payments to us  
increases in material costs  
certain production and other risks associated with using independent manufacturers  and 
product obsolescence  price erosion and other competitive factors 
historically in the integrated circuit industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
in addition  because of fixed costs in the integrated circuit industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new precision linear and mixed signal circuits for new and existing markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner  and to have such products gain market acceptance 
the development of new precision linear and mixed signal circuits is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including 
proper new product definition  
timely completion of design and testing of new products  
achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields and 
market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers 
although we seek to design products that have the potential to become industry standard products  we cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by such market leaders  or that any products initially accepted by our customers that are market leaders will become industry standard products 
both revenues and margins may be materially affected if new product introductions are delayed or if our products are not designed into successive generations of our customers products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could harm our business and operating results 
successful product design and development is dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified design engineers  of which there is a limited number 
due to the complexity and variety of precision linear and mixed signal circuits  the limited number of qualified circuit designers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of such circuits  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
product development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on the integration of functionality on individual devices 
there is a general trend towards increasingly complex products 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of our products increase the risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by our customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
this could result in 
material recall and replacement costs for product warranty and support  
our customer relationships could also be adversely impacted by the recurrence of significant defects  
delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance  and 
diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
the occurrence of any of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
in addition  any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
the integrated circuit industry is very cyclical and an industry downturn would adversely affect our business 
the integrated circuit industry is characterized by 
rapid technological change  
cyclical market patterns  
significant price erosion  
periods of over capacity and production shortages  
variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and 
significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
although the semiconductor industry in recent periods has experienced increased demand and production capacity constraints  we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any future downturn in the industry will not be severe or that any such downturn will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating costs due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
any downturn in the markets we serve would harm our business 
a majority of our products are incorporated into products such as personal computers  mass storage  audio and industrial electronics  and embedded processor products 
these markets may from time to time experience cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
such industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
our business would be harmed by any future downturns in the markets that we serve 
the following sections detail the risks associated with serving these various markets there are risks associated with our dependence on the pc market 
the following are risks associated with our involvement in the pc markets 
greatly pronounced demand fluctuations characteristic of our role as a component supplier to pc original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to peripheral device manufacturers  
our involvement in the consumer pc market  the most volatile segment of the pc market  
increased competition from other ic makers  including intel corporation  who plan to incorporate features into or with their microprocessor products which replicate those of our products  
loss of customer base as we refocus on non pc markets  and 
as a supplier to manufacturers at different levels of the production chain  our potential dependence on the success of a particular pc oem due to our inability to accurately identify end users of our product 
there are risks associated with serving the magnetic and optical storage markets 
the following are risks associated with serving the mass storage market 
historically dramatic supply and demand fluctuations in the magnetic disk drive market  which is closely linked to growth in the pc market  
direct correlation between the competitive nature of the disk drive industry and the price of disk drive components  
our dependence on the success of certain inch magnetic disk drive products that incorporate our products into their design  
our dependence on the successful introduction by our customers of new disk drive products that in turn can be impacted by the timing of customers transition to new disk drive products  
reduced demand for our mass storage products due to recent efforts by certain of our customers to develop their own ics for mass storage products  
our ability to respond effectively to the market trend of integrating hard disk controllers with micro controllers  and 
our ability to successfully compete with other firms with greater resources to accomplish the technical obstacles of integration and greater access to the advanced technologies necessary to provide integrated hdd electronic components 
there are risks related to serving the audio products markets 
in the audio products market  we have the potential to experience decreased revenues due to 
decreased average selling prices in the audio ic market due to the pc industry s transition to the ac link codecs attached to core logic using the multimedia features of the processor and single chip solution  
in the pc audio products market  the transition to core logic connected audio and by the introduction of cheaper  fully integrated  single chip audio ics  
aggressive competitive pricing pressures in the audio ics market  and 
the inability of our audio products to meet cost or performance requirements of the three dimensional  spatial effects audio market 
there are risks related to serving the precision data conversion market 
decreased revenues from sales to the precision mixed signal products market could be caused by the following 
our inability to establish broad sales channels and our failure to develop and maintain a sufficiently broad competitive product line  
customer delays in their product development and introductions  
our inability to reach the marketplace due to the technical complexity of our products and the time requirements for their development  and 
our inability to attract  hire  and retain scarce analog engineering talent necessary for rapid product development in this market 
there are risks related to serving the embedded processor products market 
we could experience decreased revenues from sales of our embedded processor products due to the following factors 
increased competition from other semiconductor manufacturers now entering the market due to the increased popularity of consumer goods incorporating embedded processor products  such as portable digital audio players  smart cellular phones  set top internet and e mail access boxes  and personal digital appliances  
our inability to meet embedded processor products requirements of an industry that has yet to define product standards  
customer delays in their product development and introductions  and 
price competition from over other embedded processor products manufacturers who have licensed arm ltd 
cpu cores  the same cpu core we license  and who will likely produce products around these cores which are very similar to ours 
shifts in industry wide capacity may cause our results to fluctuate and such shifts have resulted and could in the future result in significant inventory write downs 
shifts in industry wide capacity from shortages to oversupply or from oversupply to shortages may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
we must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity  overproduction  reduced demand or technological obsolescence  there is a risk that we will forecast inaccurately and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of our customers place orders with short lead times 
due to the product manufacturing cycle characteristic of integrated circuit manufacturing and the inherent imprecision by our customers to accurately forecast their demand  product inventories may not always correspond to product demand  leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products 
as a result of such inventory imbalances  future inventory write downs may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
because foundry capacity is limited we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
we currently purchase all of our wafers from outside foundries 
market conditions could result in wafers being in short supply and prevent us from having adequate supply to meet our customer requirements 
any prolonged inability to utilize our foundries as a result of fire  natural disaster or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our business could be harmed in the following ways 
our relationships with our customers would be harmed and consequently our sales would likely be reduced  and 
we may be forced to purchase wafers or packaging from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have entered into contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods 
in fact  during fiscal and fiscal  the industry experienced an excess in production capacity that we believe  in some cases  resulted in our competitors paying wafer prices which were lower than our cost of production from our manufacturing joint ventures 
consequently  we experienced pressures on our selling prices during fiscal years  and  which harmed our revenues and reduced our margins 
in the future  we may not be able to secure capacity with foundries in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
we are dependent on our subcontractors in asia to perform key manufacturing functions for us 
we depend on third party subcontractors in asia for the supply and packaging of our products 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on our sole and limited source suppliers  this concentration of suppliers and manufacturing operations in asia subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally  including political and economic conditions in asia 
any disruption or termination of any of our supply or manufacturing could occur  and such disruptions could harm our business and operating results 
we have significant international sales and risks associated with our international sales could harm our operating results 
export sales  principally to asia  include sales to u 
s based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  and accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales 
this reliance on sales internationally subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally  including political and economic conditions 
for example  the financial instability in a given region  such as asia  may have an adverse impact on the financial position of end users in the region which could impact future orders and or the ability of such users to pay us or our customers  which could also impact the ability of such customers to pay us 
while we expect to carefully evaluate the collection risk related to the financial position of customers and potential customers in structuring the terms of sale  in determining whether to accept sales orders  and in evaluating the recognition of revenue  if a region s volatility harms the financial position of our customers  our results of operations could be harmed 
our international sales operations involve a number of other risks  including 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  
delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for technology  
tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and 
the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  while we may buy hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  our competitive position can be affected by the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen 
consequently  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive 
we cannot assure you that regulatory  political and other factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
our success depends on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve our other intellectual property rights covering our manufacturing processes  products and development and testing tools 
we seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us 
notwithstanding our attempts to protect our proprietary rights  we believe that our future success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees rather than on patent and copyright ownership 
we also rely substantially on trade secrets and proprietary technology to protect our technology and manufacturing know how  and work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position 
although we are not currently a defendant to any material litigation  the integrated circuit industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we and our customers have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patents  maskwork rights  or copyrights on certain of our products and technologies 
although we are not currently a defendant to any material litigation  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license was not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be harmed 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
an unfavorable outcome in any such suit could have an adverse effect on our future operations and or liquidity 
strong competition in the high performance integrated circuit market may harm our business 
the high performance integrated circuit industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in our markets include 
product features  reliability  performance and price  
the diversity and timing of new product introductions  
the emergence of new computer standards and other customer systems  
product quality  
efficiency of production  and 
customer support 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting our products  our market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margin  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our principal competitors include analog devices  applied micro devices  atmel  burr brown  creative technologies  ess technologies  intel  linear technology  lucent technologies  motorola  st microelectronics  texas instruments and yamaha  many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
we expect intensified competition from emerging companies and from customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
increased competition could adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect our business and our financial condition 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  upon the continued service of our key engineering  marketing  sales  manufacturing  support  and executive personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense  and the loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our financial results are sensitive to securities prices  including our own in connection with the restructuring of the micrus joint venture  we issued million shares of our common stock in april of we made guarantees to ibm regarding the market value of that stock in future periods  and as a result  our earnings may be adversely affected in future periods by declines in the market price of our stock 
as of march   we own approximately million shares of common stock in phone 
com  inc with a market value of million 
during february of  we sold million call options in phone 
com for a premium of million with an average exercise price of approximately per share 
the fair value of our holdings in phone 
com stock will fluctuate as the stock price of phone 
com fluctuates 
the fair value of our holdings in phone 
com as of april  was million 
year update to date there has been no negative impact to our business as a result of the year date change 
we will continue to monitor date issues going forward but do not anticipate that such issues will affect our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on market securities  outstanding debt and non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and has established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at march  actual results may differ materially 
at march   our marketable securities consist of short term  fixed rate securities and long term debt  of which the majority represents convertible subordinated notes bearing interest at a fixed rate 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on either our debt or investment portfolios  and would also have no material impact on the results of operations 
a majority of the our revenue and spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through financial market instruments 
short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are managed by financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of both forward foreign exchange contracts and put and call options in order to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange policy also authorizes the use of hybrid foreign exchange products that combine elements of both options and forward contracts 
we will enter into contracts that are most attractive to our hedging position in the market at the time of execution 
any contracts executed by us are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transaction primarily japanese yen and the terms of the contracts generally match the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our foreign exchange policy allows for the use of forward and options contracts  as well as hybrids of these instruments  to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
the majority of our hedging transactions are considered cash flow hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
as currently anticipated under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 these instruments would be classified as derivatives and recorded at fair value 
as previously stated  the most common form of instruments used by us are forward contracts and options  primarily denominated in japanese yen 
we actively pursue options using a zero cost strategy where there is no operations impact to the execution of the underlying transaction 
the options are then marked to market on a monthly basis based upon fluctuations of the underlying currency in relation to the u 
s 
dollar  and the gains or losses are reflected in operations 
upon termination of the derivative instrument  the cumulative gain or loss is included in operations 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts receive similar treatment 
there were no open hedges at march  from time to time we may hedge our foreign currency exposures  primarily japanese yen denominated sales 
we repatriate these amounts on a quarterly or monthly basis  depending on underlying accounts receivable collections 
foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into at the beginning of each fiscal quarter in order to hedge these transactions and typically expire at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the transactions are marked to market  monthly and the cumulative gains or losses are recognized during the quarter operations 
in the event that the anticipated transaction did not occur  options contracts would expire with a negative impact to operations 
however  to the extent that we did not have like amounts of foreign currency in an offshore foreign exchange account  forward contracts would require us to purchase any deficient amount of the underlying currency at spot market rates in order to settle with our financial institution counter party 
any gains or losses from these types of transactions would be reflected in operations 
we believe that the impact of these types of occurrences would have an immaterial effect on our operations
