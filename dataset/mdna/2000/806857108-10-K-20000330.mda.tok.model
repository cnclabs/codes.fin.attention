results after continued slow activity across all regions in the first half of the year  oilfield services activity in north america started to improve in the third quarter as oil and gas companies continued to gradually increase their spending 
the seismic services industry experienced a severe downturn throughout this negative impact was felt across all regions within schlumberger  most notably in north america  europe and asia  and resulted in a significant decrease in seismic revenue 
oilfield services revenue declined compared with  in line with the estimated reduction in exploration and production e p expenditures  and consistent with the fall in the average rig count 
north america north american revenue fell  with a decline in the average rig count 
the slowdown was particularly dramatic in the first half of the year  with the average rig count down 
all product groups ended the year with lower revenue than in pretax operating income dropped 
increased activity during the fourth quarter was mainly focused on gas development projects  primarily in the lower states and canada 
latin america latin american revenue fell  in line with the decrease in the average rig count 
the reduced activity resulted from a slowdown in all product groups with the exception of drilling services  which saw a increase due to the commencement of mpsv multipurpose service vessel operations on lake maracaibo in venezuela 
pretax operating income was down  mainly due to lower prices and reduced activity across the region 
europe cis west africa revenue declined in the europe cis west africa region  in line with the decline in the average rig count 
revenue from all product groups and geographical areas fell  with the exception of the cis  where growth in pressure pumping activity fueled a notable increase in revenue over pretax operating income for the region decreased 
other eastern hemisphere revenue in other eastern hemisphere declined  led by significantly lower activity in the eastern mediterranean and the australia geomarket areas 
compared with  the average rig count fell in the middle east and in asia 
revenue from all services fell  with the exception of reservoir management as the mpsv bima continued to provide value added services to customers in indonesia 
pretax operating income fell 
camco camco revenue fell  with declines in all business lines except contract gas compression 
pretax operating income declined 
the new schlumberger reservoir completions center src was officially launched in october and showcased the successful integration of camco into schlumberger 
the event was attended by more than customers  investors and financial analysts 
more than schlumberger specialists work at this facility to develop advanced intelligent completions applications 
this technology is at the heart of many solutions schlumberger provides to its customers to meet the growing challenge of optimizing oil and gas recovery from new as well as existing reservoirs in a cost effective manner 
highlights addressing reservoir optimization through leading edge technology demonstrating success with record setting directional drilling technology applications has long been a hallmark of schlumberger service 
during at wytch farm  uk  schlumberger continued to play a major role as contractor for directional drilling  measurements while drilling mwd and logging while drilling lwd services on this extended reach drilling project 
during the year  the world s longest well extension  was drilled 
at mi km long and drilled in in hole  the well extension exceeded by ft m the prior record of mi km set by schlumberger in argentina earlier in the year 
drilling and casing the well at wytch farm took days  and the well also set a new industry depth record of  ft  m 
other high end technologies helped guide the drilling process by providing real time information at the bit  including the cdr compensated dual resistivity tool with annulus pressure measurements  the adn azimuthal density neutron tool and the powerpulse mwd telemetry system 
in addition  schlumberger set yet another record for the deepest mwd triple combo run  breaking the old record  also held by schlumberger  by ft m 
using advanced reservoir monitoring and control technology  schlumberger also found a way to tap reserves from the eastern extremities of the wytch farm reservoir in order to access two pockets of bypassed oil that otherwise would not have been economically recoverable 
schlumberger drilled an innovative dual lateral well and installed flow control devices in each wellbore to permit each to produce oil independently and to prolong the life of the new well 
these devices allow the customer to manage the production of each lateral well from the surface without costly interventions 
in addition to saving considerable future operational costs  production gains from the well are estimated at more than one million barrels over the life of the reservoir 
this technology received the bpamoco technology award for outstanding performance 
in a north sea well offshore norway  schlumberger installed surface controlled downhole valves to regulate the amounts of oil  gas and water entering the well  and used an innovative intelligent gas lift solution to assist in optimizing production from the well 
further installations will continue over the next three to four years  and it is estimated that over the year life of the field  this technology will improve overall production by  equal to million barrels 
an alliance between schlumberger and mobptech a cooperative e p technology program sponsored by mobil  bp amoco  texaco and chevron was established to build a commercial drilling simulator prototype for the oil and gas industry 
the prototype s pc based software applications work in conjunction with earth science interpretation and visualization tools to model the drilling process  from well planning through real time optimization  to post well analysis 
this innovative approach will create a comprehensive new framework within which previously stand alone components can work together seamlessly 
as a result  oil and gas companies will be able to develop reservoirs using the most cost efficient drilling program 
many new technologies developed by schlumberger were successfully introduced during the year 
working with a drilling company in venezuela  schlumberger established a new standard for drill bit performance  dramatically reducing the customer s costs while extending a well 
the operation was conducted using a single reed hycalog in gmt duradiamond bit  instead of several conventional bits  thereby avoiding unproductive rig time 
following its successful field tests in many locations around the world  the hrla high resolution laterolog array tool also successfully completed field testing in the middle east 
the tool s improved true resistivity measurement provides more accurate information about reservoir fluids and their movement 
in field tests during the fourth quarter  the new slimpulse third generation slim hole retrievable mwd system achieved outstanding results 
the slimpulse application was designed to operate in wellbore diameters as small as in  with the capability for extended longevity in high temperature and high shock environments 
following a highly successful field test  the first ever commercial order for the rapidconnect multilateral system was received for an application in west africa 
the system will be used to provide a high strength junction through which a second offshoot well will be drilled and completed  enabling more economic access to additional reserves 
designed to reduce completion and production costs  rapidconnect technology can be used in both new and existing wells 
coupled with other schlumberger multilateral technologies  this advanced application creates field development and redevelopment opportunities throughout west africa and in other hydrocarbon basins around the world 
clearfrac fracturing fluid sales continued to grow as an increasing number of customers experienced the benefits of this unique system 
in its latest successful application  clearfrac fluid was used by eni agip to rehabilitate sand control completions in the giovanna gas fields in italy 
the use of clearfrac fluid more than doubled the rate of production and yielded significant productivity increases on a number of the wells 
ultimately  total platform production tripled following the clearfrac treatments 
maximizing value through equipment integration and optimization in its drive to make production operations more efficient  schlumberger launched three new mpsvs prisa  and on lake maracaibo  venezuela 
the launch of these advanced multipurpose vessels followed the introduction of the mpsv bima offshore indonesia in the fourth quarter of schlumberger mpsv technology provides a complete well intervention package and ensures rapid  efficient operations through reduced logistic requirements  costs and weather related downtime 
in march  schlumberger launched the industry s most advanced seismic vessel  geco eagle 
its innovative aft deck design and state of the art data acquisition equipment address the industry s need for more accurately and efficiently acquired surveys 
expanded capacity allows this single vessel to tow up to streamers in combination  with spreads as wide as m 
ft 
geco eagle broke several world records during its first acquisition contract in brazil the vessel took fewer than seven days between deploying the first streamer section and recording the first commercial streamer production  once in full service  geco eagle was the first vessel to deploy km mi of streamers  and  geco eagle also recorded the world s biggest single vessel tow  ten m mi streamers  as well as the largest footprint 
in december  schlumberger launched the deepstim vessel  the first in a new class of stimulation vessels designed to operate in the gulf of mexico and other deepwater environments 
the deepstim vessel is equipped with the latest technology for data acquisition and transmission  process control and environmental waste containment 
its large size provides greater stability in severe weather  and its higher capacity allows the vessel to remain at sea for extended periods  thereby greatly reducing customer costs

resource management services results throughout  the uncertainty created by deregulation  privatization and globalization in the utility industry continued to delay investment by many utilities in new products and services 
still  in electricity and gas markets around the world there were encouraging signs of change 
in the us and parts of europe  where deregulation has advanced the furthest  major contract awards have demonstrated the increased interest in the schlumberger solutions approach 
resource management services rms revenue declined and orders fell compared with the downturn resulted from continuing pressure on prices and the negative impact of currency movements 
adverse economic conditions in brazil  which underwent a currency devaluation  and in the cis  also contributed to the downturn 
pretax operating income dropped  reflecting margin deterioration and charges during the year 
contributions came from north america and asia  where market growth and higher shipments made a positive impact on business 
in north america  revenue increased  while orders rose  reflecting a strong new housing market in the us and canada 
demand for electricity meters was high  including a contribution from the new centron static meter with built in amr automatic meter reading capabilities 
an agreement signed with peco energy of philadelphia in october included the installation of  of these new meters 
schlumberger will also provide asset management and metering data services to peco for over more than two million metering points over a year period 
on february   schlumberger agreed to acquire the assets of cellnet data systems  inc the acquisition will be handled through a chapter procedure and is subject to final approval by the bankruptcy court 
european revenue declined and orders slipped due to continued price pressure  lower demand for electricity products in the uk and ongoing unfavorable business conditions in the cis 
in stockholm  a major thermal energy data management project  begun in the third quarter  progressed on schedule and highlighted the trend toward integrated metering data networks as well as our ability to provide large scale  customized solutions

in belgium  a large utility confirmed an order for the first phase of a multiresource electricity and gas prepayment system using the talexus vendor system and payguard smart card based vending units for  residences 
in south america  revenue dropped and orders decreased 
business was affected by a significant fall off in brazil s domestic activity due to broad public spending cuts and the devaluation of the national currency 
revenue in asia increased and orders jumped  reflecting both a return of new investment in the region after the economic downturn last year and continued growth in exports 
shipments of water meters commenced from a new factory in south australia  and there was a rise in shipments of residential electricity meters to taiwan and commercial and industrial meters to thailand 
results rms revenue fell in compared with the decline resulted from lower demand for electricity and gas products as well as from difficult financial environments in developing countries 
product orders were flat for the year 
in europe  revenue declines caused by industrial overcapacity and price competition were offset by higher electricity sales to edp  the portuguese national electric company 
north american revenue was down  reflecting market uncertainty caused by ongoing electricity deregulation in the us 
however  revenue from africa and the middle east rose  driven by stronger gas and water meter shipments to north africa and turkey 
pretax operating income dropped  reflecting margin deterioration due to lower sales in north and south america  france and germany 
favorable contributions came from south and central europe and from savings as a result of the restructuring of rms  which was initiated in results revenue for rms fell compared with  as poor business conditions severely impacted european electricity and gas metering activity 
orders fell the revenue decline was highest in italy and in the uk 
south american revenue grew significantly on high demand for water meters and the newly introduced single phase  electromechanical meter 
north america experienced strong water and gas meter sales 
pretax operating income fell due to deregulation and privatization of the world s utilities accompanied by restricted procurements 
test transactions results revenue at test transactions  including customer solutions activities and omnes  declined compared with orders rose 
the year was characterized by volatility due to changing business environments in several test transactions market segments 
smart cards terminals  whose business continues to be derived in part from emerging economies  suffered from pricing pressures associated with highly competitive markets  such as mobile communications 
automated test equipment ate was negatively impacted by market uncertainties associated with the rambus memory device rollout as well as by a softening in the high end logic test business  a market in which ate maintains share leadership 
smart cards terminals revenue improved versus  while ate revenue including saber schlumberger advanced business engineering resources services  decreased 
orders for smart cards terminals and ate both increased  and  respectively 
during  new product introductions at both smart cards terminals and ate contributed to test transactions revenue 
fourteen new products were introduced at ate 
smart cards terminals successfully launched the simera java programmable subscriber identity module sim card  cryptoflex e gate cards and magic terminals into the booming gsm  pc and retail markets 
the rapid growth of the mobile communications market  which was accompanied by increasing demand for multi application and open platform cards  provided a strong impetus for the accelerated adoption of the simera cards as well as the continued use of cyberflex simera cards 
however  despite a strong increase in orders for sim cards over  global price pressure significantly reduced the revenue generated 
card sales grew in both asia and europe  the two most prominent consumer markets for smart cards 
the smart cards terminals municipalities solutions business experienced revenue growth for the second consecutive year 
in  solutions sales showed a significant increase over  with key contributions from parking and mass transit applications 
at ate  schlumberger entered the front end process equipment semiconductor equipment business with the first shipments of the odyssey wafer defect detection system 
although the initiative to focus on rambus dynamic random access memory rdram technology resulted in an early leadership position for schlumberger  the slow pace of the emerging rdram market delayed orders 
results compared with  revenue for test transactions rose 
smart cards terminals  including the smart card based solutions businesses  grew  while ate  including saber services activities  was flat 
both businesses experienced volatile business cycles but outpaced their respective markets 
in  smart card volume increased more than compared with the industry s growth rate of 
despite an industry downturn  ate increased market share for mixed signal and logic test systems 
in october  the retail petroleum systems business was sold to tokheim corporation 
test transactions benefited from its reorganization into three groups solutions  products and manufacturing 
products and manufacturing provide product core expertise  while the regional solutions groups deliver integrated solutions and services 
each group aligned its roles and responsibilities to enhance its customer orientation 
the transition to the new organization moved quickly and yielded improved quality  customer focus and integrated systems offerings 
throughout the year  smart cards terminals concentrated on growing its share of key smart card markets mobile phones  finance and banking  municipalities parking and mass transit and health care which presented significant opportunities for the smart card based solutions and systems integration businesses 
one successful system integration business was exemplified by the launch of the cyberflex mobile solution 
this integrated product and service offering included a cyberflex simera smart card  a software developer s kit with an easy to use simnario graphical interface for rapid prototyping  the aremis sim based service management system and the aremis marketing platform 
schlumberger also offered a wide range of consulting  engineering and turnkey project management services to facilitate the design of these systems 
strong revenue growth came from the mobile phone sim card market  from financial and banking cards and from the municipalities solutions business  which comprises smart card based parking  pay phone and mass transit systems 
the stelio parking system was successfully introduced and made a significant contribution to revenue 
at ate  strong orders in the first half of the year were offset by the decline during the second half 
activity at ate system services was up year over year 
to reflect the downturn in the semiconductor business  a cost reduction plan was implemented in ate 
investments for critical new product developments  however  were maintained 
during the year  ate introduced d rdram  sdram and rdram memory test systems 
the new rdx series of rdram test systems was anticipated to establish a new market standard for test accuracy  throughput and cost 
the rdx series of test systems developed its accuracy and performance advantage from ate test technology in high end logic design and test methodology 
also successfully introduced in was the ids probe system 
this laser based system  focused on the emerging flip chip market  provides the same diagnostic capabilities as high end e beam tools 
several ids systems were installed during the year 
in  the saber services group was formed and achieved profitability 
the saber business model  which derives from the schlumberger service culture  is an innovative concept that provides consulting  turnkey engineering and operational services for the semiconductor industry 
results test transactions revenue grew versus this higher growth resulted mainly from significantly greater ate activity  increased demand for smart cards and terminals and previously announced acquisitions 
pretax operating income and orders grew and  respectively 
smart cards terminals revenue was higher than in  mainly due to smart card sales  including the solaic activity acquired in december increasing demand for both microprocessor and memory cards used in cellular mobile communications  banking and pay phone applications led schlumberger to establish additional smart card production operations in hong kong and mexico  which resulted in improved telecom equipment sales 
ate revenue rose  compared with ate market share increased across all semiconductor test market segments 
orders increased  due largely to stronger demand for the its family of products at test systems and sales of the px semiconductor analysis system 
in october  ate acquired interactive video systems  inc  a metrology solutions provider for the front end semiconductor fabrication equipment market

for details  see and charges continuing operations on page includes an after tax charge of million per share diluted 
for details  see and charges continuing operations on page in  oilfield services operating net income decreased million  or  to million 
all areas reported substantial declines as a result of the worldwide reduction in e p expenditures due to reduced oil prices  which led to a fall in average rig count 
resource management services operating net income of million was down million  or 
test transactions operating net income decreased million  or  to million  as stronger results from smart cards terminals activities were more than offset by declines at ate  which was negatively impacted by rambus related market uncertainties and by a softening of the high end logic test business for which it is a leading supplier 
in  oilfield services operating net income of million was down  reflecting the decrease in average rig count 
the main decrease was in north america  which was impacted by strong pricing pressure and a slowdown in activity in the second half of the year 
resource management services operating net income decreased million  or  largely due to market weakness as a result of industry consolidation and privatization  compounded by the financial crisis in emerging countries 
test transactions operating net income of million was down as growth in the smart cards terminals activities was offset by a severe market decline for ate  due to curtailment of capital expenditures by the semiconductor industry in the latter half of the year 
in  oilfield services operating net income increased million  or  to billion 
the growth reflected the continued higher demand for oil and gas and the strong increase in exploration and production spending by oil companies 
these underlying factors  combined with new technology and greater efficiencies  resulted in stronger pricing and higher market share 
the asian and north american markets were significant growth areas 
resource management services operating net income decreased million  or  due to the adverse exchange rate effects and to a decline in the european metering activities  which were impacted by increased competition and severe price erosion 
test transactions operating net income increased million  or  reflecting significantly increased demand for semiconductor test equipment and smart cards and systems  as well as higher activity in asia 
currency risks refer to page  translation of non us currencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a description of the schlumberger policy on currency hedging 
there are no material unhedged assets  liabilities or commitments which are denominated in other than a business s functional currency 
while changes in exchange rates do affect revenue  especially in the resource management services and test transactions segments  they also affect costs 
generally speaking  schlumberger is currency neutral 
for example  a change in average exchange rates of oecd currencies would have had no material effect on consolidated revenue and net income 
schlumberger businesses operate principally in us dollars  most european currencies and most south american currencies 
in general  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies  consolidated revenue increases  usually with no material effect on net income 
this is principally because the fall through incremental margin in the resource management services and test transactions segments offset the higher oilfield services non us dollar denominated expenses 
income tax expense in  with increasing profitability and a strong outlook in the us  schlumberger recognized of the us income tax benefit related to its us subsidiary s tax loss carryforward and all temporary differences 
this resulted in a credit of million 
refer to page in the notes to consolidated financial statements under income tax expense for more information 
in  the remaining of the us income tax benefit was recognized  which resulted in no significant reduction of income tax expense 
research engineering expenditures were as follows stated in millions oilfield services resource management services test transactions other primarily comprises the retail petroleum systems business sold on october  interest expense interest expense increased million in  primarily due to a full year s effect of the significantly higher debt balances incurred in by the principal us subsidiary of schlumberger and relating to the camco acquisition 
the increase in interest expense in of million was mainly due to the financing of the camco acquisition 
and charges continuing operations schlumberger recorded the following after tax charges for continuing operations in and 
in december  million primarily relating to the reduction of its marine seismic fleet due to depressed market conditions and the restructuring of its land drilling activity following the spin off of its offshore drilling business to stockholders 

in march  million primarily relating to the downsizing of its global oilfield services activities to meet prevailing market conditions  and an after tax credit of million from the gain on sale of financial instruments in connection with the sale of the retail petroleum systems business 

in september  million to reflect the estimated costs of consolidating resources and locations and making significant cuts in personnel necessitated by the e p industry downturn 
severance costs included in the september charge people and the march charge people have been paid 
the december charge included severance costs of million people of which million had been paid by december  liquidity a measure of financial position is liquidity  defined as cash plus short term and long term investments  less debt 
the following table summarizes the change in schlumberger consolidated liquidity for each of the past three years stated in millions net income from continuing operations  charges depreciation amortization   decrease increase in working capital requirements fixed assets additions   dividends paid proceeds from employee stock plans business acquired sold exercise of stock warrants sale of financial instruments drilling fluids joint venture discontinued operations other net increase in liquidity liquidity end of period  restated for comparative purposes 
on december   dow chemical exercised a warrant to purchase  shares of schlumberger common stock 
the warrant was received by dow chemical as part of the transaction under which schlumberger acquired dow chemical s share of the dowell schlumberger joint venture

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that schlumberger recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value
