overview the company designs  develops and markets high performance semiconductor solutions for sale to original equipment manufacturers of mobile computing products including notebook pcs  and over the last several years  began development of digital cameras and dvd drives 
in february  the company announced that it is seeking to sell the dvd product group which is still in the research and development phase 
the company has determined that embedded dram now provides less value in the current dvd market than anticipated 
the dvd market is very cost sensitive  and has little regard for low power electronics or form factor integration  taking the product line further away from the company s embedded dram technology 
the company pioneered the first commercially available high performance silicon technology that integrates dram  complex logic and analog circuits into a single chip 
the company s proprietary magicware tm technology eliminates the need to drive signals off chip to discrete memory  achieving its performance advantage while actually lowering the power consumption and extending the battery life for smaller  lighter weight portable devices 
the first commercial application for the company s technology is in the design  development and marketing of multimedia accelerators for sale to notebook computer manufacturers 
the company s magicgraph and magicmedia families of pin compatible multimedia accelerators incorporate bit and bit memory buses  respectively 
all of the company s net sales in fiscal  and were derived from sales of its multimedia accelerator products  and the company expects this trend to continue at least through fiscal the company generally recognizes revenue upon title passage for product sales directly to customers 
the company s policy is to defer recognition of revenue of shipments to distributors until the distributors sell the product 
historically  a majority of the company s sales have been to a limited number of customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for   and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that a substantial portion of sales of its products will continue to be to a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future 
the customers contributing significant amounts of net sales have varied and will continue to vary depending on the timing and success of new product introductions by neomagic and its customers 
the company s products require semiconductor wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and technology 
neomagic currently has strategic relationships with mitsubishi electric corporation  infineon technologies  formerly siemens aktiengesellschaft semiconductor group has also purchased wafers from toshiba corporation during fiscal to produce its semiconductor wafers and uses other independent contractors to perform assembly  packaging and testing 
the company s foundry relationships are formalized in separate five year wafer supply agreements 
these relationships enable the company to concentrate its resources on product design and development  where neomagic believes it has greater competitive advantages  and to eliminate the high cost of owning and operating a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility 
the company depends on these suppliers to allocate to the company a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to the company on a timely basis 
the company purchases wafers and pays an agreed price for wafers meeting certain acceptance criteria 
all of the company s products are assembled and tested by independent vendors 
to date  the majority of the company s wafer purchases  which constitute a majority of its cost of sales  have been priced in japanese yen 
as a result  exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company s gross margin 
the company experienced such fluctuations during fiscal which have negatively impacted the company s gross margin and earnings 
the company has in the past hedged its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the japanese yen and the united states dollar by purchasing forward contracts and options and may continue to do so in the future 
under its wafer supply agreements  the company is obligated to provide rolling month forecasts of anticipated purchases and place binding purchase orders up to three to four months prior to shipment 
if the company cancels a purchase order  the company must pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
forecasts of monthly purchases may not increase or decrease by more than a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast without the manufacturer s consent 
thus  the company must forecast and place purchase orders for wafers long before it receives purchase orders from its own customers 
this limits the company s ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products  which can be unexpected and dramatic and from time to time will cause the company to have an excess or a shortage of wafers for a particular product  which could cause the company to take charges for excess inventory or miss revenue opportunities 
prior to fiscal  the company was primarily engaged in research and development and testing of its products 
accordingly  the majority of its operating expenses were related to research and development activities 
in fiscal  in connection with the commencement of commercial sales of its products  the company accelerated its investment in sales  marketing  manufacturing and administrative infrastructures 
throughout fiscal  the company has continued to devote resources to research and development efforts as well as to make additional investments in sales  marketing  manufacturing and administrative infrastructures to support the increased sales 
the company expects to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development efforts for the foreseeable future 
however  given the company s projections for downward revenue and its corresponding cost control efforts  research and development expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal all of the company s research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
the company s fiscal year end is january any references herein to a fiscal year refers to the year ended january of such year 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of net sales year ended january  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income and other interest expense 

income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales the company s net sales to date have been generated from the sale of its multimedia accelerators 
the company s products are used in  and its business is dependent upon  the personal computer industry with sales primarily in asia  japan  and the united states 
net sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net sales increased primarily from shipments of the company s products in its magicmedia and magicgraph product families  and the company s investment in sales and marketing activities 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
due to competition  the life cycle of the company s products and the trend in the market toward lower cost notebook computers  the company s products have  and may continue to experience declining unit average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
the company expects that net sales  for fiscal will decline over the current year levels due to delays in new product introductions which have caused the company to lose design wins and market share 
over the past year  delays in the introduction and ramping of the company s new products have caused the company to miss current oem s design cycles which has eroded the company s market share and has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to foreign operations customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions were denominated in united states dollars 
five customers accounted for    and respectively  of net sales in fiscal three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal five customers accounted for    and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated with a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers  or that such customers will not cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event orders are canceled  that such orders will be replaced by other orders 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the occurrence of any such events or the loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gross margin gross margin was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the gross margin percentage decreased to of net sales in fiscal from of net sales in fiscal due primarily to increases in wafer prices for the company s magicmedia product line 
also affecting fiscal gross margin was a decrease in the dollar yen exchange rate throughout the year and low production yields on new product ramp ups 
the gross margin percentage decreased to of net sales in fiscal from of net sales in fiscal due to declines in unit average selling prices stemming from the market trend toward lower priced notebooks and increased competition 
these factors were mitigated in part by other product cost decreases stemming from the company s cost reduction efforts 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  manufacturing yields particularly on new products  continued trend in the market toward lower priced notebooks  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has announced that it expects declines in revenues  gross margins  and results of operations for fiscal based on the delay of the introduction of its new products 
as a result of this delay  the company s existing products may experience sharper declines in demand and average selling prices and the company s inventories on order may not be fully sellable at acceptable prices which would necessitate inventory write offs either for excess quantities or lower of cost or market considerations 
such a write off  when determined  would have a material adverse effect on gross margins and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  operating system software costs and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has made  and intends to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve its identified markets 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal primarily as a result of increased employee related expenses on higher headcount  increased prototyping costs associated with new product development  and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of acl and the optical drive development group of mitel corporation 
because the company s projections for downward revenue will result in corresponding cost control  research and development expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal due primarily to lower outside commissions and the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as a result of increased commissions associated with higher sales levels and increased employee related expenses largely related to additional personnel and legal costs related to the intellectual property lawsuit 
because the company s projections for downward revenue will result in decreased commissions and cost control  sales  general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal acquired in process research and development the company incurred approximately million of charges for acquired in process research and development iprd in connection with its fiscal acquisitions of the optical drive storage group from mitel semiconductor and associative computers  ltd  acl 
the amount allocated to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from each of the technologies under development to their net present value  at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
the technologies under development were analyzed to determine their technological accomplishments  the existence and utilization of core technologies  the existence of any alternative future uses  their technological feasibility  and the stage of completion of the development activities  including the efforts required to complete the remaining development activities 
the technologies under development were classified as developed technology  iprd completed  iprd to be completed or future development activities 
projected future net cash flows attributable to each of these categories were discounted to their net present value using a discount rate which was derived based on the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium to account for the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful completion of each project and the associated estimated cash flows 
the iprd charge includes only the fair value of iprd completed 
the technologies underlying the iprd amounts were deemed to have no alternative future uses 
the fair value assigned to developed technology is included in other assets  and no value was assigned to the iprd to be completed or future development activities 
the company believes that these fair values do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for each such in process technology 
failure to timely deliver commercially viable products to the market  or to achieve market acceptance or the revenue and expense forecasts could have a significant impact on the financial results and operations of the acquired businesses 
the total charge for iprd for the optical drive storage group transaction  completed in february  was approximately million 
the technologies acquired from this group were mixed signal analog and digital video disk dvd optical storage read channel technologies 
the optical drive storage group s development efforts were estimated to be approximately complete at the date of the acquisition 
neomagic planned to integrate these technologies with its embedded dram technologies and develop products for the dvd notebook  dvd desktop and dvd player recorder markets 
prior to the acquisition  the optical drive storage group had generated no revenues 
revenue from commercially viable products for these markets was not anticipated until late calendar or in the discount rates used for the iprd technologies and developed technologies were and  respectively 
the total charge for iprd for the acl transaction  completed in february  was approximately million 
the technologies acquired from acl were associative array parallel processing architectures that enabled high speed computing 
acl s development efforts were estimated to be approximately complete at the date of the acquisition 
neomagic planned to integrate these technologies with its embedded dram technologies and develop products for the digital camera and camcorder markets 
prior to the acquisition  acl had generated no revenues 
revenues from commercially viable products for the above markets were not anticipated until late calendar the discount rates used for the iprd technologies and developed technologies were each 
except for the company s plans to no longer pursue the development activities acquired from the optical drive storage group  there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used in the iprd analyses relating to the timing of expected future revenues or the amount of development expenses and efforts expected to be required to bring the in process research and development technologies to completion and to achieve such revenues 
although management believes it will realize its net investment in the technology and related net assets acquired from the optical drive storage group million  significant uncertainties exist and circumstances currently unknown may result in the need to recognize an impairment of those assets in future financial periods 
should impairment occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
interest income and other the company earns interest on its cash and short term investments 
interest income and other was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal stemmed from higher interest income earned on higher cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense the company pays interest and commissions on wafer purchases and interest on its leases 
interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal reflects lower interest and commission rates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the working capital line of credit 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance related to acquisitions during the year  offset by research and development credits 
the increase in the fiscal effective tax rate stems from net operating loss carryforwards being fully utilized in fiscal the difference between the company s fiscal effective tax rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to the utilization of research and development tax credits 
the difference between the company s fiscal effective tax rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from cash provided by operating activities  offset in part by the two acquisitions completed in february for million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from cash provided by operating activities  offset in part by the pay down of the working capital line of credit and investments in property  plant and equipment 
in january  in exchange for a lower commission rate  the payment terms on wafer purchases were changed from payable in days from shipment to payable in days from shipment 
working capital increased million to million at january  from million at january  cash and cash equivalents provided from operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal   and respectively 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from million in net income and a decrease in inventory  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from million in net income  an increase in accounts payable and a reduction in deferred taxes  offset in part by increased accounts receivable  inventory and other assets 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from million in net income and increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and deferred taxes 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million respectively 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal related primarily to cash paid of million for two acquisitions  million of net purchases of short term investments and million of investments in property  plant and equipment 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal related primarily to million of net purchases of short term investments and million of investments in property  plant and equipment 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was related to net purchases of short term investments and investments in property  plant and equipment 
continued operation of the company s business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  technology investments  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of future investments will depend primarily on the level of the company s future revenues 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  compared to net cash used for financing activities of million in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represents net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal related primarily to the pay down of the working capital line of credit of million  offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represents net proceeds from the initial public offering of million  net proceeds related to the working capital line of credit and the release of amounts previously held as restricted cash 
at january   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company believes that it will not generate cash over the upcoming twelve months  and believes the current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months 
investments will continue in new product development in new and existing areas of technology 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of net sales  the timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs  the timing of any new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company expects that it may need to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of currency exchange rates because the company currently purchases the majority of its wafers under purchase contracts denominated in yen  significant appreciation in the value of the yen relative to the value of the us dollar would make the wafers relatively more expensive to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these firm purchase commitments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on the company s designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures the company has adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can the company predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
the company experienced such fluctuations during fiscal which have negatively impacted the company s gross margin and results of operations 
impact of year as of the date of this filing  the company has not incurred any significant business disruptions as a result of year issues 
we are also not aware of any material problems with our customers or vendors 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material disruptions as a result of any year issues 
factors that may affect results fluctuations in quarterly operating results neomagic s quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect net sales  gross margin and income from operations 
these factors include  among others  availability and cost of manufacturing capacity  demand for the company s products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in product or customer mix ie the portion of the company s revenues represented by the company s various products and customers  incorrect forecasting of future revenues  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction or performance of the company s next generation of products  the company s ability to introduce new products in accordance with oem design requirements and design cycles  the company s ability to leverage its technology across new markets  market acceptance of the end products of the company s customers  changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of products of the company s customers or due to the life cycles of such customers products ending earlier than anticipated  new product announcements or product introductions by neomagic s competitors  competitive pressures resulting in lower average selling prices  the volume of orders that are received and can be fulfilled in a quarter  the rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers which cannot be replaced with orders from other customers  supply constraints for the other components incorporated into its customers notebook pc products  the unanticipated loss of any strategic relationship  seasonality associated with the tendency of pc sales to increase in the second half of each calendar year  the level of expenditures for research and development and sales  general and administrative functions of the company  costs associated with future litigation  and costs associated with protecting the company s intellectual property 
any one or more of these factors could result in the company failing to achieve its expectations as to future revenues and profits 
the company may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could materially adversely affect quarterly operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
since the company s announcement of its expectation of declining revenues  gross margins and operating results  the market price of the common stock has been and is expected to be for some time in the future  materially adversely affected 
risks associated with dependence on the notebook pc market the company s products are currently used only in notebook pcs 
the notebook pc market is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and significant price competition  resulting in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product 
although the notebook pc market has grown substantially in recent years  there is no assurance that such growth will continue 
a reduction in sales of notebook pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of such sales  would likely reduce demand for the company s products 
moreover  such changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted product transitions 
in such cases  the pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers such as the company until the excess inventory has been absorbed 
any reduction in the demand for notebook pcs in general  or for a particular product that incorporates the company s multimedia accelerators  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to compete in the future will depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards 
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render the company s products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers  including intel corporation and microsoft corporation 
the company could be required  as a result  to invest significant time and effort to redesign its products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if the company s products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  the company could miss crucial oem design cycles  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
over the past year  delays in the introduction and ramping of the company s new products have caused the company to miss current oem s design cycles which has eroded the company s market share and has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s products are designed to afford the notebook pc manufacturer significant advantages with respect to product performance  power consumption and size 
to the extent that other future developments in notebook pc components or subassemblies incorporate one or more of the advantages offered by the company s products  the market demand for the company s products may be negatively impacted  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product concentration  risks associated with multimedia products the company s revenues currently are entirely dependent on the market for multimedia accelerators for notebook pcs  and on the company s ability to compete in that market 
since the company has no other revenue generating product line  the company s revenues and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if for any reason it were unsuccessful in selling multimedia accelerators or technology advances eliminated or reduced the demand for such accelerators 
the notebook pc market frequently undergoes transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if the company s products were unable to support the new feature sets or performance levels stemming from such a transition  the company would likely not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until it was able to incorporate the new feature sets or performance requirements into its products 
a failure to develop products with required feature sets or performance standards  or a delay as short as a few months in bringing a new product to market  could significantly reduce the company s net sales for a substantial period  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  the company experienced a manufacturing delay in bringing its new product into the market in the required time frame with the appropriate feature set  resulting in an adverse effect to the company s results of operations for fiscal these events are expected to continue to cause a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in fiscal the notebook pc multimedia market is characterized by extreme price competition 
leading edge products may command higher average selling prices  but prices decline throughout the product life cycle as comparable and more advanced products are introduced into the market 
as a result  the company s ability to maintain average selling prices and gross margins depends substantially on its ability to continue introducing new products 
its ability to maintain gross margins is also dependent upon its ability to reduce product costs throughout a product life cycle by instituting cost reduction design changes and yield improvements  persuading customers to adopt cost reduced versions of its products  and successfully managing its manufacturing and subcontractor relationships 
failure by the company to continually design and introduce advanced products in a timely manner and to reduce product costs on these older products would have  and is having  a material adverse effect on the company s net sales  gross margins and results of operations 
as a result of the delay and interruption of new product introductions  the company will experience a material adverse effect on revenues  gross margins and operating results for fiscal accordingly  the company has announced its plan to restructure its business for the expected decreased revenue related to its current expectations 
consumer product execution the company announced the formation of the consumer products division in june the division was formed to explore consumer semiconductor product opportunities in emerging markets such as digital video disks  digital cameras  and other consumer products that can benefit from the advantages of embedded dram magicware tm technology pioneered by neomagic 
in february  the company completed two acquisitions to further the development efforts of the consumer products division 
the company acquired the optical drive development group and associated dvd intellectual properties from mitel semiconductor in manchester  england and the assets and intellectual properties of acl of tel aviv  israel from robomatix technologies ltd 
the dvd and digital camera markets are new and evolving 
any such new product development program faces substantial risks and uncertainties  including risks as to the costs  timing and results of engineering efforts  competitive risks and market development risks 
in february  the company announced that it is seeking to sell the dvd product group that is still in the research and development phase 
the company has determined that embedded dram now provides less value in the current dvd market than previously anticipated 
the evolving dvd market is very cost sensitive  and has little regard for low power electronics or form factor integration  taking the product line further away from the company s embedded dram technology 
the company s ability to compete in new markets such as digital camera and other consumer products will depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards  develop and market compelling semiconductor solutions  and deliver those solutions to the market in a timely and cost effective manner 
there can be no assurance that future products the company expects to introduce will incorporate the features  functionality and pricing demanded by the market  or will be introduced within the appropriate window of market demand 
the failure of the company to successfully introduce new products and achieve market acceptance for such products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the delay in introducing its products in a time frame and cost structure that makes such products competitive  the company is currently reconsidering its product plans and research and development efforts for fiscal the company cannot predict what impact these efforts will have on future periods 
customer concentration the company s sales are concentrated within a limited customer base in the notebook pc market 
the company expects that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the majority of the company s sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than pursuant to long term purchase agreements 
as a result  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the decision of a single customer to cease using the company s products  or by a decline in the number of notebook pcs sold by a single customer 
effects of changes in dram pricing the company s products feature large dram memory integrated with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip  while its competitors often provide discrete analog and logic circuitry to be used in conjunction with dram supplied by others 
the selling prices of the company s products reflect many factors  including the prices of dram chips 
as the company places firm purchase commitments for wafers some to months in advance  significant reductions in the market price of dram could cause the company s products to become less competitively priced relative to competing discrete solutions with non integrated dram 
in this circumstance  the company could be forced to respond to pricing pressures precipitated by changes in the dram market by reducing the average selling prices of its products to current and prospective customers 
recently  the dram market has experienced significant price erosion  which has been a factor in the overall decline in the average selling price of the company s products 
because the company s product costs cannot be adjusted as rapidly as changes in the market price of dram  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by unanticipated changes in the price of dram 
competition the market for multimedia accelerators for notebook pcs in which the company competes is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
neomagic believes that the principal factors of competition in this market are performance  price  features  power consumption  size and software support 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving notebook pc market depends on a number of factors  including success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality  reliability  price  the efficiency of production  design wins for neomagic s integrated circuits  ramp up of production of the company s products for particular system manufacturers  end user acceptance of the system manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
neomagic competes with major domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
the company s principal competitors include ati technologies ati  chips technologies  inc chips technologies in january  intel corporation acquired chips and technologies  s incorporated s and trident microsystems  inc trident 
neomagic may also face increased competition from new entrants into the notebook pc multimedia accelerator market including companies currently selling products designed for desktop pcs 
some of the company s competitors  including chips technologies and trident have announced or introduced multimedia accelerator products that integrate large dram with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip 
certain of the company s competitors may offer products with more functionality and or higher processor speeds at the expense of battery life and power consumption than the company s product offerings 
these feature sets may be more competitive for certain applications than the company s products 
ati  during  produced and increased market share with a multi chip module mcm accelerator solution 
the mcm solution increases access memory both internally in the packaged module and externally  with connections to discrete memory on the motherboard  for higher performance at the expense of battery life and power consumption 
some of the company s competitors  including chips technologies and trident  have announced or introduced multimedia accelerator products that integrate large dram with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip 
these feature sets may be more competitive for certain applications than the company s products 
potential competition also could come from manufacturers that integrate the multimedia accelerator with other systems components 
for example  intel corporation is in production with products that integrate microprocessors and graphics accelerators 
further  several of the company s competitors have announced plans to develop products that integrate the multimedia accelerator with the core logic chip set 
the successful commercial introduction by competitors of products that integrate dram with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip  or that eliminate the need for a separate multimedia accelerator in notebook pcs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
some of the company s current and potential competitors operate their own manufacturing facilities 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facility and must make binding commitments to purchase products  it may not be able to reduce its costs and cycle time or adjust its production to meet changing demand as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company expects that its revenues will decline significantly from the prior year s revenue and accordingly is monitoring its inventory levels for product on hand and on order 
the company orders wafers for deliveries at least months in advance and with the additional time to assemble and test wafers  the company can have orders for finished goods that will not be available for up to six months into the future 
if the company does not have sufficient demand for its products and cannot cancel its current and future commitments without material impact  the company may experience excess inventory  which will result in write offs affecting gross margin and results of operations 
dependence on manufacturing relationships the company s products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
mitsubishi electric and toshiba in japan and infineon in germany currently manufacture the company s wafers 
each of these manufacturing relationships is covered under the terms of a five year wafer supply agreement 
the company expects that  for the foreseeable future  some of its products will be manufactured by a single source 
since  in the company s experience  the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new dram partner is at least months  and the estimated time for a foundry to switch to a new product line ranges from four to nine months  there may be no readily available alternative source of supply for specific products 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by any of the company s manufacturing partners or the failure of one of the company s manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies by the company s manufacturing partners is unsuccessful  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there are many other risks associated with the company s dependence upon third party manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality  manufacturing yields and cost  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on wafers supplied to the company  and potential misappropriation of neomagic s intellectual property 
the company is dependent on its manufacturing partners to produce wafers with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields  deliver those wafers on a timely basis to the company s third party assembly subcontractors and to allocate to the company a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs 
although the company s products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturer  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will continue to devote adequate resources to the production of the company s products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the company s products are based 
over the past year  the company has experienced supply related issues including insufficient allocation of manufacturing capacity  yield issues and difficulties of its partner to successfully transition to a next generation manufacturing technology 
these problems have had a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations which the company expects will continue into fiscal the company s products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
the company does not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
such assembly and testing is conducted on a purchase order basis 
as a result of its reliance on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products  the company cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacturing or assembly of the company s products 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors  product shipments could be delayed significantly if the company were required to find alternative subcontractors 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of the assembly and test of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory risk under its wafer supply agreements with mitsubishi electric  toshiba and infineon  the company is obligated to provide rolling month forecasts of anticipated purchases and to place binding purchase orders three to four months prior to shipment from the suppliers 
the company expects that its revenues will decline significantly from the prior year s revenue and accordingly is monitoring its inventory levels for product on hand and on order 
the company orders wafers for deliveries at least months in advance and with the additional time to assemble and test wafers  the company can have orders for finished goods that will be available up to six months into the future 
if the company does not have sufficient demand for its products and cannot cancel its current and future commitments without material impact  the company may experience excess inventory  which will result in a write off affecting gross margin and results of operations 
if the company cancels a purchase order  it must pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
forecasts of monthly purchases may not increase or decrease by more than a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast without the manufacturer s consent 
thus  the company must make forecasts and place purchase orders for wafers long before it receives purchase orders from its own customers 
this limits the company s ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products  which can be unexpected and dramatic  and from time to time will cause the company to have an excess or shortage of wafers for a particular product 
also  many of the company s customers are moving to just in time relationships with their vendors  which can shift the risk of carrying inventory back to the supplier 
as a result of the long lead time for manufacturing wafers and the increase in just in time ordering by pc manufacturers  semiconductor companies such as the company from time to time must take charges for excess inventory 
significant write offs of excess inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  failure to order sufficient wafers would cause the company to miss revenue opportunities and  if significant  could impact sales by the company s customers  which could adversely affect the company s customer relationships and thereby materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at january   the company has issued outstanding purchase orders totaling over million with its manufacturing partners for the delivery of wafers over the next five months 
if orders from neomagic s customers do not meet the company s expectations  the company may be required to incur cancellation charges related to the purchase orders with its manufacturing partners and or charges for the write off of excess inventory 
manufacturing yields the fabrication of semiconductors is a complex and precise process 
because neomagic s products feature the integration of large dram memory with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip  a manufacturer must obtain acceptable yields of both the memory and logic portions of such products  compounding the complexity of the manufacturing process 
as a result  the company may face greater manufacturing challenges than its competitors 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
as a result  semiconductor companies often experience problems in achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  which are represented by the number of good die as a proportion of the total number of die on any particular wafer 
the company purchases wafers  not die  and pays an agreed upon price for wafers meeting certain acceptance criteria 
accordingly  the company bears the risk of the yield of good die from wafers purchased meeting the acceptance criteria 
the company is currently experiencing such yield problems which has affected  and is expected to continue to  materially adversely affect the company s net sales  gross margins and results of operations in fiscal semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design  which is developed largely by the company  and process technology  which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
historically  the company has experienced lower yields on new products 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between the company and the manufacturer 
for example  a design error that resulted in lower than expected yields of finished products caused the company to take a million charge in fiscal this risk is compounded by the offshore location of the company s manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required identifying  communicating and resolving manufacturing yield problems 
as the company s relationships with new manufacturing partners develop  yields could be adversely affected due to difficulties associated with adopting the company s technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of each manufacturer 
any significant decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in the company s per unit product cost and could force the company to allocate its available product supply among its customers  potentially adversely impacting customer relationships as well as revenues and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturers will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
the inability of the company to achieve planned yields from its manufacturer for its newest product  the magicmediaxl  has had  and is expected to continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company s net sales  gross margins and results of operations in fiscal dependence on new product development  rapid technological change the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will depend to a significant extent on its ability to maintain its position in the market for multimedia accelerator products that integrate large dram with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip 
as a result  the company believes that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the notebook pc market for which the company s products are designed is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
notebook pc manufacturers demand products incorporating rich features and functionality in order to achieve product differentiation 
the company must anticipate the features and functionality that the consumer of notebook pcs will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of the notebook pc manufacturers  price its products competitively  and introduce the products to the market on a timely basis 
for example  d has become increasingly important for notebook pcs 
the company s ability to compete may depend on its ability to incorporate these features in its products 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability of strategic manufacturing partners to effectively design and implement the manufacture of new products  quality of new products  differentiation of new products from those of the company s competitors and market acceptance of neomagic s and its customers products 
there can be no assurance that the products the company expects to introduce will incorporate the features and functionality demanded by system manufacturers and consumers of notebook pcs  will be successfully developed  or will be introduced within the appropriate window of market demand 
the company is currently unable to successfully introduce its new products and achieve market acceptance for such products at the appropriate cost and feature set within the window of market demand 
this situation will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in fiscal the integration of large dram memory with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip is highly complex and is critical to the company s success 
because of the complexity of its products  however  neomagic has experienced delays from time to time in completing development and introduction of new products 
in the event that there are delays in the completion of development of future products  including the products currently expected to be announced over the next year  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
although the development cycles for the memory and logic portions of the company s products have been relatively synchronized to date  there can be no assurance that this synchronization will continue in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that fundamental advances in either the memory or logic components of the company s products will not significantly increase the complexity inherent in the design and manufacture of the company s products  rendering the company s product technologically infeasible or uncompetitive 
the multiple chip solutions offered by some of the company s competitors are less complex to design and manufacture than the company s integrated products 
as a result  these competitive solutions may be less expensive  particularly during periods of depressed dram prices 
the time required for competitors to develop and introduce competing products may be shorter and manufacturing yields may be better than those experienced by the company 
as the markets for the company s products continue to develop and competition increases  neomagic anticipates that product life cycles will shorten and average selling prices will decline 
in particular  average selling prices and  in some cases  gross margin for each of the company s products will decline as the products mature 
thus  the company will need to continue introducing compelling new products at relatively higher average selling prices in order to maintain overall average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring to market new products in a timely manner 
the company is currently experiencing difficulties in bringing its latest product to market which will have a material adverse impact on neomagic s business  financial condition and results of operations for fiscal further  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render neomagic s products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive  or that the company s products will be selected for new designs by its customers 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary rights the company relies in part on patents to protect its intellectual property 
the company has been issued numerous patents worldwide  each covering certain aspects of the design and architecture of the company s multimedia accelerators 
in fiscal  the company also acquired and or licensed intellectual properties  the majority of which were in the areas of mixed signal analog design and array based processing as part of the february acquisitions of the optical drive development group and acl 
additionally  the company and its newly acquired businesses have patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications  or any future applications will be approved 
further  there can be no assurance that any issued patents will provide the company with significant intellectual property protection  competitive advantages  or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or design around any patents that may be issued to the company 
the company also relies on a combination of mask work protection  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that the company can meaningfully protect its intellectual property 
a failure by the company to meaningfully protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation  regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in december  the company filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against trident microsystems  inc the suit alleges that trident s embedded dram graphics accelerators infringe certain patents held by the company 
in january  trident filed a counter claim against the company alleging an attempted monopolization in violation of antitrust laws  arising from neomagic s filing of the patent infringement action against trident in december 
the court has stayed all litigation concerning trident s antitrust claim pending resolution of neomagic s claim for patent infringement 
the patent infringement claim is scheduled for trial to commence on july  management believes the company has valid defenses against trident s claims 
in february  cirrus logic inc cirrus logic sent the company written notice asserting that the company s magicgraph  magicgraphv and magicgraphzv products infringe six united states patents held by cirrus logic 
since receiving the notice of alleged infringement  the company has advised cirrus logic that the company does not believe that any of its products infringe any claims of the patents 
the company also has undergone a confidential external infringement review and has conducted its own internal infringement review  and the company continues to believe that the cirrus logic infringement allegations are unfounded 
however  there can be no assurances that cirrus logic will not file a lawsuit against the company or that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
any protracted litigation by cirrus logic or the success of cirrus logic in any such litigation could have a material and adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
any patent litigation  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that current or future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by other customers or end users of the company s products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  or to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on international sales and suppliers export sales are a critical part of the company s business 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of the company s net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company expects that net sales derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales 
letters of credit issued by customers support a portion of the company s international sales 
to date  the company s international sales have been denominated in united states dollars 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of the company s customers could make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products sold in the customer s local currency 
international manufacturers produce all of the company s wafers 
in addition  many of the assembly and test services used by the company are procured from international sources 
under the company s wafer supply agreements with mitsubishi electric and toshiba  wafers are priced in japanese yen 
as a result  the company s costs of goods sold are subject to fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rates 
the company has in the past hedged its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate by purchasing foreign exchange contracts and will continue to do so in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such hedging will be adequate 
the company experienced such fluctuations during fiscal which has negatively impacted the company s gross margin and results of operations 
significant wafer or assembly and test service price increases  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the company s inability to fully hedge against currency exchange rate fluctuations could continue to have a material and sudden adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally including foreign government regulation  political and economic instability  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of piracy of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need for additional capital the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through the next months  although the company could be required  or could elect  to seek to raise additional capital during such period 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of net sales growth  timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs in new and existing areas of technology  expansion of sales and marketing support activities  and timing and customer acceptance for new products and enhancements to existing products 
the company may raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
management of expanded operations the company has experienced periods of rapid growth and expansion both domestically and internationally  which have placed a significant strain on the company s limited personnel and other resources 
to manage these expanded operations effectively  including the operations of recently acquired entities in the uk  and israel  the company will be required to continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems 
the company is dependent upon its ability to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage its employees  especially its management and development personnel 
if the company s management is unable to manage its expanded operations effectively  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on qualified personnel the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  finance and executive personnel  and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and train qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company s forthcoming restructuring is expected to place increased demands on the company s resources and will likely require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the company has experienced the loss of certain personnel and also anticipates including additional reductions of personnel in its restructuring charge 
if the company s headcount is not appropriate for its future direction and the company fails to recruit key personnel critical to its future direction in a timely manner  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other semiconductor companies  has been and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors  including quarter to quarter variations in the company s anticipated or actual operating results  announcements of new products  technological innovations or setbacks by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor and pc industries  unanticipated shifts in the notebook pc market or industry standards  loss of key customers  changes in dram pricing  litigation commencement or developments  changes in or the failure by the company to meet estimates of the company s performance by securities analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  and other events or factors 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
since the company s announcement of its expectation of declining revenues  gross margins and operating results  the market price of the common stock has been and is expected to be for some time in the future  materially adversely affected
