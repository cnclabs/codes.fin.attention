item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the original statistical package for the social sciences was introduced in  and spss was incorporated in the first spss products were almost exclusively used by academic researchers working on mainframe systems 
spss has subsequently transformed and enhanced its core product technology  broadened its customer base into the corporate and government sectors  significantly expanded its sales and marketing capabilities  acquired ten corporate entities and product offerings  and adapted its products to changing hardware and software technologies 
approximately of revenues came from sales to customers in corporate settings  with another in academic institutions and in government agencies 
in recent years  spss has experienced a significant shift in the sources of its revenues 
between and  revenues from its analytical solutions increased from less than to over of total net revenues and market research revenues rose from to 
in contrast  revenue from spss statistical products and services declined from to of net revenues 
management expects these trends to continue in results of operations the following table shows select statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the years indicated 
net revenues analytic solutions market research statistics net revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing product development general and administrative special general and administrative charges merger related acquired in process technology operating expenses operating income net interest income expense other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of twelve months ended december   and net revenues 
net revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of from  and to  in  and an increase of from these increases were primarily due to growth in analytical solutions revenues of in and in  as well as increases in market research revenues of in and in growth in analytical solutions revenues in was primarily due to the introduction of new data mining products  while such increases in were primarily due to additional new data mining products and sales of the newly acquired clementine products 
growth in market research revenues in was primarily due to sales of the telephony product for data collection  while such increases in were primarily due to the introduction of a new web data collection product  revenues from the newly acquired surveycraft products and an increased number of large transactions with major customers 
offsetting this revenue growth were increases in statistics revenue of in and in  primarily due to shifts in sales and marketing resources toward developing the higher growth markets for analytical solutions  as well as reflecting the lower overall growth rate in the market for general purpose statistical products 
revenues were adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates for the three years described 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of costs of goods sold  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and royalties paid to third parties

in november  spss acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of surveycraft  a provider of market research software in the pacific rim 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with the project had not reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use other than as market research software 
spss carefully assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
future cash flows were projected over five years discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
spss believes the discount rate is appropriate given the level of risk of unsuccessful completion of the technology as it was estimated to be approximately complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting the future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage which spss could provide to the surveycraft products 
in december  spss acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of integral solutions  a leading provider of data mining software

net interest income expense 
net interest income was  in and  in primarily due to interest earned on short term investments 
net interest expense was  in primarily due to interest expense incurred on the line of credit 
other income expense 
other income expense consists mainly of foreign exchange transactions 
the foreign exchange amounts were  in   in and  in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes consisted of  in   in and  in during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of  excluding the effect of japanese withholding taxes on monies transferred out of japan in  and the non deductibility of some quantime expenses 
during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of approximately  excluding the effect of japanese withholding taxes on monies transferred out of japan in  and certain expenses related to the surveycraft and integral solutions acquisitions 
during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of approximately  excluding the effect of japanese monies transferred out of japan in liquidity and capital resources the company s long term debt as of december  is a mortgage on property in the united kingdom  and the balance of the purchase price due to datastat  sa for the acquisition of the verbastat product 
as of december   spss held approximately  of cash 
funds in were used primarily for payments related to the company s acquisitions  as well as for capital expenditures including  new computer systems for use in internal product development  and leasehold improvements and furnishings for the company s new office space in the sears tower in chicago  illinois 
funds in were used primarily for payments related to spss acquisitions  as well as new computer systems for use in internal product development and expenditures made for an office move in sweden 
in june  spss revised its loan agreement with american national bank and trust company of chicago 
under the new loan agreement  spss has an available  unsecured line of credit with american national  under which borrowings bear interest at either the prime interest rate or the eurodollar rate  depending on the circumstances 
as of december   spss had  outstanding under this line of credit 
the company s agreement with american national requires spss to comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests  and  among other things  restricts the company s ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o create liens on assets  o make investments  o engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations where spss is not the surviving entity  o sell assets  o engage in select transactions with affiliates  and o amend its organizational documents or make changes in its capital structure  and also requires spss to be year compliant in software and other information processing capabilities 
also in june  spss entered into an amendment to the loan agreement with american national 
this amendment makes an additional  available to spss for the acquisition of assets and further requires that spss meet all original requirements of the loan agreement and give american national the opportunity to use any proceeds from a public offering of equity or debt securities to retire outstanding amounts on the line of credit 
spss anticipates the amounts available from cash and cash equivalents on hand  under its line of credit  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  no assurance can be given that changing business circumstances will not require additional capital for reasons that are not currently anticipated or that the necessary additional capital will then be available to spss on favorable terms or at all 
the company s capital expenditures  primarily for computer systems and office furniture totaled approximately  in and are projected to total approximately  in and  in capital expenditures during will include new computers  primarily for use in internal product development  replacement of its systems for accounting and order entry  as well as furnishings and other equipment related to the move of the company s facilities in kilburn  uk  and expansion of facilities in chicago  miami  woking  uk  denmark  and australia 
spss does not believe that the implementation of its business strategy will require substantial additional capital expenditures in comparison with historical levels of product development costs and other expenses 
international operations significant growth in the company s international operations also occurred from to revenues from international operations comprised approximately to of total net revenues between and they were approximately of total net revenues in following the reorganization of its international operations in  spss has maintained substantially the same direct sales and telesales organizations worldwide 
the international sales organization uses more independent distributors than does the domestic sales organization  primarily in countries without an spss sales office 
management believes the profit margins associated with the company s domestic and international operations are essentially the same 
as international revenues increase  spss may experience additional foreign currency exchange risk 
to mitigate these effects  spss hedges its transaction exposure ie  the effect on earnings and cash flows of changes in foreign exchange rates on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
spss does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
accordingly  the company s reported revenues and net income have been and in the future may be affected by the changes in foreign exchange rates 
year the company spent approximately million to address issues with the year date change 
the company has not experienced business disruption or incurred significant expenses in related to the date change
