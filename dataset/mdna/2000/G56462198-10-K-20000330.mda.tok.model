compared with operating segment revenues for loral were billion for versus billion in  before intercompany and affiliate eliminations of million in and million in the increase in revenues was due primarily to growth in fixed satellite services as a result of the service start up of satmex in january  loral skynet s telstar satellite in march and the acquisition of telstar apstar iir in september  increased growth in broadband data services  partially due to the acquisition of global access services in july  and increases in satellite manufacturing and technology 
also contributing to increased revenues was the inclusion of loral cyberstar s leasing and data businesses for the full year in versus nine months in and other increased revenues at satmex  primarily from the sale of three transponders to loral skynet 
the increase in affiliate eliminations in reflects higher revenues for satmex 
ebitda for operating segments before development and start up costs and affiliate and intercompany eliminations  increased in to million from million in this increase arose primarily from growth in fixed satellite services due to the initiation of service on satellites added to our fss fleet in  increased margins in broadband data services  and increases at satmex  primarily from the sale of three transponders to loral skynet 
in addition  satellite manufacturing and technology s ebitda grew million to million in  before a million charge relating to an agreement reached with chinasat to extend the delivery date of a satellite and other modifications to the contract in return for satellite capacity on another company owned satellite 
after considering the charge  satellite manufacturing and technology s ebitda was million in versus million in the net charge to loral was million  after considering the cost of the owned transponders and  as a result  intercompany eliminations were reduced by million 
total investment in development and start up costs increased in to million  from costs of million 
while the investment required for cyberstar lp decreased to million in from million in  costs related to the further development of globalstar rose to million in from million in  resulting from increased costs for the development of user terminals and in house engineering  marketing  general and administrative costs in anticipation of the start of service and launch related costs 
affiliate eliminations increased in  primarily as a result of globalstar s increased development and start up costs 
as a result of the above  ebitda as reported increased to million in from million in depreciation and amortization rose to million in from million in  and excludes depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated affiliates of million and million for and  respectively  primarily for satmex 
the increase primarily results from the depreciation of satellites placed in service in  including telstar  telstar  telstar  and telstar apstar iir and the inclusion of loral cyberstar s depreciation and the amortization of cost in excess of loral cyberstar s net assets acquired for the full year in interest and investment income increased to million in from million in  principally due to million of non cash income related to warrants received in connection with globalstar s credit agreement see acquisitions and investments in affiliates and million of dividend income from loral s investment in gtl preferred stock in january interest expense was million in  net of capitalized interest of million  versus million in  net of capitalized interest of million 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to including interest expense for loral cyberstar for a full year in  interest expense on the company s senior notes issued in january and increased interest expense on loral spacecom corporation s credit facility  due to higher rates and amounts outstanding in  partially offset by increased capitalized interest in capitalized interest is expected to be lower in  due to the start of globalstar telephone service in the first quarter of and the successful launches in of telstar  telstar and telstar in  the company realized a million gain on the sale of gtl common stock  which was mostly offset by the write off of non strategic investments in asia broadcasting and communications network  ltd 
and continental satellite corporation of million  which were determined to have no future value to loral 
these items resulted in a net gain on investments of million in for  the income tax benefit of million included a non recurring tax benefit of million relating to a tax law change affecting the future utilization of loral cyberstar s pre acquisition loss carryforwards 
excluding this non recurring benefit  the company recorded an income tax provision of million on a loss before income taxes of million 
for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on a loss of million before income taxes 
in comparing to  the change is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income from non taxable jurisdictions in the minority interest benefit primarily reflects the reduction of cyberstar lp s loss attributed to cyberstar lp s other investor  who owned as of december  the equity in net loss of affiliates was million in compared to million in loral s share of globalstar s losses  net of the related tax benefits  was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to globalstar s increased development costs and marketing  general and administrative costs in and launch related costs of million in related to excess launch capacity 
as a result of its successful launch campaign during  globalstar does not anticipate using all the excess launch vehicle capacity it had contracted for and  accordingly  recorded a charge of million 
globalstar has a remaining deposit balance of million relating to backup launch capacity for three additional launches 
in  globalstar incurred a million charge related to the loss of satellites on launch failure 
loral s share of satmex s loss was million for  after eliminating the profit on its sale of three transponders to loral skynet  and million for also included as equity in net loss of affiliates is loral s share of europe star s losses  skybridge limited partnership s losses  and losses from other affiliates  including million  net of related tax benefits  principally related to loral s proportionate share of the reduction in the carrying value of the transponders of the mabuhay space holdings limited joint venture see note to loral s consolidated financial statements

as a result of the above  the net loss applicable to common stockholders for was million or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share for basic and diluted weighted average shares were million for and million for see note to loral s consolidated financial statements 
this increase is primarily due to the million shares issued to the public in june and the million shares issued to acquire loral cyberstar in march compared with total revenues for loral s operating segments were billion for versus billion in  before intercompany and affiliate eliminations of million in and million in the increase in revenues was due primarily to growth in fixed satellite services as a result of including satmex for the full year  loral cyberstar s leasing business for nine months  loral skynet s results for a full year in versus nine and a half months in and increased utilization of loral skynet s telstar satellites 
the growth in fixed satellite services was partially offset by a modest decline in satellite manufacturing revenues which primarily resulted from the debooking of three satellites for asian customers at the end of the increase in affiliate eliminations in reflects the elimination of a full year of satmex sales 
the increase in intercompany eliminations in primarily reflects increased investment in satellite construction by ss l for loral s fss segment 
ebitda for operating segments before development and start up costs  and intercompany and affiliate eliminations  increased in to million from million in  a year over year increase of 
this increase arose primarily from the growth in fixed satellite services due to increased utilization of loral skynet s telstar satellites  the inclusion of loral skynet s results for a full year in versus nine and a half months in  including the results of loral cyberstar s leasing business subsequent to its acquisition  and including satmex s results for a full year in and growth in satellite manufacturing and technology from increased margins 
these increases were partially offset by including the results of loral cyberstar s broadband data services business in and increased corporate expenses  which resulted primarily from costs incurred for the additional resources required to manage the substantial growth in loral s businesses  along with increased legal and other costs in support of the company s operations 
total development and start up costs rose substantially in to million  a increase over spending of million 
while the investment required for cyberstar lp remained constant year over year at approximately million  costs related to the further development of globalstar rose to million in from million in  due to increased activities in anticipation of the commencement of commercial service 
affiliate eliminations decreased in primarily as a result of eliminating a full year of satmex s results for versus one and a half months in  partially offset by the elimination of increased globalstar costs and europe star costs in intercompany eliminations increased in primarily from increased investment in satellite construction by ss l for loral s fss segment 
as a result of the above  ebitda as reported increased to million in from million in depreciation and amortization rose to million in from million in  and excludes depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated affiliates of million and million for and  respectively  primarily for satmex 
the increase primarily results from the inclusion of loral cyberstar s depreciation and the amortization of cost in excess of its net assets acquired and from the inclusion of loral skynet s depreciation and amortization for a full year in  which includes the depreciation of loral skynet s telstar satellite which was placed in service on july  interest and investment income increased to million in from million in this increase is principally due to including loral cyberstar s interest income in  partially offset by lower cash balances available for investment in interest expense of million in  net of capitalized interest of million  reflects interest on borrowings under loral spacecom corporation s credit facility  other loral debt and interest on loral cyberstar s debt subsequent to its acquisition 
interest expense of million in  net of capitalized interest of million  reflects interest on ss l s debt assumed and interest on loral s outstanding convertible preferred equivalent obligations cpeos 
on june   the cpeos were exchanged for the series c preferred stock 
loral realized a million gain on the sale of gtl common stock  which was mostly offset by the write off of non strategic investments in asia broadcasting and communications network  ltd 
and in continental satellite corporation of million  which were determined to have no future value to loral 
these items resulted in a net gain on investments of million in in  the company realized a gain on investment of million resulting from the sale of the stock of k f industries  inc k f  net of expenses 
for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of on its loss before income taxes  while for  the company recorded an income tax provision of on income before income taxes 
the benefit rate for is lower than the provision rate for primarily because of the loral cyberstar non deductible amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired in the current year 
the minority interest benefit in primarily reflects the reduction of cyberstar lp s loss attributed to cyberstar lp s other investor  who owned as of december  the minority interest expense in also reflects the reduction of ss l s income attributed to other partners partial ownership in ss l until loral acquired the remaining in february  as compared to loral s full ownership of ss l in for the entire year 
the equity in net loss of affiliates was million in compared to million in loral s share of globalstar s losses was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to globalstar s increased development and start up costs and loral s increased ownership percentage in globalstar in as of december  versus as of december  and loral s proportionate share of a charge taken by globalstar in as a result of a zenit launch failure

segregated cash increased as of december   as a result of receiving the insurance proceeds from the orion launch failure 
fixed satellite services loral skynet loral skynet currently has four high power satellites in orbit  including telstar  which was launched in september aboard an ariane launch vehicle and started revenue generating service in november loral intends to expand loral skynet s business to become a worldwide satellite service provider through the construction of additional satellites 
loral cyberstar loral cyberstar currently has three satellites in orbit telstar  telstar and telstar apstar iir 
telstar  originally intended to operate at degrees wl  was launched aboard an ariane launch vehicle in october into the orbital slot located at degrees wl  and commenced operations in january under an agreement reached with eutelsat  loral cyberstar agreed to operate telstar at degrees wl while eutelsat continues to develop its services at degrees wl eutelsat has in turn agreed not to use its degrees wl orbital slot and to assert its priority rights at such location on loral cyberstar s behalf 
as part of this coordination effort  loral cyberstar agreed to provide to eutelsat four mhz transponders on telstar for the life of the satellite 
eutelsat also has the right to acquire  at cost  four transponders on the next replacement satellite for telstar as part of the international coordination process  loral continues to conduct discussions with various administrations regarding telstar s operations at degrees wl if these discussions are not successful  telstar s useable capacity may be reduced 
on may   the orion satellite was placed into a lower than expected orbit after its launch on a delta iii rocket 
according to boeing  the delta iii rocket apparently failed to complete its second stage burn  and  as a result  the satellite  manufactured by hughes space and communications corporation  achieved an orbit well below the planned final altitude 
as a result  the satellite cannot be used for its intended purpose 
the satellite and launch were fully insured for approximately million  which was received in the third quarter of dacom corporation  a korean communications company which had purchased eight transponders on orion for a total of million  had made prepayments of approximately million to the company 
under the agreement with dacom  the amount prepaid was refunded in july to replace orion  on september   loral cyberstar purchased from apt satellite company limited apt the rights to all transponder capacity and existing customer leases on the apstar iir satellite except for one c band transponder retained by apt  and renamed the satellite the telstar apstar iir satellite  for approximately million 
telstar apstar iir  which was manufactured by ss l  was launched in october and as of september   had an expected remaining useful life of years 
loral cyberstar has full use of the transponders for the remaining life of telstar apstar iir 
located at degrees el  telstar apstar iir covers a region that includes asia  europe  africa and australia  which represents over of the world s population 
under the purchase agreement  loral cyberstar will also have the option to lease from apt replacement satellites upon the end of life of telstar apstar iir 
as of december   loral cyberstar had made payments of approximately million to apt and paid approximately million in march insurance proceeds from the orion failure were used to fund the initial payments made and a significant portion of the final payment 
based upon its current expectations for growth  loral cyberstar anticipates it will have additional funding requirements over the next three years to fund the purchase of vsats  senior note interest payments  other capital expenditures and other operating needs 
interest charges on the senior notes are fully provided for by restricted cash through july loral cyberstar does not have a revolving credit facility 
accordingly  loral cyberstar will need to secure funding from loral  or raise additional financing 
sources of additional capital may include public or private debt  equity financings or strategic investments 
to the extent that loral cyberstar seeks to raise additional debt financing  its indentures limit the amount of such additional debt and prohibit loral cyberstar from using telstar  telstar and telstar apstar iir as collateral for indebtedness for money borrowed 
if loral cyberstar requires additional financing and is unable to obtain such financing from loral or from outside sources in the amounts and at the times needed  there would be a material adverse effect on loral cyberstar 
satmex satmex currently has three satellites in orbit satmex  solidaridad and solidaridad and one satellite in inclined orbit morelos 
on april   solidaridad experienced a loss of its primary satellite control processor 
service was restored after hours  using the backup satellite control processor 
failure of the backup satellite control processor would result in the loss of solidaridad  which would be fully covered by insurance 
on march   satmex redeemed million of its secured floating rate notes using proceeds from the sale of preferred stock 
on september   satmex redeemed an additional million of its secured floating rate notes 
the related covenants of such debt restrict the ability of satmex to pay dividends to loral 
on february   satmex obtained amendments to certain of its debt agreements which adjust certain financial covenants 
as a result  satmex believes that its future operating cash flow and the availability of its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service its interest and debt repayment requirements and ensure compliance with its debt agreements 
broadband data services loral s broadband strategy will build on its existing resources to address both the expanding market for today s broadband services and to become a leading medium for delivery of even richer internet content in the future 
the company s initial focus will be on two attractive opportunities for early market entry consumer broadband services and streaming media services 
consumer broadband services 
the company plans to serve the growing consumer broadband services market  initially in north america  with an affordable  ubiquitous  two way  high speed internet access service employing a hybrid satellite fiber network 
when fully deployed  this network will be capable of serving at least ten million homes and small businesses at downstream connection speeds of up to megabits per second 
in addition  the system will offer streaming multimedia in multicast mode at speeds of up to megabits per second and at upstream connection speeds of at least kilobits per second 
the company intends to serve as the wholesaler of this connectivity service to isps  cable companies  and telephone companies who will market and sell the service to their customers as a high value extra feature in their own portfolio of services 
the company currently estimates that the required investment for the consumer broadband services business in north america will be approximately billion  with the services implemented and the associated investments made in several phases 
streaming media services 
the company intends to exploit the technical advantages of satellites to deliver streaming media services more effectively than terrestrial alternatives 
instead of flooding the internet with multiple point to point transmissions of these massive files  the company s system will move content directly from its source via satellite to multiple servers located at the edge of the net  near the end user 
this should eliminate bottlenecks  improve quality  lower cost and expand content choices and applications 
the company plans to focus its marketing efforts initially on its existing base of isp and corporate customers 
the company intends to enter three streaming media business segments transport services to the edge of the net for content and applications service providers  content aggregation services for customers wishing to outsource their streaming media distribution process  and development of a portal tailored for businesses 
the company currently estimates the required investment for the streaming media services business at approximately million 
the company is seeking strategic partners to enhance the establishment and prospects of both the planned consumer broadband and streaming media businesses 
the company expects that such third party strategic partners will bear a significant portion of the costs of these projects 
satellite manufacturing and technology ss l due to the long lead times required to produce purchased parts and launch vehicles  the company has entered into various purchase commitments with suppliers 
these commitments aggregated approximately million as of december  global mobile telephone service globalstar in january  globalstar sold to gtl seven million units face amount of per unit of convertible redeemable preferred partnership interests rppis  in connection with gtl s offering of seven million shares face amount of per share of gtl series a convertible redeemable preferred stock the gtl series a preferred stock 
the gtl series a preferred stock is convertible into shares of gtl common stock at a conversion price of per share 
loral purchased three million shares or million face amount of the gtl series a preferred stock offered 
dividends on the rppis and the gtl series a preferred stock accrue at per annum and are payable quarterly 
in july  globalstar and gtl filed a shelf registration statement the shelf registration statement with the sec covering up to million of securities 
under the shelf registration statement  globalstar may  from time to time  offer debt securities  which may be either senior or subordinated or secured or unsecured and gtl may  from time to time  offer shares of common stock  preferred stock or warrants  all at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
on august   globalstar entered into a million credit agreement with a group of banks for the build out of the globalstar system  of which million was outstanding at december  the credit facility is guaranteed by loral satcom ltd 
and loral satellite  inc  wholly owned subsidiaries of loral 
the guarantee is secured by the pledge of certain assets of loral and its subsidiaries  including the stock of the guarantors and the telstar and telstar satellites 
based on third party valuations  management believes that the fair value of telstar and telstar is in excess of this million credit agreement 
as of december   the net book value of telstar and telstar was million 
the guarantee agreement contains customary financial covenants of the guarantors  including maintenance of a minimum collateral coverage ratio and maintenance of a combined minimum net worth and combined ebitda 
in addition  the guarantee agreement contains customary limitations on indebtedness  liens  fundamental changes  asset sales  dividends except that the guarantors may pay dividends to their parents provided that combined aggregate cash on hand at the guarantors is at least equal to million and the guarantors hold an intercompany note due from loral for at least million  investments  capital expenditures  creating liens other than those created pursuant to the guarantee and transactions with affiliates 
in consideration for the guarantee  loral received warrants to purchase  globalstar partnership interests at an exercise price of per interest  which were valued at million based on the guarantee provided 
the exercise price was determined by reference to the fair market value of gtl s common stock on the closing date of the credit agreement  based on an approximate one partnership interest for four shares of gtl common stock exchange ratio 
of the warrants vested in february assuming the guarantee remains in effect  an additional will vest in august with the remaining vesting in august the warrants expire in globalstar may call the warrants after august  if gtl s common stock price exceeds for a defined period 
in december  gtl completed a private offering of million of series b convertible redeemable preferred stock the gtl series b preferred stock 
gtl used the net proceeds from this offering to purchase series b convertible redeemable preferred partnership interests rppis of globalstar  the terms of which are generally similar to the terms of the gtl series b preferred stock 
globalstar in turn is using such proceeds for the cost of the continued deployment of the globalstar system and for general corporate purposes 
in february  gtl sold  shares of its common stock to the public under the shelf registration statement 
gtl used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million to purchase  ordinary partnership interests in globalstar 
globalstar intends to use the offering proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the acceleration of globalstar s roll out through increased support for service provider marketing activities and the funding of promotional discounts  development of new service features  and possible repayment of debt 
ss l has provided million of billings deferred under its construction contracts with globalstar  comprised of million of orbital incentives  of which million was repaid in and million is expected to be repaid in  million of vendor financing which bears interest at libor plus and is repayable over five years commencing in  and million of non interest bearing vendor financing  due over five years in equal monthly installments  commencing in ss l s terms with its subcontractors include million of financing assumed by them  which is to be repaid on substantially similar terms of which a portion is non recourse to ss l in the event of non payment by globalstar 
in the first quarter of  globalstar commenced commercial service 
pursuant to the globalstar partnership agreement  loral is entitled to receive a managing partner s allocation of of globalstar s annual revenues under million and of annual revenues in excess of million 
such allocation is reduced by to the extent globalstar has a net loss in any given year 
globalstar expects to spend million for the enhancement of its system software  for the eight spare satellites being constructed by ss l  and for financing provided to globalstar s service providers to assist in the purchase of gateways  fixed access terminals and handsets of which million is expected to be received from the service providers as repayment of such financing 
in addition  cash interest  preferred dividends and operating costs are expected to be approximately million per quarter in globalstar believes that its cash on hand million at february   available credit under its two credit facilities and vendor financing arrangements approximately million at february   service revenues and other anticipated cash inflows will be sufficient to cover its expected cash outflows provided that its million credit facility is renegotiated 
if globalstar cannot renegotiate its million credit facility  it believes it will be able to obtain additional funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funds will be available on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
qualcomm incorporated qualcomm has agreed to provide globalstar million of vendor financing for which the terms of million are still being finalized 
in connection with the agreement  qualcomm is expected to receive warrants to purchase globalstar partnership interests comparable to those received by loral pursuant to loral s guarantee of globalstar s million credit facility see above 
commitments and contingencies in connection with the merger between loral corporation and lockheed martin  lockheed martin assumed approximately million of the guarantee under globalstar s million credit agreement 
the balance of million of the guarantee was assumed by various globalstar partners  including million by ss l 
loral has agreed to indemnify lockheed martin for its liability  if any  in excess of million under its guarantee of the million globalstar credit agreement 
loral had a million secured standby bank credit facility  which was undrawn as of december   supporting a guarantee of a million term loan of an unaffiliated third party 
the term loan was repaid by the unaffiliated third party on february   resulting in the expiration of the standby credit facility 
prior to its acquisition by loral  loral skynet sold several transponders under which title to specific transponders was transferred to the customer 
under the terms of the sales contracts  loral skynet continues to operate the satellites on which the transponders are located and provides a warranty for a period of to years 
depending on the contract  loral skynet is required to replace any transponders failing to meet operating specifications 
all customers are entitled to a refund equal to the reimbursement value  as defined  in the event there is no replacement 
the reimbursement value is determined based on the original purchase price plus an interest factor from the time the payment was received to acceptance of the transponder by the customer  reduced on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
in case of satellite failure  the reimbursement value may be paid from proceeds received from insurance policies 
in  two satellites built by ss l experienced solar array circuit failures 
ss l settled one of the customer s claims in and the other customer s claims in in late  following the launch of an ss l built satellite sold to panamsat  a manufacturing error was discovered that affected the geographical coverage of the ku band transponders on the satellite 
on january   panamsat filed an arbitration proceeding in connection with this error claiming damages of million for lost profits  and increased sales and marketing costs 
ss l believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and that its liability is limited to a loss of a portion of the applicable orbital incentives  the estimated impact of which is included in loral s consolidated financial statements 
panamsat has received a recovery from its insurance carrier that should reduce any damage claim 
while this proceeding is in its very early stages  management believes that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of loral 
ss l is a target of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia with respect to possible violations of export control laws that may have occurred in connection with the participation of ss l employees on a committee formed in the wake of the crash of a long march rocket in china and whose purpose was to consider whether studies of the crash made by the chinese had correctly identified the cause of the failure 
the company is not in a position to predict the direction or outcome of the investigation 
if ss l were to be indicted and convicted of a criminal violation of the arms export control act  it would be subject to a fine of million per violation and could be debarred from certain export privileges and  possibly  from participation in government contracts 
since many of ss l s satellites are built for foreign customers and or launched on foreign rockets  such a debarment would have a material adverse effect on ss l s business  and therefore the company 
indictment for such violations would subject ss l to discretionary debarment from further export licenses 
under the applicable regulations  ss l could be debarred from export privileges without being convicted of any crime if it is indicted for these alleged violations  and loss of export privileges would harm ss l s business 
whether or not ss l is indicted or convicted  ss l remains subject to the state department s general statutory authority to prohibit exports of satellites and related services if it finds a violation of the arms export control act that puts ss l s reliability in question  and it can suspend export privileges whenever it determines that grounds for debarment exist and that such suspension is reasonably necessary to protect world peace or the security or foreign policy of the united states 
as far as ss l can determine  no sensitive information or technology was conveyed to the chinese  and no secret or classified information was discussed with or reported to them 
ss l believes that its employees acted openly and in good faith and that none engaged in intentional misconduct 
accordingly  the company does not believe that ss l has committed a criminal violation of the export control laws 
the company does not expect the grand jury investigation or its outcome to result in a material adverse effect upon its business 
however  there can be no assurance as to these conclusions 
on december   the office of defense trade controls odtc of the us department of state temporarily suspended the previously approved technical assistance agreement under which ss l had been preparing for the launch of the chinasat satellite 
according to odtc  the purpose of the temporary suspension is to permit that agency to review the agreement for conformity with newly enacted legislation section of the arms export control act with respect to the export of missile equipment or technology 
ss l has complied with odtc s instructions  and believes that a review of the agreement will show that its terms comply with the new law 
the odtc  however  has not yet completed its review  and the scheduled launch date for chinasat is being delayed 
in december  loral reached an agreement with chinasat to extend the date for delivery of the chinasat satellite to july  in return for this extension and other modifications to the contract  loral has agreed to provide to the customer two mhz and one mhz transponders on telstar apstar iir for the life of those transponders 
as a result  the company recorded a net charge to earnings of million 
if the suspension is not lifted by july   chinasat could decide to terminate the contract 
if such a termination were to occur  ss l would have to refund advances received from chinasat million as of december  and may incur penalties of up to million and believes it would incur costs of approximately million to refurbish and retrofit the satellite so that it could be sold to another customer 
there can be no assurance  however  that ss l will be able to find such a replacement customer for the satellite or its chinese launch vehicle 
ss l will record a charge to earnings of approximately million if it is unable to find a replacement customer for this launch vehicle 
in march  jurisdiction for satellite licensing was transferred from the commerce department to the state department and the state department has issued regulations relating to the export of  and disclosure of technical information related to  satellites and related equipment 
ss l anticipates that obtaining licenses and technical assistance agreements under these new regulations will take more time and will be considerably more burdensome than in the past 
delays in obtaining the necessary licenses and technical assistance agreements may delay ss l s performance on existing contracts  and  as a result  ss l may incur penalties or lose incentive payments under these contracts 
in addition  such delays may have an adverse effect on ss l s ability to compete against foreign satellite manufacturers for new satellite contracts
