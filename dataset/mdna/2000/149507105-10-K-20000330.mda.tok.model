the company entered into a credit agreement with its primary lender in february and later amended it in march and june the credit facility presently consists of a million revolving  warehouse and term loan agreement 
the credit facility contains a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit of up to and of the company s eligible as defined accounts receivable and inventories  respectively  up to a maximum of million 
interest is payable under the revolving line of credit at the bank s prime rate  or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
the warehouse and term loan agreements contained in the credit facility provide for borrowings of up to of the company s eligible as defined installment sales contracts  up to a maximum of million 
interest on the term notes is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at a rate based on the weekly average yield on five year treasury securities averaged over the preceding weeks  plus  with a floating rate for the remaining two years subject to certain limits equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
the warehouse component of the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million with interest payable at the bank s prime rate  or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
however  in no event may the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the warehouse and term loan agreement exceed million 
under the credit facility  no amounts were outstanding at december  and december  the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  the company s ability to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed  in the aggregate  million  iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate million and iv make capital expenditures in excess of million 
in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of net working capital at least million  tangible net worth which must increase at least million per year  subject to a carryover for increases in excess of million in the prior year  debt to equity ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio not less than to 
the credit facility also requires cac to comply with certain specified restrictions and financial covenants

since its inception  cac has been restricted in the amounts of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
in february  cac entered into an agreement with another lender providing for the periodic resale of a portion of cac s loans that meet established criteria and without recourse provided that the transferred loan was properly originated by the dealer and purchased by cac 
in march and in june  cac sold  under the retail finance agreement  a substantial portion of its existing portfolio of loans on those dates 
the effect of these transactions on net income was to reduce the amount of financial services revenue from interest income on these portions of the portfolio  offset by reduced interest expense on debt retired in march and earnings on the remaining proceeds 
the company may sell a substantial portion of its remaining installment loan portfolio in fiscal year  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cac in the future 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under the retail finance agreement will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cac to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under this agreement  or that cac and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreement 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
in order to provide additional funds for continued pursuit of the company s business plans and for operations  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank indebtedness or other forms of financing and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
the company may engage in other transactions  such as selling or securitizing all or portions of its installment loan portfolio  that are designed to facilitate the ability of the company to originate an increased volume of loans and to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and has entered into such a transaction pursuant to the retail finance agreement  as further described above 
there can be no assurance that such possible additional financing  or the aforementioned potential transactions involving the company s installment loan portfolio  will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
it is possible that a future lack of financing or a prolonged downturn in industry conditions could cause the company to curtail or otherwise alter its current business plans and operating strategies 
impact of inflation the company generally has been able to increase its selling prices to offset increased costs  including the costs of raw materials 
sudden increases in costs as well as price competition  however  can affect the ability of the company to increase its selling prices 
as discussed above  in  the company experienced tightened supply of certain types of raw materials  which resulted in some higher costs that were not recoverable through price increases 
for a further discussion of this matter  see compared to gross profit 
the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability  but can give no assurance that this trend will continue in the future

cost incurred to complete the assessment and see safe harbor statement on page implementation of year issues was million  which was within the reported estimated range of million and million as an expense  in addition to approximately million of capital expenditures 
no critical problems associated with the year issue have been encountered and minor issues have been corrected as discovered without significant disruption to the company s processes and without implementation of the company s contingency plan 
the company s year program included testing each computer system and microprocessor in use  identifying significant third parties year compliance  converting company systems to year compliant versions of software products and equipment and developing a contingency plan 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company is exposed to market risk related to investments held in a non qualified trust used to fund benefits under its deferred compensation plan 
these investments totaled million at december  due to the long term nature of the benefit liabilities that these assets fund  the company currently considers its exposure to market risk to be low 
the company does not believe that a decline in market value of these investments would result in a material near term funding of the trust or exposure to the benefit liabilities funded 
the company purchases retail installment contracts from its exclusive dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resells certain of these loans to a financial institution under the terms of the retail finance agreement discussed above 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time 
additionally  the company has installment loans receivable in its portfolio of million  which may be sold during the company s portfolio consists of fixed rate contracts with interest rates generally ranging from to and an average original term of months at december  the company estimated the fair value of its installment contracts receivable using discounted cash flows and interest rates offered by cac on similar contracts at december  the company has notes payable under retail floor plan agreements and an industrial development revenue bond issue that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
since these borrowings are floating rate debt  an increase in short term interest rates would adversely affect interest expense 
the company may retire this debt if interest rates were to increase significantly 
additionally  the company has five industrial development revenue bond issues at fixed interest rates 
the estimated fair value of outstanding borrowings approximated carrying value at december  the company estimated the fair value of its debt instruments using rates at which the company believes it could have obtained similar borrowings at that time 
the company also has the ability to incur debt under its credit facility which provides for interest at the bank s prime rate for the revolving and warehouse line of credit and at fixed rates for a certain period of time for the term notes
