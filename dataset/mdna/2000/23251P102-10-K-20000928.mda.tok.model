summary we were founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
clinical trials of the ncp system began with the first patient implant in november under ide from the fda 
we received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory or resistent to antiepileptic drugs 
we were granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the ncp system in the member countries of the european union and we also have permission to sell in certain other international markets with the broader indication of refractory epilepsy and without discrimination to patient age 
from inception through july  our primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the ncp system 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities which includes product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities and manufacturing start up 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the united states market launch of the ncp system and the clinical research costs associated with new indications development 
although we reported a profitable quarter in the third quarter of this fiscal year  we expect to remain unprofitable through at least fiscal as we continue our efforts to develop vagus nerve stimulation for new indications 
for the period from inception through june   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
moreover  we expect to devote considerable financial resources in our depression and other indications business units for clinical studies in the development of new indications for the ncp system 
the clinical studies for depression are for investigational therapies that are not expected to generate significant sales prior to fda approval  which is not anticipated before calendar as a result  we will continue to experience substantial operating losses at levels exceeding the levels experienced in recent periods 
furthermore  the timing and nature of these expenditures are contingent upon several factors outside of our control and may exceed the current expectations of securities analysts and investors 
we do not expect to be profitable before fiscal if at all 
recent developments on september   medtronic  inc medtronic publicly announced a proposal to acquire us for per share in value of medtronic common stock 
our board of directors  with the assistance of morgan stanley dean witter  our financial advisor  elected to remain independent to pursue our patent protected opportunities for vagus nerve stimulation in epilepsy  depression  alzheimer s disease  obesity  and in other indications covered by our united states method patents 
on september   medtronic announced that it had withdrawn its offer 
morgan stanley dean witter was engaged to serve as our financial advisor in connection with this proposal and we are currently obligated to pay them million for advisory services 
we will be obligated to make an additional payment to morgan stanley dean witter of not less than million on or before may  in addition  our board of directors has authorized the development and implementation of a retention plan for officers and key employees 
this plan will provide for cash payments to employees which will range from six months to three years  depending on seniority  plus bonus and will be payable only upon a change of control 
we have also incurred additional legal and accounting fees as a result of medtronic s actions 
results of operations net sales 
net sales increased to million from million and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
international sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  while us sales were million  million and million in the respective periods 
substantially all sales for the years ended june   and were for epilepsy product sales 
we have experienced significant growth in the us market since fda approval 
in fiscal  our first full year after fda approval  us net sales were million 
us net sales more than doubled in fiscal to million due entirely to volume increases 
for fiscal  us net sales continue to show aggressive growth of  as a result of volume growth of and an increase in average system price which generated additional revenue growth of 
in february  we launched the next generation ncp generator  the model  which was lighter  had a longer battery life and was priced at a premium to the existing model as a result of the favorable market reception of the model  sales mix towards the model shifted  resulting in the improved pricing for the year 
since regulatory approval in  international sales have grown at a slower growth rate than the us due to economic and reimbursement limitations and the company s focus on penetrating the us market 
from fiscal to  international sales increased by primarily due to volume growth 
in fiscal  international sales increased by due to volume growth of and an increase in average system price which generated additional revenue growth of  due to the launch of the model in march while we expect to conduct additional clinical trial activities in the united states and internationally and may seek reimbursement in connection with these studies  we do not expect reimbursement amounts to be significant in future periods 
future increases in net sales will depend upon increased market acceptance for the ncp system and upon expanding our reimbursement from third party payors 
we are devoting substantial resources to increasing the awareness and market acceptance of the ncp system  particularly in the united states 
we believe  however  that there will be delays between sales and marketing activities and any resulting increase in sales 
we cannot assure you that sales levels in subsequent periods will increase at the rates experienced in recent periods or at all 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
our gross margin was for the year ended june   compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal is attributable primarily to the increase in net sales in the united states  which have higher gross margins than net sales in international markets and process improvements in manufacturing 
we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate of approximately of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between direct and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the ncp system s selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal and million  or of net sales  during fiscal fiscal expenses increased over fiscal by due to increases in personnel costs associated with the expansion of the sales and marketing team which was offset by reductions in marketing and sales program event costs and reductions in outside services that were brought in house during the year 
fiscal expense increased over fiscal expense primarily due to increases in sales and marketing activities focused on the united states market launch for the ncp system and to a lesser extent to the continued expansion of corporate infrastructure 
at the end of fiscal  we had over sales and marketing personnel  up from at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal although we were able to minimize growth in expenses significantly below sales growth during fiscal  we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve spending efficiencies or that selling  general and administrative expenses will not  in fact  increase at a faster rate in fiscal the significant decrease in these expenses as a percent of sales in each year is primarily the result of the increase in sales for the same periods 
substantially all selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and were associated with the epilepsy business unit 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of both expenses related to our product and process development  and design efforts and expenses associated with conducting clinical trials and related regulatory activities 
research and development expenses were mil lion  or of net sales  during the year ended june   compared to million  or of net sales  during the year ended june  and million  or of net sales  during the year ended june  the significant decrease in these expenses as a percent of sales in each year is primarily the result of the increase in sales for the same periods 
we operate our business in three indication business units  each of which invests significant resources into research and development projects 
the epilepsy business unit research and development expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase of million in fiscal over prior year is due to costs associated with additional personnel  higher clinical study costs and the expansion of our cyberonics vns patient outcome registry 
the decrease in research and development costs from fiscal to fiscal is the result of higher absorption of production costs during fiscal offset by heightened levels of product design and development activity 
the depression business unit research and development expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the significant ramp up of expenses from over the three year period between fiscal and fiscal is a result of expanded clinical programs for the clinical study of the ncp system for the treatment of major depression in patients with unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder 
during fiscal  we launched a pilot safety and efficacy study of vagus nerve stimulation using the ncp system in patients with treatment resistant chronic or recurrent severe depression which continued in fiscal and will continue in fiscal in fiscal  the fda granted approval for expansion of the pilot clinical study  increasing the number of implanted patients from to also in fiscal  the fda granted unconditional approval for a pivotal clinical study of vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of depression to include up to institutions and patients 
we subsequently received unconditional fda approval for a revised final protocol to include up to institutions and implanted patients 
we expect to expend considerable financial resources completing the pilot study and initiating the pivotal study of the ncp system in patients with depression during fiscal and beyond 
the obesity and other new indications business unit research and development expenses were  in fiscal  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease of expenses from fiscal to fiscal and the increase from to is directly related to increases and decreases in total clinical program costs associated with investigational clinical studies of the ncp system for the treatment of various neurological disorders 
in fiscal  the clinical study costs were primarily directed toward epilepsy and depression studies in our other business units 
during fiscal  we launched several animal studies of vns using the ncp system for a variety of disorders 
in fiscal  we focused the majority of our clinical resources toward the study of vns in patients suffering from obesity and ad  while also investigating other neurological disorders covered by our patent portfolio 
in june the fda approved an investigational device exemption ide for a clinical study utilizing a new type of vns to treat obesity 
shortly thereafter  we launched a two phase pilot safety and efficacy study using the ncp system to treat obesity 
in the first phase  six patients will be implanted and treated 
if the results of the phase i study justify continued research  up to additional patients will be treated in phase ii  for a total of up to implanted and treated patients in the pilot study 
in june  the swedish government approved a pilot clinical study of vns for the treatment of ad 
shortly thereafter  we launched a pilot study of up to implanted patients with a study protocol of three months in the acute study and long term follow up 
we expect to expend considerable resources completing the pilot studies for obesity and ad and other indications development research throughout fiscal and beyond 
interest income 
interest income totaled million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal as a result of lower average cash and investment balances on hand 
we expect interest and other income to gradually decline in absolute dollars in future periods as we utilize our resources to fund future working capital requirements 
interest expense 
interest expense was  during the year ended june   with no interest expense reported in prior years 
interest expense for fiscal is associated with capital leases on manufacturing equipment which bear interest at over a term of five years 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
for each of these years  other income expense consisted primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect other income expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon the mix between international and domestic business activities and upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire during the years through  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which expire during the years through due to our net operating loss history  to date we have established a valuation allowance to fully offset our deferred tax assets  including those related to our carryforwards  resulting in no income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
current federal income tax regulations with respect to changes in ownership could limit the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
change in accounting principle 
effective july   we changed our method of computing depreciation on domestic fixed assets from the double declining method to the straight line method 
this change was implemented to better match revenues and expenses taking into account the nature of these assets and our business 
the new depreciation method was applied retroactively to all domestic assets acquired in prior years 
the cumulative prior years effect of the changes was  net of income tax of and is included in income for the fiscal year ended june  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our securities 
in june we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment valued at roughly  and used in the production of the ncp system 
the capital leases bear interest at and extend through april during fiscal  we used approximately million in cash in operating activities 
during the fiscal year  working capital increased significantly in support of the substantial sales growth experienced during fiscal accounts receivable and inventories increased from million and million  respectively  in fiscal to million and million respectively in fiscal during fiscal  we also used approximately million to purchase capital equipment to expand manufacturing capabilities and provide significant improvements in integrated business systems 
we received roughly million  million and million in  and  respectively  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options held by our employees 
during fiscal  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a public offering 
our liquidity will continue to be reduced as amounts are expended to support continued growth in sales and manufacturing  continuing clinical trials and related regulatory affairs  product and process development and infrastructure development 
although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities and to enhance general infrastructure and facilities 
we believe that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through june   although there can be no assurance of this as this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  which may not hold true 
the availability of financing either before or after that time will depend upon a number of important factors  including the state of the united states capital markets and economy in general and the health care and medical device segments in particular  the status of our international and domestic sales activities and the status of our clinical and regulatory activities 
we may not be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms favorable to us 
impact of new accounting pronouncements see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could affect our future results 
we rely on only one product for our revenues and if sales of this product are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
we have only one product  the ncp system  which has been approved by the fda for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we do not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the ncp system in the united states for at least the next two years 
although sales of our ncp system have been increasing  we cannot assure you that sales will continue to increase at the same rate or at all 
we are currently requesting approval for the use of the ncp system for the treatment of major depression in patients with unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder 
we do not yet have approvals necessary to commercialize the ncp system for the treatment of depression 
we cannot assure you that any approvals for the treatment of depression with the ncp system will be granted  nor can we assure you that even if the approval is granted  we will be successful in commercializing the ncp system for the treatment of depression 
the same uncertainty surrounds our efforts in obesity and ad applications 
our inability to commercialize successfully the ncp system for depression  obesity and other indications will severely harm our business 
we may not be able to continue to expand market acceptance of the use of our ncp system to treat epilepsy  which could cause our sales to decrease 
continued market acceptance of our ncp system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the ncp system 
while the ncp system has been used in approximately  patients through june   many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing antiepileptic drugs and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the ncp system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the ncp system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
we cannot assure you that the ncp system will achieve market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication 
failure of the ncp system to gain market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns for the treatment of depression  obesity  alzheimer s disease or any other indications 
we are in the process of conducting studies to help us evaluate  and ultimately obtain fda approval  for the use of vns as a treatment for depression  obesity  alzheimer s disease and other indications 
while we are encouraged by test results to date  we cannot assure you that our test results will continue to be as positive as we currently anticipate or that we will receive fda approval for the use of our product for the treatment of any other indication 
even if we receive fda approval for another indication  we can provide no assurances with respect to market acceptance 
if our test results are not as we anticipate  if we receive no additional fda approvals or if alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenues will not experience the growth that we currently anticipate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the extent to which our ncp system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for our ncp system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payors  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if our expenses were not accompanied by increased sales  our results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter would be harmed 
we may be unable to obtain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the ncp system successfully depends in part on whether third party payors  including private health care insurers  managed care plans  the united states government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the ncp system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the ncp system and the related services we have in the united states or internationally 
if we fail to achieve or expand favorable coverage decisions for the ncp system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the ncp system which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
we cannot assure you that our marketing and sales efforts will succeed in promoting the ncp system to patients  health care providers or third party payors on a broad basis 
in addition  due to limited market awareness of the ncp system  we believe that the sales process could be lengthy  requiring us to continue to educate patients  health care providers and third party payors regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the ncp system 
in certain international territories  we rely  and intend to continue to rely  upon independent distributors 
we may not be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel or foreign distributors to support our marketing and sales efforts 
our failure to successfully market and sell our ncp system or to retain our sales force would severely impair our sales and our business 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the ncp system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the ncp system  when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have significant defects that could harm the human body and result in product recalls 
the ncp system includes a complex electronic device and lead designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition in patients 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring removal and potential reimplantation of the ncp system or a component of the ncp system 
for example  in  a failure of an ncp system caused permanent paralysis of one patient s left vocal cord 
in addition  several patients experienced bipolar lead failures which  although not harmful to the patient  reduced the efficacy of the treatment and required lead replacement 
since the occurrence of these failures  changes have been made to our product designs and no similar failures have been reported 
however in the future  we may experience similar or other product problems or may be required to recall products 
any product recall could severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the ncp system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and we cannot assure you that patents will issue from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology  or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed united states patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
we may have to engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the ncp system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future antiepileptic drugs will continue to be the primary competition for our ncp system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to clinically assess an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the ncp system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the ncp system in the united states  we have begun and intend to continue to significantly expand the scope of our operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend upon the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business would suffer 
we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the ncp system entails the risk of product liability claims 
our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover any of these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the ncp system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the united states by federal agencies  primarily the fda  and by comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the ncp system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the ncp system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the united states 
we have recently begun to focus our marketing and sales activities in international markets 
we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the ncp system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions
