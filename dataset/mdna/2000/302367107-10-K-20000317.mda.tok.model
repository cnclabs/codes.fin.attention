net income excluding special items    diluted earnings per share results of operations net interest income approximately of bancorp s gross revenue was derived from net interest income in  up from in net interest income is principally the sum of interest and fees on loans plus interest and discount on investment securities  less interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
although interest bearing deposits continued to represent bancorp s principal funding source  factors largely related to intense competition for bank deposits throughout the financial services industry have forced banks to seek dependable  relatively low cost alternative sources of funds 
bancorp frequently supplements its funding with federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which have proven to be reliable and cost effective across all maturities selected 
other  more traditional  funding sources include repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
net interest income is influenced by a number of external economic and competitive factors such as the federal reserve board monetary policy and its influence on market interest rates  loan demand and competition from nonbank lenders  and competition with investment managers  brokerage firms and investment bankers for consumer and commercial business assets that might otherwise be deposited in banks 
internal factors impacting levels and changes in net interest income are attributed to bancorp s interest rate risk management policies  which address a variety of issues including loan and deposit pricing practices  funding alternatives and maturity schedules 
historically  bancorp has not made use of derivatives  interest rate hedges or similar instruments or transactions to manage interest rate risk  but is prepared to employ such instruments as circumstances dictate

while the growth in average repurchase balances between and reflected growth in underlying commercial account relationships  a increase in fhlb borrowings was related chiefly to funding the vault cash build up recommended by regulatory guidance to meet potential customer needs related to the year the net interest margin margin  which is the ratio of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets  has been under considerable pressure throughout the banking industry  especially over the past two years 
a moderate decline in the margin to for compared with for was principally the result of modest growth in total average loans  with stronger growth in lower yielding investment securities 
furthermore  bancorp s earning assets have a tendency to re price more quickly than its interest bearing liabilities  further exacerbating the margin decline as interest rates moved lower in the beginning of the last quarter of the year reflected a reversal of this trend as interest rates increased slightly 
table  analysis of changes in net interest income  quantifies the change in net interest income for the periods presented and  as discussed above  shows how much was attributed to volume factors and how much was influenced by interest rate movements 
bancorp endeavors to maintain a relatively balanced position between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities without forgoing opportunities to benefit from relevant interest rate conditions within the boundaries of prudent risk management and established corporate policy

income taxes income tax expense decreased by to million for  from million for  largely related to a decrease in income before taxes 
tax expense varies with changes in the level of income before taxes  the amount of tax exempt income realized  and the relationship of these changes to each other 
also  the amount of income tax expense differs from the amount computed at statutory rates primarily because interest realized on state and municipal obligations and certain loans is tax exempt 
see note  income taxes  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate  which is the provision for income taxes divided by income before taxes  increased slightly to for compared with for largely related to non tax deductible expenses associated with the acquisitions 
financial condition sources and uses of funds bancorp s financial condition can be evaluated by analyzing its sources and uses of funds 
the comparison of average balances in table shows an increase in average earning assets uses for of million  or above  and indicates how that increase was funded sources 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is structured and managed to meet several important financial objectives to maintain sufficient balance sheet liquidity to meet any reasonable decline in deposits and any anticipated increase in loans 
to insure safety of principal and interest by investing only in securities permitted by regulation 
to maximize income consistent with liquidity and safety requirements 
to maintain a source of assets which can be pledged as collateral for federal  state and municipal deposits 
the investment securities portfolio is held in two categories for accounting and reporting purposes available for sale afs securities are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily to maturity  and held to maturity htm securities are those for which there is both a positive intent and an ability to hold to maturity 
these determinations are made when the securities are purchased and are integral to bancorp s asset liability alm policies 
the accounting policy for investment securities is set forth in note  nature of banking activities and significant accounting policies  notes to consolidated financial statements 
short term uses of funds  shown in table as federal funds and interest bearing deposits with banks  are principally a function of the management of bancorp s daily cash and liquidity requirements 
an increase in these accounts  for example  may indicate a temporary excess of investable funds not otherwise required for increases in loans or investments  or decreases in deposits 
conversely  a decrease in these categories usually indicates the opposite

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
no interest is taken into income on nonaccrual loans unless received in cash or until such time as the borrower demonstrates sustained performance over a period of time in accordance with contractual terms 
other real estate owned includes banking premises no longer used for business purposes  real estate acquired by foreclosure in partial or complete satisfaction of debt or otherwise surrendered by the borrower to bancorp s possession 
other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of acquisition or transfer from loans 
write downs to fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
subsequent to transfer  these assets are adjusted through a valuation allowance to the lower of the net carrying value or the fair value net of estimated selling expenses based on periodic appraisals 
nonaccrual loans are not included 
potential problem loans at december   there were million in loans that management had reasonable concerns might become contractually past due or be classified as a nonperforming asset 
these loans are subject to the same close attention and regular credit reviews as extended to loans past due days or more and nonperforming assets 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level  which in management s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management 
additions to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
on a quarterly basis  a comprehensive review of the allowance is performed considering such factors as the levels of loans outstanding  loss experience  delinquency levels  certain individual loan reviews  and an evaluation of the regional and national economic environment 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of three primary elements the formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying historically determined loss factors to outstanding business loans based on credit risk ratings and for pools of homogeneous loans 
individually risk rated loan loss factors are determined using average annual net charge off rates for the most recent two years 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans 
pooled loan loss factors are based on net charge offs experienced over the past year 
the historic loss factors on the risk rated loans and the pooled loans are then considered for either positive or negative adjustment in an attempt to reflect the current dynamics of the portfolios 
these adjustments in the loss factors are tied to management s evaluation of a number of factors including changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  classified and non accrual assets  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in lending policies  underwriting standards  or collection practices  changes in the experience  ability  depth of lending management and staff  portfolio concentrations  and changes in the national or local economy 
specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of non performing loans 
the analysis considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral or other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to repay 
the unallocated allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  internal audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
as reflected in table  at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of total non accrual loans 
this compares to an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  equivalent to of total loans and of non accrual loans 
net charge offs during were thousand less than table  analysis of allowance for credit losses  shows a five year history of activity reflecting relative stability in both the annual charge off ratio and the level of the allowance related to total loans 
bancorp had loans amounting to approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  that were specifically classified as impaired and included in non accrual loans in table at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  consisting of million representing the formula allowance  a thousand specific allowance  and a million unallocated allowance 
table  allocation of allowance for credit losses  discloses management s allocation of the allowance to various loan categories 
this reflects the underlying trends in loan growth and the change in mix 
as they are estimates  this allocation is not intended to limit the amount of the allowance available to absorb losses from any type of loan and should not be viewed as an indicator of the specific amount or specific loan category in which future charge offs may ultimately occur 
during management reduced the size of the provision for loan losses due to the following factors improvements in net charge offs in the indirect installment loan portfolio 
continued net recoveries in the commercial portfolios 
reserve adequacy as measured against the various ratios tracked regularly and by comparison to peer banks 
see note  loans  notes to consolidated financial statements  for disclosures pertaining to impaired loans and the specific allowance related thereto 
while management believes the allowance for credit losses was adequate at december   the estimate of losses and related allowance may change in the near term due to economic and other uncertainties inherent in the estimation process

year computer readiness this disclosure is provided pursuant to the securities and exchange commission s interpretation entitled disclosure of year issues and consequences by public companies  investment advisors  investment companies and municipal securities issuers effective august  the year issue arose because many existing date sensitive computer programs  hardware  software  and other devices relying on imbedded chip technology do not recognize a year that begins with because traditional programming has been limited to utilization of a two digit code for a year such as for the year 
bancorp has undertaken to review its operating and information technology systems and other mechanical equipment such as elevators to identify systems in which the year issue exists and to undertake the necessary renovation or replacement of these systems so that the companies will continue to operate as usual after january  in july  bancorp established a year issue task team comprised of representatives across functional lines representing all of its subsidiaries 
the year issue task team developed a year issue assurance plan to coordinate and direct its efforts 
the plan was approved by the board of directors on september  the task team provides quarterly reports to the board outlining the status of its efforts and its anticipated work in the coming quarter 
the assurance plan is composed of five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and  implementation  which mirror guidelines developed by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec to deal with the year issue 
the assurance plan includes a timeline for completion of all tasks identified 
as of december   all critical tasks are current according to the timeline 
activities under each of the phases are ongoing as new vendor and customer relationships are created 
the task team has received guidance from various regulators including the occ  securities and exchange commission sec  ots  and ffiec 
the task team established a program to educate all associates regarding the year issue both for internal systems and as the issue may affect customers 
education of customers is continuing through periodic information in the form of brochures  seminars  a toll free information line  a web page  and participation in community forums 
both activities are consistent with the year customer communication outline issued by the ffiec on february  all vendors who supply hardware  software and or services of any type which may be affected by this issue have been identified and contacted 
a total of four hundred eighty eight products and services are represented by this vendor listing and have been categorized as either mission critical those that directly impact daily operations  concern those that can be replaced with manual processes  or low priority little or no impact on daily operations 
vendors have been surveyed as to their year issue readiness 
the task team has confirmed vendor responses by testing products and services where possible to verify their readiness 
of the one hundred twenty four products and services identified as mission critical forty two are not date sensitive and are deemed year issue ready 
nineteen cannot be tested internally 
the progress of these service providers efforts addressing the year issue are being closely monitored 
all nineteen advise that their products and or services are either year issue ready now or will be in advance of january  examples of products and or services that are not capable of internal testing include utilities and communications services 
sixty three have been successfully tested 
bancorp relies on kirchman corporation s dimension software for maintaining customer accounting records 
kirchman is a provider of accounting systems for more than  banking clients worldwide 
kirchman s internal methodologies addressing year issues have been reviewed and have received itaa certification by the information technology association of america  an independent non profit organization 
further  kirchman systems have passed all internal tests  and testing is complete 
the task team has developed procedures for assessing year issue risk for its funds providers  including depositors  which are intended to manage and limit potential risks associated with large or significant concentrations of retail and commercial deposits 
the year issue readiness of providers of lines of credit have been reviewed 
the task team has also established procedures  utilizing the standard risk classifications employed to manage credit risk  for reviewing the year issue readiness of borrowers 
loan relationships with balances exceeding  or which are particularly computer reliant  have been reviewed 
no relationships are adversely risk rated because of year issue risk 
bancorp s existing contingency plan has been enhanced to provide responses for year issues 
the contingency planning committee adopted the five phase model as recommended by the ffiec and occ advisory letter and had an updated plan by december   as required by the regulators 
testing of business resumption plans was substantially complete at march  bancorp believes its efforts  and those of its third party providers  will effectively address year issues before january  because bancorp is so reliant on third party providers whose products and services cannot be effectively tested such as utilities and telecommunications services for support  bancorp s normal business operations could be disrupted in the event one or more third party providers fail to provide products and services as contracted 
the most reasonably likely worst case year issue scenario identified to date involves bancorp s inability  for short periods  to provide services to customers 
the worst case scenario is mitigated somewhat by an ability to manually process customer transactions  by the geographic penetration of our branch network  and by alternative service delivery methods  which include both proprietary and network atms  pc banking  telephone banking  and express bank  bancorp s full service mobile branch 
power and telecommunication services are critical  but might be interrupted for only a part of the branch network 
bancorp has a generator to provide power to operate computer systems and  by contract  has geographically remote facilities served by alternative sources of power to process work  if needed 
longer periods of disruption could affect bancorp s ability to develop new business and could increase costs of operation and decrease revenues 
bancorp has generators placed strategically in its branch network to allow for continued operations in the event of power interruptions 
the generators will enhance bancorp s ability to conduct business as usual in any natural disaster  in addition to any year issue related power outage 
update post december  bancorp experienced no significant problem during the december january nd weekend 
business continued as usual over the weekend and commencing january  all systems were successfully tested by noon on january st 
no systems interruptions related to year issues have been experienced through february  third party service providers whose systems could not be tested prior to january  also have continued to provide essentially uninterrupted service 
noted problems were minor and were handled through bancorp s contingency planning process 
no loan relationships in excess of  have been identified which have experienced payment or credit risk concerns as a result of year issues 
bancorp plans to continue to monitor systems at february and  for year issue related problems 
bancorp s contingency plans are designed to address any such problems 
the most reasonably likely year issue worst case scenario continues to be as identified above 
as of february   bancorp has spent a total of  addressing year issues from a total budget of  bancorp does not anticipate any significant additional expenses 
work is done predominantly by existing associates as part of their normal work responsibilities 
bancorp does not separately track these internal costs which are principally payroll related 
costs for dealing with year issues are being provided from operating revenues 
asset and liability management the primary objectives for bancorp s asset liability management policies are to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
bancorp s asset liability policies are approved by the board of directors and administered by bancorp s asset liability management committee alco  which is primarily composed of executive officers 
alco s principal responsibilities include monitoring corporate financial performance 
determining liquidity requirements 
establishing interest rates  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products 
assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment 
reviewing and ratifying investment portfolio transactions under established policy guidelines 
monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to meet the demand for funds from both depositors and borrowers with either balance sheet assets or access to incremental borrowings 
these needs are met with cash on hand  the sale of non cash assets  or with funds received from depositors or lenders 
the primary focus of liquidity management is to match the cash inflows and outflows within bancorp s natural market for loans and deposits 
the primary cash and liquidity management tools are short term investments  fhlb borrowings and repurchase agreements 
secondary liquidity is provided by the investment securities portfolio 
asset liquidity includes monitoring the amount of available cash on hand and assets maturing in the near term  limiting the amount of securities that may be pledged  and maintaining relatively short duration of investment securities 
tables and show a combined total of million of investment securities and certain loans coming due within months  or of total assets at december  funding liquidity is monitored primarily by the ratio of loans to deposits 
as loan growth resumed in  the loan to deposit ratio increased sharply to at december  from one year earlier 
funding liquidity is also augmented by a wide variety of borrowing sources including the fhlb and credit lines available through correspondent banking relationships 
market risk market risk is defined as the future changes in market prices that increase or decrease the value of financial instruments  ie  cash  investments  loans  deposits and debt 
included in market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk  and other relevant market risks 
the primary source of market risk is interest rate risk 
market risk sensitive financial instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the effect of changes in market rates depends on the extent and timing of such changes and on bancorp s ability to adjust 
the ability to adjust is controlled by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on earnings and capital 
re pricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  bancorp considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook for interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  traditional cumulative gap and simulation analyses are used to determine the impact on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity mve 
bancorp attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity on the basis of when assets and liabilities will reprice as opposed to when they can reprice 
cumulative gap analysis presents the net amount of assets and liabilities that will most likely reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
using that analysis  the effect of changes in market interest rates  both rising and falling  on net interest income can be calculated 
because of inherent limitations in traditional cumulative gap analysis  however  alco also employs more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current re pricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of   and basis points  and to determine how net interest income varies under alternative interest rate and business activity scenarios 
alco also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on the mve  ie  the net present value of all future cash flows from financial instruments expressed as the percentage change in portfolio value of equity for any given change in prevailing interest rates 
table presents mve at december  table effects of changes in interest rates on mve at december  dollars in thousands percent change market value hypothetical hypothetical change in of portfolio change increase board interest rates equity increase decrease decrease limit bp rise   bp rise   bp rise   base scenario  bp decline   bp decline   bp decline   established by bancorp s board of directors computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and changes in deposit levels 
they are not intended to be a forecast and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management could take in response to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the changes in net interest income and or mve calculated under these alternative methods were within limits established by the board of directors and monitored by alco 
capital resources it is bancorp s policy to maintain a level of capital sufficient to protect the company s depositors  creditors  and shareholders  and to support bancorp s growth 
the principal source of capital is retained earnings 
the board  the occ and the ots maintain capital adequacy guidelines applicable to bancorp  the bank  and the savings bank  respectively  as disclosed in note  shareholders equity  notes to consolidated financial statements 
under each measure  bancorp and its subsidiaries were substantially in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and  by definition  were well capitalized at december  and in accordance with regulatory guidelines  fair value adjustments to shareholders equity for changes in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale are excluded from the calculations 
effects of changing prices inasmuch as virtually all of a financial institution s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates  or the price paid for money  may have a significant effect on earnings performance 
interest rates  though affected by inflation  do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
movements in interest rates are a result of the perceived changes in the rate of inflation and the effects of monetary and fiscal policies 
reference to net interest income and market risk in this section will assist the reader s understanding of how bancorp is positioned to address changing interest rates 
several major categories of noninterest expense are more directly affected by inflationary factors such as salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
management endeavors to overcome  or mitigate  the effects of inflation by seeking opportunities to improve operating efficiency and productivity  and by developing strategies for growth that will exceed the projected rate of inflation 
compared to overview net income for decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for  largely reflecting the influence of special items in both years as set forth in table excluding special items in both years  net operating income increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per share for special items special items for  as shown in table on an after tax basis  included million of merger related expense  or per share 
this amount included thousand per share of merger related expenses pertaining to the integration of core processing systems and administrative functions at the savings bank  acquired in november  thousand per share related to the may acquisition of ks  and million per share related to the acquisition and integration of tbt 
a special provision for possible loan losses related to the acquisition of tbt amounted to thousand after tax  or per share 
the integration of tbt s core processing systems and administrative functions was completed in february net securities gains realized by tbt during amounted to thousand per share  and bancorp realized a net gain of thousand per share on the sale of bank owned real estate 
special items special items for  as shown in table on an after tax basis  included a thousand gain on the sale of the credit card merchant processing business per share 
recognizing the difficulty in achieving sufficient economies of scale over the near term  bancorp elected to exit this highly competitive line of business in favor of alternatives expected to produce greater profitability over the long term 
tbt incurred litigation costs of thousand per share and realized a thousand gain on the sale of loans in per share and a thousand gain on the sale of investment securities pursuant to the provisions of the plan and agreement to merge with home federal  compensatory payments were recognized in for two executive officers who elected to resign during the year 
such compensation expense totaled thousand per share and was to be paid over a month period 
net interest income net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to million for  from million for the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points 
although there was an increased reliance on borrowed funds in  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined one basis point assisted by lower average rates paid on core deposit products

noninterest income for included a thousand gain on the sale of loans and thousand in gains on sales of investment securities by tbt 
bancorp realized a thousand gain on the sale of the credit card merchant processing business discussed earlier 
if the operating income recognized in from this line of business was also eliminated  comparable noninterest income before special items increased in trust income declined in excluding approximately thousand represented by an unusually large estate administration fee realized in  the underlying rate of increase in trust income was for trust assets under management  having declined significantly related to the late summer stock market correction  rebounded to close at million  above million in assets under management at year end service charges on deposit accounts increased in  to million  from million for related largely to transaction volume

other operating income declined to million for from million for principally related to the mid year sale of the credit card merchant processing business and the termination of revenue therefrom 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense  sometimes referred to as overhead expense  increased to million for from million for excluding merger related expense and other special items of an unusual or nonrecurring nature as disclosed in table and discussed below  noninterest expense increased reflecting stringent cost controls and significant efficiencies realized through the integration of the savings bank s core processing systems and administrative functions 
salaries increased to million for from million for excluding thousand in compensation expense recognized pursuant to the provisions of an agreement with the savings bank  salaries increased attributed to merit increases  new hires  promotions  and performance based incentive payments

the increase was principally reflected in loans  which were funded by a variety of sources  the largest component being long term borrowings  closely followed by certificates of deposit and interest bearing checking products 
the capital position was strengthened as the increase in average shareholders equity  over  outpaced the growth in average assets leading to an increase in the average equity capital to assets ratio to for  from for all capital ratios were substantially in excess of regulatory minimums for bancorp and its subsidiaries at each of the years ended december  and provision and allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses was increased by  to million for  from million for the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding decreased slightly to for  from for nonperforming assets continuing a trend extending over the previous four years  nonperforming assets declined further in  by to million at december   from million at year end the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets declined to at december  from
