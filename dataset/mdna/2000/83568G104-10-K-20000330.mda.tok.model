item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company  sonosite  inc  commenced operations in as a project of atl ultrasound  inc we were chartered to develop the design and specifications for a highly portable ultrasound device and other highly portable ultrasound products for potential use for diagnostic imaging in a multitude of clinical and field settings 
from the time we started on this project until we became an independent company  we were organized as a separate division within atl ultrasound 
on february   the atl board of directors approved a plan to spin off our division as an independent  publicly owned company 
this transaction was completed through the tax free distribution of one new share in sonosite  inc for every three shares of atl ultrasound stock held on april  atl ultrasound retained no ownership in our company following the spin off 
we finalized the development and commercialization of our first products in  recognizing our initial product sales in september at december   our products comprised a highly portable ultrasound machine  the sonosite tm  and two transducers 
since we started operations  we have incurred losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses until our product sales generate sufficient revenue to fund our continuing operations 
we may not generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues product sales initial shipments of our products commenced in the third quarter of product sales in totaled million 
there were no product sales in any prior periods 
product sales revenues are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
at the end of the year  our products included the sonosite tm in language configurations  a curved array transducer for abdominal imaging and an intra cavital transducer for transvaginal imaging 
in  we have expanded our product offering to include the sonoheart tm  an ultrasound machine and transducer designed for cardiac imaging 
we also expect to release additional transducers for other clinical applications 
we anticipate that product sales in will increase as compared to grant revenues grant revenue was recognized per the terms of our contract with the defense department and has been generally tied to achieving technological milestones 
grant revenues in were  as compared to  in and million in these varying levels of grant revenues were anticipated 
as of the end of march  we completed the project work and achieved the technical milestones under the contract 
as a result  we received all of the payments agreed to in the contract 
there will be no future grant revenues under existing or past contracts or agreements 
our future revenues will therefore depend on product sales 
gross margin the gross margin on product sales was for we had no product sales and therefore no reported gross margin in any prior period 
we anticipate that the gross margin on our product sales will improve in due primarily to increasing sales of transducers which we expect will become available during the year  the higher realized price of sales achieved by our direct sales consultants and reductions in product costs 
research and development expense research and development expense for was million as compared to million for and million for the to increase in expense was the result of 
a planned increase in basic research and development activities on our current and future products  which was partially offset by a decrease in engineering services procured from atl ultrasound  and 
a significant increase in manufacturing development and production start up expenses associated with design finalization  verification and validation of our first generation of products 
the increase in research and development expense from to was due primarily to additional personnel and personnel related expenses and product development expenses  including increases in engineering services payments to atl ultrasound 
we anticipate that spending levels in research and development will increase in as compared to but at a lower rate than the increase in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses for were million  up significantly from million in and million in the rapid rise in expenses in sales and marketing in as compared to was anticipated due to an increase in personnel as well as activities associated with the worldwide introduction and promotion of our first products 
specific expenses included professional service fees  print media  customer training  customer travel  trade show fees and expenses and travel expenses for our staff 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to is a result of increases in sales and marketing personnel and increases in consulting and travel expenditures 
in  we are hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and we are incurring increased professional service fees in support of our direct selling efforts in the united states 
we plan to continue to utilize significant outside promotional and communications agency resources in support of our current products as well as new product introductions periodically throughout we expect that selling and marketing expenses will again increase significantly in as a result of the planned increase in domestic sales activities 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses in were million  as compared to million in and  in the increase in as compared to was the result of a full year of a higher level of expenses and continued growth in general management  administration  finance  accounting  information service and human resource departments 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was a result of an increase in personnel when we became a stand alone public company in april we expect to add administrative personnel and infrastructure in and we plan to move to a larger facility in the middle of the year 
consequently  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in net loss the net loss for was million  increasing from million in and million in these increases were expected and are due primarily to the increases in operating expenses and decreases in grant revenues as noted above 
these factors were partially offset in by an increase in interest income from invested proceeds of equity financings and million in gross margins as a result of the commencement of product shipments 
we expect to continue to incur quarterly net losses in the near term 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have been funded by million raised through sales of common stock together with the million from atl ultrasound received in connection with our spin off and development grants of million from the department of defense through an award via the advanced research projects agency 
on april   the day we became an independent public company  our former parent  atl ultrasound  contributed to our capital all cumulative expenditures made by them on our business while we were an operating division within atl ultrasound  net of funds received from the us navy 
this book capital contribution totaled million 
in addition  atl ultrasound contributed million in cash in two payments  million in april of and million in january of during  we raised additional cash through two equity offerings 
in april  we raised net proceeds of million through the public issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in november  we raised additional net proceeds of million through the private placement of  shares of our common stock 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
this excludes million of short term investment securities and also excludes million of investment securities with terms longer than one year 
while recent quarterly losses have been reduced as described in results of operations  our cash requirements have increased due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
we expect cash requirements in to be significantly less than in due to anticipated increases in quarterly revenues that will generate lower losses and increasing collections on trade receivables 
we believe the existing cash and cash equivalents and capital which are available through lease financing and other sources of debt financing should be sufficient to fund our operations through as a result  we are not expecting to seek additional equity capital in however  it is difficult to accurately predict the amount of cash that we may require during the upcoming year  which will depend in part upon factors beyond our control  such as lower than anticipated adoption rates or revenues on the existing and new products  technical obstacles  cost overruns in research and development programs or manufacturing activities and greater than anticipated administrative expenses 
if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that adequate financing will be available on a timely basis  on favorable terms  or at all 
year information systems review and status we did not detect or experience any material failures as a result of the date change from to we completed all of our planned readiness reviews by mid october we also monitored the status of our internal systems throughout the month of december and around the clock on the december  and january  no problems were observed with our internal systems nor have any occurred up to the time of this filing 
further  there have been no reported failures with date recognition or calculations with any of our products in the field nor do we have any knowledge of problems with any of our vendors or customers 
we continue to monitor the situation 
we do not anticipate any problems with the year or related potential computer date driven problems 
new accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after june   requires that all derivatives be recognized at their fair value and that corresponding gains or losses be recognized in the operating statements or as a component of comprehensive income depending on the specifics of the derivative instrument 
we have no derivative instruments and expect that adoption of fas will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which we must apply in we do not believe that sab will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk  as a result of changes in interest rates  relates primarily to debt securities held in our investment portfolio 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and debt securities of million  of which million mature within one year and the remainder within two years 
although we hold both fixed and floating rate securities and each carry a certain degree of interest rate risk  we do not consider this risk to be material to our financial statements given their relatively short terms
