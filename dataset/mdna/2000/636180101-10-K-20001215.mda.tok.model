item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
back to table of contents results of operations compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million was the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production  utility  timber and international segments 
these were offset in part by lower earnings in the pipeline and storage segment  the energy marketing segment which had a loss for the year and in corporate operations 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
earnings for included a million after tax non cash impairment of the exploration and production segment s oil and gas assets and the non cash cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
the accounting change  which was a change in depletion methods for the exploration and production segment s oil and gas assets  had a negative million after tax  or per common share  non cash cumulative effect through  which was recorded in the first quarter of excluding these two non cash special items  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million exclusive of the two non cash special items in was the result of higher earnings in the utility  timber  energy marketing and international segments and in corporate operations 
these higher earnings were offset in part by reduced earnings in the exploration and production segment 
the pipeline and storage segment s earnings remained level with the prior year 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows

utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential    commercial    industrial    off system sales    transportation    other    utility throughput mmcf year ended september retail sales residential    commercial    industrial    off system sales    transportation    compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail  off system  and transportation gas sales revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in other operating revenues of million 
the increase in retail gas revenues for the utility segment was primarily due to the recovery of higher gas costs  offset by a decrease in the volumes sold 
the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of the migration of residential and small commercial customers to transportation service in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  offset slightly by the impact of colder weather 
the migration from gas sales to transportation is the result of customers turning to marketers for their gas supplies while using the utility for their gas transportation service 
restructuring in the utility segment s service territory is further discussed in the rate matters section that follows 
transportation revenues increased and volumes were up billion cubic feet bcf as a result of the migration noted above as well as the slightly colder weather 
off system sales revenues increased largely due to increased gas prices and slightly higher volumes 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal 
the decrease in other operating revenues of million was due primarily to a million reduction in refund pool revenue  as discussed below  and an million reduction in revenue for various adjustments including a provision for refund related to the september  conclusion of the two year rate settlement approved by the state of new york public service commission nypsc 
partly offsetting these decreases were two items that reduced revenue in that did not recur in the more significant item was the gas restructuring reserve which reduced revenues by million in this special reserve put aside dollars to be applied against incremental costs that could result from the nypsc s gas restructuring efforts and was required in by the terms of the rate settlement with the nypsc 
the nypsc s gas restructuring efforts are further discussed in the rate matters section that follows 
the second item that reduced revenues was a million adjustment related to the final settlement of internal revenue service irs audits 
also offsetting the decreases noted above  revenue includes million accrued to offset additional state income taxes that resulted from the enactment of tax changes in new york state 
the revenue and related regulatory asset were recorded as the new york department of public service has provided the opportunity of rate recovery by new york state utilities of such additional taxes 
all of these items are included in the other category of the utility operating revenue table above 
as part of its two year rate settlement approved by the nypsc  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the refund pool to offset certain specific expense items 
when dollars from the refund pool are utilized  revenue is recorded and an equal amount of operation and maintenance o m expense is also recorded thus there is no earnings impact 
the amount of refund pool revenue  and related o m expense  recognized in was million less than in compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted from a reduction in retail and off system gas sales revenue of million and million  respectively  and a reduction in other operating revenue of million 
these decreases were partly offset by an increase in transportation revenue of million 
the recovery of lower gas costs and the general base rate decrease in the new york jurisdiction effective october   caused the decrease in retail gas revenue 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from both lower retail volumes sold of bcf and a lower average cost of purchased gas see discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
despite weather that was colder than  retail volumes sold decreased  mainly due to the migration of residential and small commercial retail customers to transportation service 
transportation revenue increased and volumes are up bcf as a result of the migration and because of colder weather 
off system revenue is down due to lower volumes sold of bcf 
the decrease in other operating revenue of million is due primarily to a million gas restructuring reserve  as discussed above  reducing revenue in  million of revenue recorded in as a result of irs audits and million of a revenue reduction in due to a final irs audit settlement 
these items were offset in part by a million lower refund provision recorded in as compared with the refund provision 
the revenue related to the irs audits represents the rate recovery of interest expense as allowed by the new york rate settlement of the refund provision represents the sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount in accordance with the new york rate settlements of and all of these items are included in the other category of the utility operating revenue table above 
earnings compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the prior year 
the increase in earnings resulted primarily from two items in the prior year expenses related to an early retirement offer of million after tax and a special reserve for gas restructuring of million after tax which did not recur in the current year 
these items were offset by higher stock appreciation rights sars expense of million after tax  as discussed below  and revenue adjustments of million after tax  as discussed in the revenue section above 
the increase in the market price of the company s common stock  while benefiting shareholders  carried with it the required recognition of expense for sars 
this expense is spread across all segments  with the greatest impact on pipeline and storage  utility and exploration and production segments 
for  total expense related to sars for all segments was million after tax  and reflects the stock price increase from september  per common share to september  per common share 
the impact of weather on distribution corporation s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc in new york  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits distribution corporation s new york customers 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may since the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  since weather was only colder than  no significant earnings variances occurred 
compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the prior year 
this was largely because the settlement of the primary issues of irs audits of years had a negative impact on earnings in in addition  adjustments made relating to the final settlement of these audits had a positive impact to earnings in absent the irs audit items  earnings of the utility segment were up million from the prior year 
lower o m and interest expenses  a lower refund provision in as noted in the revenue discussion above  positive adjustments for lost and unaccounted for gas related to and and slightly colder weather which mainly benefits the pennsylvania jurisdiction  were the positive contributors to earnings in these items offset the costs associated with the early retirement offers  as well as the effects of a rate settlement that included a million rate reduction in new york that became effective october  and the previously discussed special gas restructuring reserve 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may in the pennsylvania service territory  weather that was colder than increased earnings by approximately million after tax 
degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior yea r buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is currently the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs can be attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation can satisfy a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the per mcf in pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation    interruptible transportation  firm storage service    interruptible storage service other    pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation    interruptible transportation    compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase resulted primarily from higher firm transportation revenue of million  higher interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenues of million  offset by lower firm storage service revenue of million 
the increase in firm transportation revenues resulted primarily from a million pass through type item which did not recur in that reduced revenues in the prior year and correspondingly reduced o m expense in the prior year  thus having no earnings impact 
the increase in interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenues is principally the result of higher throughput volumes 
the decrease in firm storage service revenue was the result of discounted storage service rates  as well as the loss of certain storage service customers 
however  for the winter heating season  all firm storage capacity has been subscribed 
transportation volumes in this segment increased bcf 
generally  volume fluctuations do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable sfv rate design 
however  as mentioned above  the higher interruptible volumes did add to revenues in compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease resulted primarily from lower firm transportation revenue of million  lower interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenue of million  offset in part by higher firm storage service revenue of million 
approximately million of the decrease in the firm transportation revenue related to a pass through type item mentioned above that correspondingly reduced o m expense  thus having no bottom line earnings impact 
interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenue decreased and interruptible volumes transported decreased bcf as a result of full storages at the beginning of the heating season and a warmer than normal winter in  thus supply corporation lacked available storage space to service interruptible customers 
lower interruptible storage service generally results in lower interruptible transportation 
transportation volumes in this segment decreased bcf 
generally  volume fluctuations do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s sfv rate design 
however  as mentioned above  lower interruptible transportation volumes did negatively impact revenue for earnings compared with earnings in the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in compared with in the current year increased sars expense of million after tax and the addition of million of new york state income tax  resulting from recently enacted tax law changes in new york state  contributed to the decrease in earnings 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which regulates this segment  has not provided for the recovery of additional taxes as has the new york department of public service 
several items in the prior year  which did not recur in the current year  also contributed to earnings being less than earnings 
the prior year s earnings included interest income of million after tax and a reduction in income tax of million related to the final settlement of irs audits of years in addition  included the recovery of million after tax of costs related to a gathering project that had been previously reserved for and the recovery  through insurance  of million after tax of a previously expensed base gas loss 
these items were offset in part by a charge in for an early retirement of million after tax 
compared with earnings in the pipeline and storage segment remained at million for and lower revenues  as discussed above  and nonrecurring income in from a buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a customer in the amount of million after tax  were offset by lower o m and interest expenses in items causing lower o m expense in when compared to include the establishment of reserves in for preliminary survey and investigation costs associated with a proposed incremental expansion project and a natural gas gathering project mainly due to lack of interest in furthering these projects 
in addition  supply corporation recognized a base gas loss at its zoar storage field in in total  these three items amounted to million of after tax expense in in  supply corporation reversed million after tax of the gathering project reserve  and recovered  through insurance  million after tax related to the zoar base gas loss 
several significant items also increased o m expense in when compared to  including million of after tax charges for early retirement offers in and the reversal of a portion of a reserve set up in a prior period for a storage project 
supply corporation was able to recover approximately million after tax by selling preliminary engineering  survey  environmental and archeological information from this storage project to the independence pipeline company 
exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging    oil after hedging    gas processing plant    other   production volumes year ended september gas production million cubic feet gulf coast    west coast    appalachia    canada oil production thousands of barrels gulf coast    west coast    appalachia canada average prices year ended september average gas price mcf gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging average oil price bbl gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging refer to further discussion of hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
includes low gravity oil which generally sells for a lower price 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with oil production revenues  net of hedging activities  increased million as the weighted average price of oil after hedging increased and production increased  from the prior year 
oil production from canadian wells acquired as part of the june acquisition of tri link resources  ltd 
tri link now known as national fuel exploration corp 
nfe  added million to oil revenues 
gas production revenues  net of hedging activities  increased million as production increased and the weighted average price of gas after hedging increased 
revenue from seneca s gas processing plant was up million 
these items were partly offset by a million decrease in other revenues resulting primarily from mark to market and other revenue adjustments related to written options 
refer to further discussion of these and other derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with oil production revenues  net of hedging activities  increased million as production increased mainly the result of west coast production from the properties acquired in 
gas production revenue  net of hedging activities  increased million due to higher production also mainly the result of west coast production from the properties acquired in 
revenue from seneca s gas processing plant was up million 
these items were partly offset by a negative mark to market revenue adjustment of million related to written options 
earnings compared with in the exploration and production segment  earnings of million were up million when compared with nfe added million to earnings 
as discussed above  significant improvement in oil and gas pricing  combined with an increase in production  were the main reasons for higher earnings 
partly offsetting higher revenues was an increase in production related expenses  including higher depletion  an increase in lease operating costs  and higher production taxes 
in addition  general and administrative expenses were up as a result of higher costs associated with labor and benefits including sars expense  and interest expense increased due to higher borrowings related to the acquisition of tri link 
the increase in the gas processing plant revenue of million was offset by an equal amount of related expense increase 
compared with in the exploration and production segment  earnings of million were down million exclusive of the two non cash special items in when compared with this is largely because the settlement of the primary issues of irs audits of years had a positive impact on earnings in absent the irs audit items  earnings of the exploration and production segment were down million from depressed oil and gas prices for much of were the main reason for these lower earnings 
higher oil and gas production revenue  as noted in the revenue section above  was offset by increases in lease operating  depletion and interest expense related mainly to seneca s acquisition activity in the increase in the gas processing plant revenue of million was largely offset by an increase in related expenses of million 
international revenues international operating revenues year ended september thousands heating    electricity    other   international heating and electric volumes year ended september heating sales gigajoules    electricity sales megawatt hours    gigajoules one billion joules 
a joule is a unit of energy 
compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease in revenues is largely due to the decrease in value of the czech koruna czk as compared to the us dollar 
while higher heating and electricity sales contributed to higher operating revenues in czk  the decrease in value of the czk caused an overall decrease in revenues when translated into us dollars 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase in revenues as well as the increase in heat and electric volumes  as shown in the tables above  reflects the fact that was the first year in which a full twelve months of sales and revenues are included for pszt now part of the combined company known as ue 
sales and revenues for include only eight months of activity as pszt was acquired in february earnings compared with the international segment s earnings were million  or million higher than earnings 
this increase can be attributed to lower o m expense  an income tax adjustment that benefited earnings in  and additional consideration received in on the sale of a previously written off project 
these were partly offset by a decrease in margin and the negative impact of the decline in the exchange rate  as discussed above 
compared with the international segment s earnings were million  or million higher than earnings 
earnings for reflect a full twelve months of results from pszt  while only included eight months of earnings 
the contribution from these additional months in was offset in part by higher interest expense during in addition  earnings included a million after tax net gain associated with us dollar denominated debt  which did not recur in this debt was converted to a czech koruna denominated loan in december energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging    electricity   other  energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf    compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the primary reason for this increase is the higher gas costs that are reflected in the natural gas marketing revenues 
in addition  higher marketing volumes reflect an increase in nfr customers from  at september  to  at september  almost of the increase in customers were residential customers 
these higher revenues were offset in part by a negative million mark to market adjustment related to certain derivative financial instruments included in other on the table above 
see further discussion of nfr s use of derivatives in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with this increase reflected higher marketing volumes as nfr customers increased from  at september  to  at september  over of the increase in customers were residential customers 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment incurred a loss for of million  a decrease of approximately million over earnings of million 
the most significant reasons for the decrease were mark to market losses related to certain derivative financial instruments of million after tax  the accrual of a million after tax loss contingency on the unhedged portion of this segment s fixed price sales contracts for sale of natural gas to customers in  and higher expenses including interest 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings were million  an increase of million over earnings 
volumes of natural gas marketed increased to bcf in from bcf in and margins were also up from these positive contributions to earnings were partly offset by higher expenses for labor  office expense and advertising 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales    green lumber sales    kiln dry lumber sales    other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales    green lumber sales    kiln dry lumber sales    compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher log sales and kiln dry lumber sales 
log sales are up due mainly to higher board feet of cherry veneer and export logs sold and higher average prices 
the increase in kiln dry lumber sales is due to the operating of additional kilns brought on line in that were operational for a full months in and the addition of two more kilns brought on line in august compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher log sales and kiln dry lumber sales 
revenue growth reflects the increased investment by this segment in timber and sawmills 
earnings compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million when compared with the increase was due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and an after tax gain on the sale of land and standing timber of million 
these items were partly offset by higher interest expense resulting from higher debt related to the pennzenergy company acquisition in july and by higher operating expenses 
compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million when compared with as noted above  timber revenues increased by in these higher revenues were partly offset by higher o m and interest expenses 
earnings growth reflects the increased investment by this segment in timber and sawmills 
other income and interest charges although most of the variances in other income items and interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis other income other income decreased million in compared with this decrease resulted from million of interest income related to the final settlement of irs audits for years which was recorded during  as well as a million gain recorded in which resulted from the demutualization of an insurance company 
as a policyholder  the company received stock of the insurance company as part of its initial public offering 
neither of these items recurred in partly offsetting this decrease was a million gain on the sale of land and standing timber in  as well as million of additional consideration received in on the sale of a previously written off project in the international segment 
other income decreased million in compared with this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income related to the settlement of irs audits 
in and  million and million  respectively  of interest income was recognized related to these audits 
lower other income in also reflects two items recorded in a net gain of million associated with us dollar denominated debt in the international segment and a buyout of a firm transportation agreement by a pipeline and storage segment customer in the amount of million 
partly offsetting these items was a million gain recorded in resulting from the demutualization of an insurance company 
interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in and million in the increase in both years can be attributed mainly to a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding 
long term debt balances have grown significantly over the past several years primarily as a result of acquisition activity in the exploration and production and international segments 
other interest charges increased million in and decreased million in the increase in was primarily the result of higher weighted average interest rates and higher average amounts of short term debt outstanding 
as discussed in financing cash flow below  the acquisition of tri link was financed with short term debt 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from million of interest expense recorded in related to the settlement of irs audits 
partly offsetting this decrease in  interest on short term debt increased mainly as a result of higher average amounts of debt outstanding 
outlook for this outlook for section contains forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
there is no assurance that the company s projections will in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures which may occur in reference should be made to the various important factors listed under the heading safe harbor for forward looking statements that could cause actual future results to differ materially 
the company expects that earnings for will fall within the range of million to million  or per basic common share to per basic common share 
higher earnings in the exploration and production segment is the main driver of the expected increase in earnings for as compared with actual earnings for production estimates for are in the range of to bcfe with oil representing of that production 
spot price assumptions for are per mcf for natural gas and per bbl for crude oil 
information on the exploration and production segment s hedging program is provided in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
in the utility segment  earnings are expected to be down in as compared with the overall rate of return operating income after income tax is expected to be about on an average rate base for of million for the new york jurisdiction and about on an average rate base for of million in the pennsylvania jurisdiction 
these figures compare to s actual return on rate base of in new york and in pennsylvania 
the expected decrease in new york reflects the recent rate settlement with the nypsc whereby rates in the new york jurisdiction are reduced by million for in addition  the rate settlement reduced the targeted return on equity  above which earnings are shared with rate payers  from to 
in the pipeline and storage segment  earnings are expected to increase as the overall rate of return on rate base should increase from in to about to in on an average rate base in of million 
anticipated o m savings is a significant reason for this increase 
in the international segment  earnings for are anticipated to be close to earnings after a reduction for the non recurring income tax adjustment of million that is included in earnings 
in the energy marketing segment  earnings are expected to be at break even or a slight loss 
in the timber segment  earnings for should be flat to slightly up as compared with earnings 
earnings for all other  including corporate  are expected to be flat to down slightly as compared with earnings 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiaries  net of cash acquired investment in partnerships other investing activities short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock dividends paid to minority interest effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes  minority interest in foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for depletion and the impairment of oil and gas producing properties 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s sfv rate design 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the decrease is attributable primarily to higher gas costs in the utility and energy marketing segments stemming from rising natural gas prices 
in the utility segment  any unrecovered gas costs are deferred for future recovery 
partially offsetting this negative impact to cash provided by operating activities  the exploration and production segment experienced an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
higher cash receipts from the sale of oil and gas production resulted from higher production and significantly higher prices 
investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired 
the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures by business segment tota l investments expenditur es capital in fo r corporations long year ended september  millions expenditures or live d partnerships asset s utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international energy marketing timber all other includes non cash acquisition of million in a stock for asset swap 
utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines 
pipeline and storage the majority of the pipeline and storage capital expenditures were made for additions  improvements  and replacements to this segment s transmission and storage systems 
of the total capital expenditures  million was related to the acquisition of another company s interest in the niagara spur loop line and the ellisburg leidy pipeline in january this acquisition was financed with short term borrowings 
the capital expenditures also include approximately million for natural gas wells and related pipelines as well as some undeveloped timber property acquired from cunningham natural gas corporation cunningham in november these assets were acquired through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
in addition to the assets identified above  the company received cunningham s temporary cash investments in exchange for the shares of company common stock 
during  sip made a million investment in independence pipeline company  a delaware general partnership independence  and had an aggregate investment balance of million at september  this investment represents a one third partnership interest 
the investment has been financed with short term borrowings 
independence intends to build a mile natural gas pipeline the independence pipeline from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania at an estimated cost of million 
if construction never begins on the independence pipeline project  the company s share of the development costs including sip s investment in independence is estimated not to exceed million 
on july   the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity the certificate authorizing  among other things  the construction and operation of the independence pipeline  subject to satisfaction of various conditions spelled out in the certificate and in previous ferc orders 
among those conditions is the requirement that  before construction may commence  independence must file at ferc executed  firm transportation agreements with no out clauses for at least of its capacity 
independence already filed  on june and july   precedent agreements for firm transportation amounting to about of the capacity of the independence pipeline  thereby satisfying a ferc requirement previously imposed as a precondition to ferc s issuance of the certificate 
the independence pipeline partners are working on obtaining the required customer commitments 
the certificate also requires that the independence pipeline be constructed and placed in service by july  assuming contracts are in place in quantities satisfactory to the partners  the independence pipeline s planned in service date is november  the certificate also includes an environmental condition that independence file an implementation plan within days after independence accepted the certificate 
in october and november  independence timely filed a preliminary implementation plan which included a request for an extension of time to provide certain technical information  in order to allow the remaining field surveys for example  for endangered species to be commenced in spring this timing would be consistent with independence s planned in service date of november   and the certificate s deadline of july  to complete construction 
on november   a ferc official issued a letter requiring independence to file a full implementation plan  including the necessary technical information  by may   and warning that if independence cannot comply with these terms  its certificate authority could be in jeopardy 
this letter also requires independence to file monthly status reports on environmental permitting and land acquisition activities 
it is possible that independence will be unable to file timely an implementation plan which meets the requirements set out in the november letter  and that independence s application could be dismissed 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment capital expenditures included approximately million for the company s offshore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  offshore construction  lease acquisition costs and geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining million of capital expenditures included onshore drilling  construction and recompletion costs for wells located in louisiana  texas  california and canada as well as onshore geological and geophysical costs  including the purchase of certain d seismic data and fixed asset purchases 
in june  the company acquired the outstanding shares of tri link  a calgary  alberta based oil and gas exploration and production company 
this acquisition built the company s total reserve base to approximately one trillion cubic feet equivalent 
the cost of acquiring the outstanding shares of tri link was approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with short term borrowings

international the majority of the international segment capital expenditures were concentrated in the areas of improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
energy marketing the energy marketing capital expenditures consisted primarily of furniture  equipment and computer hardware and software 
timber the majority of the timber segment s capital expenditures consisted of the purchase of land and timber in pennsylvania  and the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
all other expenditures for long lived assets for all other subsidiaries consisted of the purchase of a interest in a gas processing facility and the purchase of a partnership interest in seneca energy ii  llc which generates and sells electricity to a public utility by using methane gas obtained from a landfill owned by an outside party 
other investing activities other cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily reflects cash received on the sale of investments in property  plant and equipment 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international timber estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the estimated capital expenditures also include million for an increase in horsepower at the ellisburg  pennsylvania compressor station 
in addition  million has been budgeted for the construction of a transmission line from lamont  pennsylvania to roystone  pennsylvania 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the onshore program million in canada 
of this amount  approximately million million in canada is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
the estimated expenditures also include approximately million for the offshore program in the gulf of mexico 
of this amount  approximately million is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
the estimated capital expenditures for the international segment in include approximately million for the construction of a boiler at a district heating and power generation plant in the czech republic 
the new boiler will replace an existing boiler 
other capital expenditures will be concentrated on smaller improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants 
estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated in the purchase of land and timber as well as the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities
