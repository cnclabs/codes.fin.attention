item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the registrant s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the reorganization in june  management of prolong has concentrated a significant portion of its efforts and resources on the marketing and sale of prolong s consumer oriented products  through traditional retail distribution and through direct response television advertising 
management now believes that it has attained a significant level of brand and product identification and prolong has now begun efforts to expand sales of its consumer lubrication products into commercial and industrial channels  as well as international markets 
the lubricant business is extremely competitive 
prolong s business requires that it compete with larger  better financed entities  most of which have brand names which are well established in the marketplace 
although prolong  in the opinion of management  has unique products which have superior performance characteristics relative to the well known products available in the marketplace  prolong remains at a distinct disadvantage and will be required to expend substantial sums in order to promote brand name identity and product acceptance among its prospective customers 
in order to establish brand name identity  prolong has relied primarily on its direct response television programs and intends to continue to utilize this means to gain product recognition for purposes of directly increasing sales as well as increasing retail  commercial and industrial and governmental sales resulting from broader public knowledge of its products

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had net working capital of  as compared to  at december  representing a decrease of  operating activities used  during  primarily from  of losses during the period  a  increase in deferred taxes  a  increase in reserves  and a  increase in accounts payable which were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of  prepaid expenses of  and prepaid television time of  additionally  the company used  for investing activities which were primarily purchases of property and page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries equipment 
these uses of cash were funded during the year ended december  primarily by proceeds from the company s bank credit line in the amount of in july  psl entered into a million line of credit  as amended  with bank of america national trust and savings association bank of america which is collateralized by psl s inventories and receivables 
this line expires on april  bank of america has informed the company that it does not intend to renew the existing line of credit facility

year update as described in the form k for the year ended december   prolong had developed plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the year since entering the year  prolong has not experienced any major disruptions to its business nor is it aware of any significant year related disruptions impacting its customers and suppliers 
furthermore  prolong did not experience any material impact on inventories at calendar year end 
prolong will continue to monitor its critical systems along with customer sites to ensure that no year related disruptions occur 
however  there can be no assurance that issues regarding year compliance will not surface  but we expect these issues if any  to be relatively insignificant 
costs incurred to achieve year readiness  which include contractor costs to modify existing systems and costs of internal resources dedicated to achieving year compliance  were charged to expense as incurred and were not material in page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries factors which may affect future operating results in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which may affect  among other things  our ability to maintain our current sales growth rate or may cause sales to decline 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following 
competitive  technological  financial and business challenges may make it more difficult for us to continue to sell specialty lubricant products 

we may be unable to retain our existing key sales  technical and management personnel 

increased competition in the specialized lubrication or appearance product markets may cause downward pressure on our prices 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

sales to customers who respond to our direct response television commercials may decrease significantly 

the lubricant or appearance products industries or our operations or business may face other unforeseen material adverse changes 
our current expectations  which impact our budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions  are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments 
revisions to our current expectations may cause us to change our marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we believe that our current expectations are reasonable  we make no representation regarding their accuracy 
therefore  you should avoid placing undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
our failure to manage growth could adversely affect us we expect to grow rapidly 
this rapid growth will place a significant strain on our management and financial and other resources 
our ability to effectively manage our growth will largely depend on our success at 
improving our operational  financial and management information systems 

attracting  training  motivating  managing and retaining our key employees 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our operating results  financial condition and ultimately our business could be adversely affected 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future we expect that our need for additional funds will increase significantly in the future as our business grows 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain adequate funds when we need them or on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future need for additional funds will depend on numerous factors including the following page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries 
the success of our product development programs 

the commercial success of our products 

the rate of growth of our business 

the availability of cash from our operations and other sources 
we are currently seeking additional funds through public or private sales of our stock or through borrowing 
the issuance of additional shares of stock could result in a substantial dilution to the ownership interests of our present or future stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may need to delay or scale back our product development and the manufacture of our current products 
any inability to obtain funds when we need them would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
direct response sales will not remain our key source of sales growth sales to retail customers who responded to our minute direct response television commercial  or direct response sales  represented approximately  of our revenues in compared with  of our revenues in in the past  sales to industrial commercial and international customers constituted only a limited portion of our revenues 
however  we expect most of our future sales growth to come from both industrial commercial and international customers and less from direct response sales 
we typically sell to industrial commercial and international customers through independent distributors 
we will need to significantly expand our distributor network in order to increase sales in the industrial commercial and international markets 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully locate and engage qualified distributors for our products  either domestically or internationally  or that our sales to industrial commercial and international customers will grow as expected 
we depend on our key management personnel we depend on our key management personnel and our future success will depend in large part upon their contributions  experience and expertise 
we have entered into employment agreements with of our senior executives for periods ranging from to years 
in addition  our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel 
the loss of any key management personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is subject to the risk of product liability claims the nature of our business exposes us to risk from product liability claims 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with maximum coverage limits of  for each occurrence and an aggregate limit of  per year 
product liability coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we cannot guarantee that our current coverage will adequately cover future product liability claims 
currently  we have no plans to increase our coverage 
however  we will reevaluate our product liability coverage from time to time in the future 
any losses that we may suffer from future liability claims  including the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon our reputation and marketability of our products  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive the current market for our products is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
our principal competitors include other providers of specialized lubrication products  such as the clorox company stp tm and pennzoil quaker state corporation slick tm  both of which market engine oil treatments 
our competitors also include major oil companies such as shell oil company  chevron corporation  castrol  and page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries other companies that manufacture lubrication products  such as wd corp 
further  we believe that major oil companies not presently offering products that compete directly with our products may enter our markets in the future 
with respect to our appearance products  major competitors include such companies as turtle wax  inc  meguiar s  inc  pennzoil quaker state company  and the clorox company 
increased competition could result in any or all of the following  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
price reductions 
reduced gross margins 
loss of market share in addition  many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources and greater market recognition than we do 
several of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial customer bases in the automotive and other related industries 
as a result  our competitors may respond quicker to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote more resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
additionally  other dealers and distributors may appeal to the price sensitive segment of the market by offering similar lubrication and appearance products at prices below ours 
while we believe that our prices are competitive for the level of quality of our products  we rely on our brand name recognition and reputation for selling quality products supported by strong customer service 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the prices of many of our components are highly volatile we depend upon our suppliers to provide us with the primary components for our afmt formula 
the price of such components is extremely volatile and beyond our control or influence 
prices for the quality of components we desire depend on the origin  supply and demand at the time of purchase 
component prices typically depend on multiple factors within the producing countries  including weather and political and economic conditions 
additionally  petroleum products  which form our afmt formula  have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations  such as the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  that have historically attempted to control prices of petroleum products through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting petroleum supplies worldwide 
we cannot guarantee that opec or others will be unsuccessful in raising the prices of petroleum components or that  if prices increase  we will be able or choose to maintain our gross margins by raising our prices without affecting demand 
increases in component prices  for whatever reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have operated as an independent company only since we have only been an independent operating company since june prior to such time  our company was essentially dormant for approximately years  with few assets or operations 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully continue our growth through the expansion of our operations  by accessing new markets or otherwise 
from the reorganization through december  we generated revenues of approximately  and operating losses of approximately  from december through december  our operations have generated net income 
in  we suffered a net loss of approximately  we cannot guarantee our operating success and ability to generate net income in the future 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries we depend on third party suppliers to date  we have succeeded in obtaining enough components from existing suppliers to produce our afmt formula in order to meet our current manufacturing needs 
we also believe that adequate supplies will continue to be available in the near future 
however  we recently increased production and plan to further increase production to meet an increase in demand 
such production increases could put strain on the production capacity of our existing suppliers 
while we continue to work actively with each supplier in order to increase production of our components  we cannot guarantee that each supplier will increase its production in time to satisfy our increased demand or that alternate suppliers will be able to meet any supply deficiency 
if we fail to obtain enough components  or if such components fall below our quality standards  shipments and sales of our products may be delayed or reduced 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our revenue comes from a limited number of products we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from sales of our afmt based products and we expect this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
because our revenues are concentrated in lubricants and appearance products  a decline in the demand for  or in the prices of  our afmt based products as a result of competition  technological advances or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and operating results 
we recently expanded our product line to diversify our limited product mix and we plan to continue such expansion in the future 
however  we cannot guarantee that our new afmt based products will be widely accepted by our customers 
our average selling prices may decline the average sales prices for our products may decline 
recently  competitors and consumers have pressured specialty lubricant suppliers to reduce pricing  which in turn could result in downward pricing pressure on our products 
in addition  our average sales prices decline when we negotiate large volume price discounts with certain customers 
in the short term  we plan to lower our manufacturing costs in order to offset the possibility of declining average sales prices 
in the long term  we plan to develop new afmt based products that can be manufactured at lower cost or sold at higher average sales prices 
if  however  we fail to achieve such manufacturing cost reductions or diversify our product mix  our gross margins could decline 
such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we depend on international sales for future growth and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets international sales comprised of revenues in as compared to of revenues in we plan to expand international sales in the future 
this will require significant financial resources and management attention 
in order to expand sales on a worldwide basis  we plan to do the following 
establish additional marketing and sales operations 

hire additional employees 

recruit additional international distributors 
to the extent we fail to do any of the above  our growth may suffer and our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we run the risk that revenues from our expanding international operations will be taxed by foreign authorities at rates higher than our domestic tax rates 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries currently  our worldwide sales are denominated in united states dollars 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
additional risks inherent in our worldwide business activities include 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers 

costs of localizing products in foreign countries 

longer accounts receivable collection cycles 

difficulties in managing foreign operations 

potential for adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating our earnings 

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
we cannot guarantee that our international sales and  consequently  our overall business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition will be free from any material adverse effect caused by any of the above factors 
our business is subject to the risk of litigation we are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of our business 
in november  a lawsuit was filed by certain epl shareholders against pic  psl  epl and each of our former and current officers and directors 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege breach of contract  certain fraud claims  civil rico  breach of fiduciary duty and conversion  and seek monetary damages 
we  along with psl and each of our directors and officers  deny the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit  although we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this proceeding 
such claims or litigation  or other claims or litigation  could result in a decision that is adverse to us 
a decision adverse to us in this or any other matter could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  litigation  regardless of its merits  could result in substantial costs to us and divert management s attention from our operations 
we could be subject to environmental liabilities or regulatory compliance costs federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances we use in the manufacture of our products and on our facilities 
we have registered our fuel conditioners with the united states environmental protection agency epa 
such epa registrations have no term but require us to notify the epa of any changes in the chemical composition of such conditioners or other information contained in such registration 
we are unaware of any additional governmental approvals required for our products 
we are also unaware of any existing or probable governmental regulations which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we do not manufacture or store significant quantities of our products  any direct costs incurred in complying with environmental laws have been minimal and have not materially affected our business 
we have tried to minimize our economic risk from environmental violations by our manufacturers or bottlers by locating alternative sources of such services 
we believe that our activities and those of our contract manufacturers conform to present governmental regulations that apply to each such entities operations 
additionally  we believe that our current facilities conform to present governmental regulations relating to environmental  land use  public utility utilization and fire code matters 
government regulations could be changed to impose additional requirements on us which could restrict our ability to expand our operations or have an adverse effect on our business 
the adoption of these types of governmental regulations or our failure to comply with the applicable environmental and land use regulations or restrictions on the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liability or could cause our operations or those of our contract manufacturers to be curtailed  relocated or suspended 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries we are controlled by management and certain stockholders as of march   our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders collectively held approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and most other stockholders actions and  as a result  can direct our business affairs 
such concentration of voting power could delay or prevent our company from taking certain actions including  but not limited to  a change in our company s control 
issuances of our preferred stock may effect the price of our common stock our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock 
such issuances could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
issuing preferred stock provides flexibility with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  an issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our voting stock and this may not be in the best interests of some of our stockholders 
we do not currently plan to issue any shares of our preferred stock 
however  we cannot guarantee that the issuance of shares of our preferred stock will not have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock in the future
