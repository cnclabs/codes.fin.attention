cost of revenues decreased  or  to  for the nine months ended december  compared to  for the nine months ended december  cost of revenues  which includes the cost of support  packaging  documentation  royalties and amortization of capitalized software development costs  decreased primarily due the lower volumes of products sold and reduced amortization expenses for capitalized software development costs

the decreases we expected in sales costs due to the release of the majority of our sales staff in march  did materialize but were offset by the increases listed above plus the costs associated with starting up the lido

com  a software development company  incurred operating losses of  for the nine month period ended december  the full amount of this loss is included in income loss before income taxes and minority interest 
the company is required to recognize these losses on its financial statements due to the interest in theport 
com owned by the company s chairman and ceo

com had cash and cash equivalents of  and a working capital deficit of  cash used in operating activities was  for the nine months ended december   as compared to  for the nine months ended december  during we used existing working capital to finance ongoing operations  fund the development and introduction of new products and acquire capital equipment

remaining repurchased shares represent approximately of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december  adam 
com is not authorized to repurchase additional shares at this time 
we incurred a significant increase in our expenditures during the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was a result of our strategy to enter the business to consumer internet market with development of our consumer oriented web site launched in march we hired additional personnel and opened an office in san francisco to execute this strategy 
the internet business space changed rapidly in and we addressed this change by changing our internet focus from business to consumer to a business to business focus 
as a result  we discontinued incurring costs to improve our consumer site and consolidated operations back to the atlanta headquarters 
while this will reduce future expenses  such savings will be offset by our plan to hire additional personnel and incur additional costs in to enhance our business to business internet strategy focusing on the syndication of our content 
certain of these additional expenses in are discretionary and subject to factors such as the timing of hiring qualified individuals of which the availability is tight 
in december  adam 
com issued two notes payable of  each to an officer and director of the company and an outside institutional investor 
both notes bear interest at  payable upon the maturity date

in exchange for  fusion capital received a debenture which is convertible into common shares of adam 
com at either of the fair value on the date of closing  or the average of the two lowest bid prices in the previous trading days to conversion 
the debenture allows for either the company or fusion to initiate conversions into common stock 
through march  the company has issued  shares at an average conversion price of to satisfy the conversion obligation and in exchange for  the unconverted funds are being held in a custodial account and will be reported as restricted cash 
the funds become unrestricted and available to adam 
com as the debenture is converted into common stock 
the debenture does not bear any interest or premium accrual 
we believe that this financing agreement gives adam 
com the necessary funds to continue our expansion and development of our internet strategies 
with this agreement adam 
com has the resources necessary to continue our deployment of our business to business strategy 
additionally  adam 
com has the right to sell another  debenture with the same terms within six months of the closing of the first debenture 
the company currently intends to sell the second debenture as a component of its overall plans to raise capital 
upon the sale of this second  debenture to fusion  we anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the end of calendar we may raise additional funds  however  in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new and enhance existing services and products  to respond to competitive pressures and to possibly acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available in terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities  we may be subject to certain limitations on its operations  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully promote our brand name  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance adam 
com previously recognized the material nature of the business issues surrounding computer processing of dates into and beyond the year and began taking corrective action 
adam 
com s efforts included replacing and testing three basic aspects of its business operations internal information technology it systems  including sales order processing  contract management  financial systems and service management  internal non it systems  including office equipment and test equipment products  and material third party relationships 
management believes adam 
com has completed all of the activities within its control to ensure that adam 
com s systems are year compliant and adam 
com has experienced no interruptions to normal operations due to the start of the year adam 
com s year readiness costs were approximately  none of which was incurred in adam 
com funded these costs through funds generated from operations and such costs were generally not incremental to existing it budgets  internal resources were re deployed and timetables for implementation of replacement systems were accelerated 
adam 
com does not currently expect to apply any further funds to address year issues 
as of march   adam 
com has not experienced any material disruptions of its internal computer systems or software applications  and has not experienced any problems with the computer systems or software applications of its third party venders  suppliers or service providers 
adam 
com will continue to monitor these third parties to determine the impact  if any  on the business of adam 
com and the actions adam 
com must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
based upon adam 
com s assessment of compliance by third parties  there appears to be no material business risk posed by any such noncompliance 
moreover  adam 
com generally believes that the vendors that supply products to adam 
com for resale are responsible for the products year functionality 
in addition  adam 
com currently does not know of any material difficulties encountered by consumers of its products as a result of the year issue 
recent accounting pronouncements in december the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
this bulletin summarizes certain of the staff s views in apply generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
management of the company does not believe that sab will have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million invested in liquid money market funds or bank accounts with average maturities of less than days 
the cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk and we may receive higher or lower interest income if market interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from levels at december  would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows
