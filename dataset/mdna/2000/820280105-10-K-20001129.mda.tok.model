approximately million of the revenue increase was generated by the newly acquired stone webster businesses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from the manufacturing segment increased million or a increase 
the company anticipates significantly higher revenue volumes in the pipe services segment next year compared to fiscal due to stone webster 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the growth in revenue volume during the year 
the company s sales to customers in the following geographic regions approximated the following amounts and percentages geographic region fiscal fiscal in millions in millions united states europe far east pacific rim south america other middle east 
revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal increases were experienced in all domestic industry sectors  with power generation sales accounting for the majority of the increase 
revenues from international projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal all international industry sectors reflected sales increases over fiscal amounts  with the primary increases being in crude oil refining revenues part of the process industries sector and the power generation sector 
for the year ended august   virtually all european sector sales were to the united kingdom 
european inquiries remain strong  particularly in spain 
sales increased in the far east pacific rim region due to work performed by the acquired stone webster businesses 
bidding activity has increased in certain far east pacific rim countries  such as china  taiwan and malaysia 
additionally  on august   the company announced the execution of a letter of intent for the construction of a million  metric ton per year ethylene plant in china 
even though fiscal sales in the south american region increased over the prior year and inquiries are active  the company s short term outlook is uncertain in this region due to general economic conditions and  particularly with respect to venezuela  political conditions 
the company continues to believe that the european  far east pacific rim  south american and middle east markets present significant long term opportunities for the company 
the company s sales to customers in the following industries approximated the following amounts and percentages industry sector fiscal fiscal in millions in millions power generation process industries other industries environmental and infrastructure process industries sector sales include revenues from the chemical and petrochemical and crude oil refining industries  which in prior years have been reported separately 
other industries sales include revenues from the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which in prior years was reported separately 
revenues from power generation projects increased both domestically and internationally 
sales related to domestic power projects increased due to additional work performed for united states customers  including the previously announced million  five year contract for general electric 
international power generation revenue increases resulted from work performed by the newly acquired stone webster businesses 
revenues from power generation projects should continue to increase to the extent the company begins performing work for entergyshaw in fiscal process industries sector sales also increased both domestically and internationally over revenues  principally due to sales to the crude oil refining industry 
environmental and infrastructure sales are primarily domestic and were generated by the newly acquired stone webster businesses 
the gross profit margin for the year ended august   decreased to from for the same period the prior year 
the company is involved in numerous projects  all of which affect gross profit in various ways  such as product mix  pricing strategies  foreign versus domestic work profit margins differ  sometimes substantially  depending on where the work is performed  and constant monitoring of percentage of completion calculations 
the company s gross profit margin has been declining due to the company s increase in revenues related to its erection and maintenance services and the inclusion of stone webster s procurement and construction activities  which generally carry lower margins than fabrication work 
the company expects this to continue during fiscal as a result of the impact on the company s product mix driven primarily by the stone webster businesses 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase resulted from stone webster activity since the acquisition 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from higher sales levels and other normal business expenses 
as a percentage of sales  however  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended august  from for the year ended august  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal due to stone webster  however  the company expects a continual decline in these expenses as a percentage of sales 
interest expense for the year ended august  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
interest expense varies from year to year due to the level of borrowings and interest rate fluctuations on variable rate loans 
prior to the stone webster acquisition and the new credit facility discussed in liquidity and capital resources and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  interest on the primary line of credit had decreased approximately million in fiscal year  compared to the same period in fiscal  due to lower borrowings partially offset by higher interest rates 
borrowings after the stone webster acquisition on the new credit facility added approximately million of additional interest costs in fiscal the remaining  decrease relates to paydowns of debt  offset by interest on assumed stone webster debt 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
the change in the tax rates relate primarily to the mix of foreign including foreign export sales versus domestic work 
based on the company s current mix of foreign and domestic work coupled with an increase in nondeductible goodwill amortization from the stone webster acquisition  the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be higher than that incurred for the year ended august  fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues in the pipe services segment reflected a nominal growth of 
million or 
while the manufacturing segment reflected a decrease of million or 
the company believes that part of the decline in the manufacturing segment revenues was attributable to the price declines due to foreign producers of stainless pipe fittings flooding their products in the us market 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these variances are discussed below 
the company s sales to customers in the following geographic regions approximated the following amounts and percentages geographic region fiscal fiscal in millions in millions united states far east pacific rim europe south america middle east other revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal increases were experienced in all domestic industry sectors 
revenues from international projects decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decline in international sales was primarily attributable to decreases in activity in the power generation sector in the far east pacific region and in the crude oil refining industries in south america and the middle east and in the chemical processing industries in south america 
the company s sales to customers in the following industries approximated the following amounts and percentages industry sector fiscal fiscal in millions in millions power generation process industries other industries process industries sector sales include revenues from the chemical and petrochemical and crude oil refining industries  which in prior years have been reported separately 
other industries sales include revenues from the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which in prior years was reported separately 
although total revenues from power generation projects declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues from domestic power generation projects increased nearly for fiscal compared to fiscal due to new domestic power generation projects  including the start up of a previously announced million  five year contract for general electric in august in fiscal  the company experienced a decline in international power generation project revenues  particularly in the far east pacific rim market due to general economic conditions 
revenues associated with international power generation projects declined in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from the process industries increased in fiscal over the prior year by million 
revenues from the chemical processing industries increased million due to increased domestic activity offset in part by decreased international activity 
the decrease in international chemical processing revenues was due primarily to weak activity in the south american region as a result of general economic conditions 
revenues from the crude oil refining industry for fiscal increased over the prior year million due to increases in domestic project activity exceeding declines in international project activity 
domestically  activity was positively impacted by a large construction project for a refinery in norco  louisiana that accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the company experienced a decrease in revenues from international crude oil refining primarily due to weak activity in south america resulting from general economic conditions and recent political events  particularly in venezuela and the middle east 
revenues from the petrochemical processing industry decreased significantly in both the domestic and international markets during fiscal compared to the prior year by million 
the decrease in revenues from petrochemical processing was primarily attributable to weak global demand 
approximately of the increase in fiscal sales over fiscal in other industries came from the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
the increase in oil and gas exploration and production industry sales was due to sales of a subsidiary that was acquired in july  which were partially offset by reductions in oil and gas project work performed by other subsidiaries 
most of revenues from this sector are domestic 
gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from for the prior year 
the gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased revenues from higher margin projects in the domestic power generation  chemical processing and crude oil refining industries 
the overall increase in demand for domestic power generation related projects has had a favorable impact on margins for those projects 
shaw has historically realized lower overall margins on erection and construction services because the company generally assumes responsibility for providing all materials and subcontractor costs on these projects 
these costs are typically passed through to the customer with minimal profit recognized 
during fiscal  the company entered into a contract for the expansion of a refinery in norco  louisiana which excluded materials and subcontractor costs from the scope of services 
the increase in the gross profit margin was partially offset by continued lower margins on the company s manufactured products due to pricing pressures from foreign imports and lower margins from its foreign operations due to reduced activity in foreign power generation and petrochemical processing industries 
during the second half of fiscal  the company began to experience easing of pricing pressures for foreign imports 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal the increase primarily related to growth of erection and construction services and the integration of shaw bagwell  inc  the company s oil and gas services subsidiary  and shaw lancas  ca  the company s venezuelan construction subsidiary  into its business for all of fiscal for fiscal  interest expense was million  up million from million in the previous year 
interest expense varies in relation to the balances in  and variable interest rates under  the company s principal revolving line of credit facility  which has generally been used to provide working capital and fund fixed asset purchases and subsidiary acquisitions 
additionally  during fiscal  the company used its line of credit facility to purchase treasury stock totaling million 
the company s effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was due to the reduced amount of foreign export sales and a reduced amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the united states federal rate 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operations of million for fiscal for fiscal  net cash was favorably impacted primarily by net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and an increase in advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of million 
offsetting these positive factors were increases of million in receivables  million in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  and million in inventories  and decreases of million in accounts payable  and million in accrued contract losses and reserves 
the increase in advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts resulted from accelerated billing provisions in more contracts 
the increase in receivables and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was primarily attributable to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over fiscal the increase in inventories was due to the procurement of material for current and future sales activities  which are expected to exceed historical levels based upon the company s backlog at august  of approximately billion 
accounts payable decreased primarily due to the payment of some of the liabilities assumed in the stone webster acquisition 
the company acquired a large number of contracts with either inherent losses or lower than market remaining margins due to the effect of the financial difficulties experienced by stone webster on negotiating and executing the contracts 
these contracts were adjusted to their fair value at acquisition date by establishing a reserve of approximately million which will reduce contract costs incurred in future periods and adjust the gross margins recognized on the contracts 
in addition  the amount of the accrued losses on assumed contracts was approximately million 
since the date of acquisition of stone webster  the company reflected an million net reduction of contract costs as a result of these accrued contract losses and reserves 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased million of property and equipment and sold property and equipment for approximately million 
on july   the company purchased substantially all of the net operating assets of stone webster  inc for million in cash including million of transaction costs and  shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
included in the assets acquired was million of cash  therefore  the net cash paid was approximately million 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of ppm contractors  inc ppm 
total consideration paid was  shares of the company s common stock valued at approximately million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
included in the ppm acquisition  the company received approximately 
million of cash 
during fiscal  the company embarked on its first significant project financing participation 
in connection with construction and maintenance work on a refinery project in norco  louisiana  shaw acquired million of interest bearing notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
through november  the company expects to receive additional notes in lieu of interest 
this investment represents a one time investment  although the company may from time to time pursue similar investments on a selective basis 
this type of investment will generally be limited in size to the profit expected to be received from the projects and will carry a return that the company believes will reflect the risk inherent in its investment 
during fiscal  the company did not enter into any additional project financing for its customers 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million provided in fiscal in july  in conjunction with the stone webster acquisition  the company entered into a three year million credit facility  with an aggregate revolving credit commitment of million and an aggregate letter of credit commitment of million 
the facility permits up to million in letters of credit but reduces the revolver in such event to million 
upon the sale of certain of the acquired assets  the aggregate revolving credit commitment is to be reduced to million 
amounts received from other asset sales may result in additional reductions 
the new facility allows the company to borrow at interest rates not to exceed over the london interbank offered rate libor or over the prime rate 
the index used to determine the interest rate is selected by the company and the spread over the index is dependent upon certain financial ratios of the company 
the credit facility is secured by among other things i guarantees by the company s domestic subsidiaries  ii the pledge of the capital stock in the company s domestic subsidiaries  iii the pledge of of the capital stock in certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries  and iv a security interest in all property of the company and its domestic subsidiaries except real estate and equipment 
the company s revolving line of credit has been generally used to provide working capital and fund fixed asset and subsidiary acquisitions 
primarily as a result of this new facility  in fiscal  the company received net proceeds from revolving credit agreements of approximately million and repaid debt and leases of approximately million including million of senior secured notes and million of debt assumed with the stone webster acquisition  both of which were paid off utilizing the proceeds of the new credit facility 
on november   the company closed the sale of  shares of its common stock  in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share  less underwriting discounts and commissions 
on november   the underwriters for such offering exercised an option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock from the company pursuant to the foregoing terms to cover over allotments 
the net proceeds to the company  less underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering  totaled approximately million and were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the company s primary revolving line of credit facility and certain other long term debt 
the company also received approximately million from employees upon the exercise of stock options 
outstanding checks in excess of bank balances decreased million  as a result of the company s entering into its new credit facility 
accordingly  the company no longer classifies its outstanding disbursements as outstanding checks in excess of bank balances 
the million was repaid with the proceeds from the new facility 
during fiscal  the company used its revolving line of credit facility to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock for million including brokerage commissions through open market and block transactions in accordance with a plan adopted by its board of directors 
in september the company s board of directors voted to terminate its stock repurchase plan 
the purchase of treasury stock in fiscal of million resulted from the return of some shares issued in the stone webster acquisition as a result of a contractual commitment to paydown some letters of credit 
other than certain integration costs related to the stone webster acquisition  the company does not expect its capital expenditures for fiscal year to be substantially different from its historical levels 
stone webster had a working capital deficit 
the company assumed a portion of this deficit through its assumption of certain contracts and their related net liability positions 
this working capital deficit is approximately million as of august   which excludes approximately million of remaining non cash liabilities relating to adjusting the acquired contracts to their fair value at acquisition date as discussed above 
the working capital deficit does include the remaining accrued loses assumed on the contracts of approximately million as of august  this working capital deficit represents future net cash expenditures primarily from billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on completed contracts which represents work billed but not yet performed and accruals from expected losses on assumed contracts related to the company s assumed contracts 
the company expects that this working capital deficit will be worked off during this next fiscal year 
the stone webster acquisition agreement contains an adjustment provision that requires the consideration paid by the company to be increased or decreased by the amount of the net assets or liabilities  as determined by the agreement  of the excluded items 
in addition  million of the acquisition proceeds was placed in escrow by the sellers to secure certain indemnification obligations of the sellers in the agreement 
subsequent to august   the parties entered into discussions to amend the agreement to return substantially all of the escrow funds to the company and waive the adjustment provision in exchange for the company s assumption of a previously excluded item 
the company believes that a final resolution will be reached regarding this amendment which would result in a net reduction of the company s purchase price 
such adjustment is not expected to exceed the amount held in escrow 
such an agreement  even if reached among the parties  would also require bankruptcy court approval 
as of august   the company has a positive working capital balance of approximately million 
because the stone webster acquisition has more than doubled the size of its operations and because a number of the contracts assumed in the acquisition will result in negative cash flow in the near term  the company cannot provide assurance that its working capital requirements associated with its ongoing projects at any given point in time will not exceed its available borrowing capacity 
to the extent the company s working capital requirements exceed its borrowing capacity  shaw s operations could be significantly adversely affected 
see risk factors 
on september   the company executed a definitive agreement with entergy corporation to create entergyshaw  a new  equally owned and jointly managed company 
as of november   the company has invested million into the entity  as required under the terms of the agreement 
subsequent to the execution of a letter of intent for this venture on june   entergy and fpl group  inc  the parent of florida power light  announced a merger which will create the largest us power producer with generating capacity in excess of  megawatts 
entergyshaw s initial focus will be the construction of power plants in north america and europe for entergy s and florida power light s unregulated wholesale operations 
on a combined basis  entergy and florida power light have approximately turbines on order for their unregulated operations 
the company expects that the installation of most of these turbines will be managed by entergyshaw  subject to the approval of its joint management committee 
the company estimates that entergyshaw will generate approximately million in revenues per turbine installed 
shaw expects to provide the engineering  procurement  fabrication and construction requirements to entergyshaw for these plants 
under the terms of the arrangement  the company will present engineering  procurement and construction opportunities that it receives after december  for power generation projects to the new company 
the company does not believe that work performed for entergyshaw will require a significant working capital investment due to expected terms of the contract with entergyshaw 
in october  the company closed the sale of  shares including  shares for over allotments of its common stock  in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share  less underwriting discounts and commissions 
the net proceeds to the company  less underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  totaled approximately million and were used to pay amounts outstanding under the company s primary revolving line of credit facility 
the company s primary revolving line of credit facility has been used to provide working capital  and to fund fixed asset purchases and subsidiary acquisitions 
the company also acquired certain assets in the stone webster acquisition which it expects to sell before december  the company acquired a cold storage operation which it expects to realize net proceeds of approximately million when sold 
in addition  the company has an agreement to sell an office building in houston  texas  which would  after paying off the mortgage of approximately million  results in the receipt by the company of net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from these asset disposals will be used to pay down the company s revolving credit facility 
as of august   the company had million drawn on its revolving credit facility leaving availability of approximately million 
the aggregate revolving credit commitment will be reduced by million to million upon completion of the sale of the cold storage business 
however  after application of the proceeds from the stock sale of million and assets sale of approximately million  the company anticipates that it will have substantially all of its credit facility available 
the company believes that working capital generated from its operations and its availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund the working capital deficit acquired in the stone webster acquisition  its capital expenditures  and its normal operations for the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no

the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
see business forward looking statements and associated risks 
demand for the company s products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the power generation and other industries to which the company markets its products and services 
the demand for shaw s products and services depends on the existence of engineering  construction and maintenance projects  particularly in the power generation industry  which accounted for of its backlog as of august  the company also depends to a lesser extent on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical  environmental  infrastructure and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
the company s results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
the acquisition of stone webster may result in working capital requirements in excess of borrowing capacity 
as of august   the company had approximately million of debt outstanding  including million outstanding under its revolving credit facilities 
amounts received from the proposed sale of its cold storage business will reduce the capacity under this facility by a maximum of million 
amounts received from other assets sales may result in additional reductions 
the company cannot provide assurance that its credit facility capacity will be sufficient to meet its needs in the event shaw encounters significant unforeseen working capital requirements following its acquisition of stone webster 
in addition  the company s ability to meet its current debt service obligations depends on its future performance 
this debt level requires shaw to use a material portion of operating cash flow to pay interest on debt 
stone webster had a working capital deficit 
the company assumed a portion of their deficit through its assumption of certain contracts and their related net liability position 
this working capital deficit is approximately million as of august   which excludes approximately million of remaining non cash reserves relating to adjusting the acquired contracts to their value at acquisition date as discussed above 
the working capital deficit does include the remaining accrued loses assumed on the contracts of approximately million as of august  the majority of this deficit was attributable to advanced billings and billings in excess of cost which generally represent work the company has billed but not performed and accruals for contracts on which the company expects losses 
as a result  as of august   the company has a positive working capital balance of approximately million 
because the stone webster acquisition has more than doubled the size of its operations and because a number of the contracts assumed in the acquisition will result in negative cash flow in the near term  the company cannot provide assurance that its working capital requirements associated with its ongoing projects at any given point in time will not exceed its available borrowing capacity 
to the extent the company s working capital requirements exceed its borrowing capacity  shaw s operations could be significantly adversely affected 
additional borrowings to meet ongoing liquidity needs could significantly increase the company s debt service obligations 
these obligations could have important consequences 
for example  they could o make it more difficult for the company to obtain additional financing in the future for its acquisitions and operations  o require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest associated with its debt  o limit the company s operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on its properties and paying dividends  o subject the company to risks that interest rates and its interest expense will increase  o place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors with less debt  and o make the company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
the dollar amount of the company s backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of its future earnings 
shaw cannot provide assurance that the revenues projected in its backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
to the extent that shaw experiences significant terminations  suspensions or adjustments in the scope of its projects as reflected in its backlog contracts  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company defines its backlog as a working backlog which includes projects for which shaw has received a commitment from its customers 
this commitment takes the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or an indication of the amount of time or material shaw needs to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which shaw estimates anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
the company s backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and the company s customers historic maintenance requirements 
approximately million  or  of the company s backlog at august  is attributable to a contract with general electric which requires shaw to fabricate at least of the pipe necessary to install the combined cycle gas turbines to be built by general electric domestically through approximately of this backlog is for power generation projects for which general electric has been engaged and is in various stages of design  engineering and construction  and for which shaw has received a work release or have been notified that a work release is pending 
the balance is for work for which general electric has requested that shaw reserve capacity 
the company cannot be assured that all of these projects will be constructed or that they will be completed in the company s currently anticipated time frame 
on occasion  customers will cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond the company s control 
in the event of project cancellation  shaw may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in the company s backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in the company s backlog for extended periods of time 
if shaw were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in its backlog  the company s financial condition would be significantly adversely affected 
difficulties integrating the company s acquisition of stone webster and other acquisitions could adversely affect shaw 
the stone webster acquisition more than doubled the size of the company  and many of the assets acquired represent a significant expansion of what were formerly smaller pieces of its traditional lines of business 
in addition  the company has acquired some businesses which are new to shaw 
as a result  the company may encounter difficulties integrating this acquisition and successfully managing the rapid growth the company expects to experience from it 
the company and stone webster utilize different information technology systems 
if the company decides to integrate these systems  the company may have difficulty in doing so 
to the extent the company encounters problems in integrating the stone webster acquisition and any other acquisitions  the company could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company plans to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
because the company may pursue these acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  the company may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in staffing and providing operational and management oversight 
the company may not realize its estimated cost savings from the stone webster acquisition 
the company believes that annual cost savings in its recently acquired stone webster operations could be as much as million on a pre tax basis 
the company intends to achieve such savings through reductions in personnel  office lease and business development expenses 
however  the company cannot provide assurance that these cost savings will be realized 
the company may not receive the economic benefits expected from entergyshaw 
on september   the company executed a definitive agreement with entergy corporation to create entergyshaw  a new  equally owned and jointly managed company 
subsequent to the execution of a letter of intent for this venture on june   entergy and fpl group  inc  the parent of florida power light  announced a merger which will create the largest us power producer with generating capacity in excess of  megawatts 
entergyshaw s initial focus will be the construction of power plants in north america and europe for entergy s and florida power light s unregulated wholesale operations 
on a combined basis  entergy and florida power light have approximately turbines on order for their unregulated operations 
the company expects that the installation of most of these turbines will be managed by entergyshaw  subject to the approval of its joint management committee 
the company estimates that entergyshaw will generate approximately million in revenues per turbine installed 
shaw expects to provide the engineering  procurement  fabrication and construction requirements to entergyshaw for these plants 
under the terms of the arrangement  the company will present engineering  procurement and construction opportunities that it receives after december  for power generation projects to entergyshaw 
the company can provide no assurance that all or any portion of the installation of these turbines will be committed to entergyshaw 
further  the company provides no assurance that entergyshaw will contract with the company for the installation of all of these turbines 
the nature of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
shaw enters into fixed price  lump sum or unit price contracts on a significant number of the company s domestic piping contracts and substantially all of its international piping projects 
in addition  a number of the contracts the company assumed in the stone webster acquisition are fixed price or lump sum contracts 
under fixed  maximum or unit price contracts  the company agrees to perform the contract for a fixed price and as a result  benefits from costs savings  but is unable to recover any cost overruns 
under fixed price incentive contracts  the company shares with the customer any savings up to a negotiated ceiling price and carries some or all of the burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates which are subject to a number of assumptions  such as assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if in the future these estimates prove inaccurate  or circumstances change  cost overruns can occur which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of its operations 
shaw s profit for these projects could decrease  or the company could experience losses  if the company is unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from its suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if the company experiences cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
shaw enters into contractual agreements with customers for some of its engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
in some instances  the terms of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in proposed reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
in addition  the company has several significant projects for agencies of the us government 
generally  us government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  to profit and cost controls and limitations  and to provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience and with payment of compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination 
in the event of termination  the company generally receives some allowance for profit on the work performed 
in some cases  government contracts are subject to the uncertainties surrounding congressional appropriations or agency funding 
government business is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
the company s results of operations depend on shaw s ability to obtain future contracts 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when shaw will receive a contract award 
in addition  timing of receipt of revenues from the company s projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients  or labor disruptions 
the uncertainty of the company s contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  shaw maintains and bears the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs under expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  the company would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on it 
projects in the industries in which the company provides products and services frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process 
because a significant portion of the company s sales are generated from large projects  the company s results of operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
shaw s significant customers vary between years 
the loss of any one or more of the company s key customers could have a material adverse impact on it 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which shaw operates could adversely affect the company 
a significant portion of the company s sales is attributable to projects in international markets 
shaw expects international sales and operations to continue to contribute materially to the company s growth and earnings for the foreseeable future 
international contracts  operations and expansion expose the company to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including o uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which shaw makes capital investments  operates and sells products and services  o the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which shaw operates and sells products and services  which could make it difficult for it to enforce the company s contractual rights  o expropriation of property  o restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  and o political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection 
for example  in fiscal  the company s international sales declined due to economic downturn in the far east pacific rim region  resulting in fewer power generation projects  and general economic conditions and political events in south america  causing a reduction in sales to the petrochemical processing industry 
foreign exchange risks may affect the company s ability to realize a profit from certain projects 
while shaw attempts to denominate its contracts in united states dollars  from time to time the company enters into contracts denominated in a foreign currency without escalation provisions 
this practice subjects the company to foreign exchange risks 
in addition  to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs  the company increases its foreign exchange risks 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions or matching the contract revenue currency with the contract costs currency 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect the company 
for instance  prior to the lifting of foreign exchange controls in venezuela in november  foreign exchange controls adversely affected the company s ability to repatriate profits from shaw s venezuelan subsidiary or otherwise convert local currency into united states dollars 
shaw generally does not obtain insurance for or hedge against foreign exchange risks for a material portion of its contracts 
in addition  the company s ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies 
failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
in certain circumstances  the company guarantees facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs and the amount of such additional costs could exceed project profit margins 
performance problems for existing and future contracts  whether fixed  maximum or unit priced  could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by the company 
a dependence on one or a few clients could adversely affect the company 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of the company s consolidated revenues in any one year  or over a period of several consecutive years 
approximately million  or  of the company s backlog is attributable to a contract with general electric  which requires shaw to fabricate at least of the pipe necessary to install the combined cycle gas turbines to be built by general electric domestically through the company has had long standing relationships with many of its significant customers  including customers with which the company has entered into alliance agreements  that have preferred pricing arrangements  however  the company s contracts with them are on a project by project basis and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
shaw s dependence on a few suppliers and subcontractors could adversely affect the company 
the principal raw materials in the company s piping systems business are carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloy piping  which shaw obtains from a number of domestic and foreign primary steel producers 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction services shaw relies on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party sub contractors to complete its projects 
to the extent that the company cannot engage sub contractors or acquire equipment or raw materials  shaw s ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
to the extent the amount the company is required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount the company has estimated in bidding for lump sum work  shaw could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  the company may be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the materials were needed 
the company s projects expose it to potential professional liability  product liability  or warranty and other claims 
shaw engineers and constructs and the company s products typically are installed in large industrial facilities in which system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by the company or where shaw s products are installed could result in significant professional liability  product liability or warranty and other claims against it 
in addition  under some of the company s contracts  shaw must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for its customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against the company for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects shaw is performing expose it to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once the company s construction is complete  shaw may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
the indemnification provisions of the company s acquisition agreements may not fully protect it and may result in unexpected liabilities 
some of the former owners of companies shaw has acquired are contractually required to indemnify the company against liabilities related to the operation of their company before shaw acquired it and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisition 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  the company may incur unexpected liabilities 
the company s competitors may have greater resources and experience than shaw does 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction business  shaw has numerous regional  national  and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
the company s competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major power equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of its customers 
because the company is primarily a service organization  shaw competes by providing services of the highest quality 
the markets that shaw serves require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in pipe engineering and fabrication  competition on a domestic and international level is substantial 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  the company s principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of the company s competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
a failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company s ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining the company s future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to attract and retain such professionals 
in addition  shaw s ability to be successful depends in part on its ability to attract and retain skilled laborers in its pipe fabrication business 
demand for these workers is currently high and the supply is extremely limited 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase the company s costs and liabilities 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning o emissions into the air  o discharges into waterways  o generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and o health and safety 
the company s projects often involve nuclear  hazardous and other highly regulated materials  the improper characterization  handling or disposal of which could constitute violations of federal  state or local statutes  and result in criminal and civil liabilities 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for certain pollutants or waste materials and require shaw to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on the company  or revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits  for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended and comparable state laws  the company may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis of allocation 
the principal federal environmental legislation affecting the company s environmental infrastructure division of its principal engineering subsidiary and its clients include the national environmental policy act of nepa  the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara 
the company s foreign operations are also subject to various requirements governing environmental protection 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which shaw is subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on the company in the future 
shaw has not conducted environmental audits of many of its properties  including the assets the company acquired from stone webster 
the company cannot give any assurance that its operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect the company 
if shaw has to write off a significant amount of intangible assets  the company s earnings will be negatively impacted 
because the company has grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of its assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if the company makes additional acquisitions  it is likely that additional intangible assets will be recorded on its books 
a determination that a significant impairment in value of the company s unamortized intangible assets has occurred would require the company to write off a substantial portion of its assets 
this write off would negatively affect the company s earnings 
the company is and will continue to be involved in litigation 
the company has been and may from time to time be named as defendants in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites and other actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes 
such contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by the company s subsidiaries 
certain of the company s stone webster subsidiaries have possible liabilities relating to environmental pollution 
while the company did not assume these liabilities in connection with stone webster s acquisition  a federal  state or local governmental authority may seek redress from shaw or its subsidiaries and the company may be named as a potentially responsible party in an action by such governmental authority 
while the company would vigorously contest any attempt to make the company responsible for unassumed environmental liabilities  there can be no assurance that the company will not be held liable in connection with such matters in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect the company 
some of the company s employees in the united states and abroad may be represented by labor unions 
shaw experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering its pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
from time to time shaw has also experienced attempts to unionize the company s non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  the company cannot give any assurance that it will not experience additional union activity in the future 
changes in technology could adversely affect the company and its competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
through stone webster  the company believes that it has a leading position in technology associated with the design and construction of plants which produce ethylene  which the company protects and develops with patent registrations  license restrictions  and a research and development program 
this technology position is subject to the risk that others may develop competing processes  which could affect the company s market position 
in addition  shaw s strengths in design and construction software  as well as power generation software  may be at risk from competitive technologies 
the company s induction pipe bending technology and capabilities influence the company s ability to compete successfully 
however  this technology and its proprietary software are not currently patented 
while the company may have some legal protections  litigation brought by the company in this regard could be time consuming and expensive and could prove unsuccessful 
likewise  although the company protects some proprietary materials and processes through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  the company cannot give any assurance that these agreements will not be breached 
finally  there is nothing to prevent the company s competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to shaw s technology 
the company s success depends on key members of its management  including j 
m 
bernhard  jr 
the company s success is dependent upon the continued services of j 
m 
bernhard  jr  its founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key officers 
the loss of mr 
bernhard or other key officers could adversely affect the company 
the company does not maintain key employee insurance on any of its executive officers 
market prices of the company s equity securities could change significantly 
the market prices of the company s common stock  preferred stock or warrants may change significantly in response to various factors and events  including the following o the other risk factors described in this form k  including changing demand for its products and services  o a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  o changes in securities analysts estimates of the financial performance of shaw or its competitors or the financial performance of companies in its industry generally  o general conditions in its industry  and o general conditions in the securities markets 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
the company s articles of incorporation and by laws and louisiana law contain provisions that concentrate voting power in management and could discourage a takeover 
because of special voting power carried by stock owned by the company s officers and directors  as of november   its officers and directors controlled approximately of the voting power of all of its outstanding stock 
consequently  these persons  in particular mr 
bernhard  would be able to exercise significant influence over corporate actions and the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of directors 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that each share of common stock that has been held by the same person for at least four consecutive years is entitled to five votes on each matter to be voted upon at shareholders meetings  and all shares held for less than four years are entitled to one vote per share for each matter 
this charter provision concentrates control in current management and could o increase the difficulty of removing the incumbent board of directors or management  o diminish the likelihood that a potential buyer would make an offer for the common stock  and o impede a transaction favorable to the interests of shareholders 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and by laws and louisiana law may tend to deter potential unsolicited offers or other efforts to obtain control of the company that are not approved by its board of directors 
the provisions may deprive the company s shareholders of opportunities to sell shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
the company s issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect shareholder rights of a holder of common stock and could discourage a takeover 
the company s board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of the company s shareholders 
in the event that shaw issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon the company s liquidation  dissolution or winding up  rights as holders of common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  the ability of the company s board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of the company s shareholders may impede a takeover of the company and prevent a transaction favorable to its shareholders 
any or all of these consequences  should they materialize  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company currently does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the company s future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments and fair value at august  all instruments described are non trading instruments dollars in millions 
fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate long term line of credit variable rate average interest rate foreign currency risks although the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars  the company does have certain of its subsidiaries which conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
the company currently does not use any off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities conducted in foreign currencies unless that particular operation enters into a contract in a foreign currency which is different than the local currency of the particular operation 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  the company will utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or sales 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
as of august   the company has a minimal number of forward exchange contracts outstanding which are hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to the company s results of operations or financial position
