restaurants open at end of period weighted average weekly sales per restaurant    net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the million of sales recorded in represents an increase of million  or  over million of sales reported in the increase was due to the opening of new restaurants two in and one in and to an increase of in weighted average weekly sales per restaurant 
the increase in was primarily a result of new restaurant openings  average weekly sales per restaurant increased by in fiscal contained weeks of operations compared to weeks for both and same store sales  which include comparable results for all restaurants open for more than months  increased to  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales for also averaged  per week  on a base of restaurants  and increased over the  average for management estimates that menu prices were approximately higher in than in and also approximately higher in than the company estimates that guest counts on a same store basis increased by approximately in and declined by approximately in near the end of the third quarter of  however  the company repositioned its menu to place more emphasis on its premium offerings and daily feature items  while de emphasizing certain lower priced menu items 
as a result of these changes and a number of other guest service improvement initiatives begun in  same store sales increased by in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in  with guest counts increasing by approximately to during this period 
same store sales increases have remained in this range during the first two months of restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses decreased to for compared to for both and  with restaurant operating margins increasing to in from in both and the decrease in restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of sales in was a result of a decrease in these costs and expenses in the same store group of restaurants to in from in  with these same store reductions more than offsetting higher costs associated with new restaurants opened during and restaurant operating margins for the same store restaurant group increased to in from in the largest factor contributing to the operating expense decrease in was the decrease in cost of sales resulting from management s emphasis on increased efficiencies in this area and the menu price increases noted above 
another factor contributing to the improvement was the company s decision to change the estimated useful life of its buildings from to years and the estimated life of leasehold improvements to include an amortization period based on the lesser of the lease term  generally including renewal options  or the useful life of the asset 
the effect of these changes  which were implemented as of january   was to decrease restaurant operating expenses for by  or 
of sales 
restaurant operating expenses for the same store group of restaurants decreased to in from in due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes  particularly as relates to labor costs and other operating expenses  which include certain components that are relatively fixed in nature 
as noted in previous filings  certain of the company s newer restaurants have not yet reached their targeted level of sales performance and continue to significantly affect its overall financial performance 
as an indication of this  the company s restaurants opened prior to posted restaurant operating margins of for  while averaging weekly sales of  per restaurant 
restaurant margins for for the six restaurants opened in and were a negative 
on average weekly sales of  per restaurant 
these six restaurants continue to show good progress  however  and averaged sales of  per week in the fourth quarter of the company s four newest restaurants posted losses at the restaurant level of approximately million for management believes that the performance of newer restaurants is attributable primarily to two factors 
the first of these factors is the company s quiet opening approach 
in order to maximize the quality of guest service and successfully complete the extensive training and support of j 
alexander s staff  there is typically little or no advertising or promotion of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
while management believes this approach is the best way to build a new restaurant s reputation and to build sales over time  the sometimes lower initial sales volumes combined with higher expenses associated with the emphasis placed on training and quality of operations during the opening months  typically result in the financial performance of newer restaurants trailing that of more mature restaurants 
the company expects newly opened restaurants to experience operating losses in their initial months of operation 
also  the company believes that certain of its newer restaurants located in mid size  rather than larger markets will take longer to build to satisfactory sales levels than was originally expected 
management believes that all or virtually all of the company s restaurants have the potential over time to reach satisfactory sales levels 
beginning in the company lowered its new restaurant development plans to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants while maintaining operational excellence 
also  in the company established criteria calling for higher population densities and higher household incomes than were met by certain of its previous locations 
the west bloomfield  michigan restaurant opened in was the first restaurant to be opened under these more stringent criteria 
to date  the west bloomfield restaurant has met all of the company s sales expectations 
management remains optimistic about the prospects for j 
alexander s and continues to believe that the primary issue faced by the company in maintaining consistent profitability is the improvement of sales in several of its restaurants  and particularly certain of its newer restaurants 
it believes that actions taken to date  including guest service initiatives which were implemented two years ago  the menu repositioning implemented in the third quarter of  and the change in development criteria  together with continued emphasis on increasing sales and profits are having and will continue to have a positive impact on the company s sales and financial performance for and that the company will be profitable in the company s profit of approximately  for the fourth quarter of provides evidence of significant improvements 
further  only two restaurants one of which was the new west bloomfield restaurant opened in november posted restaurant operating losses in the fourth quarter of  losses at those two restaurants totaled approximately  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include supervisory costs as well as management training costs and all other costs above the restaurant level  increased by  or  in compared to as a percentage of sales these expenses increased to in from in these increases were due primarily to lower than normal general and administrative expenses in which were  in turn  principally due to favorable experience under both the company s workers compensation program and its self insured group medical insurance program which allowed the company to reduce its level of accruals and expense related to those programs for in addition  increases in management training costs which combined with management relocation and procurement costs comprise approximately of the general and administrative category  contributed to higher general and administrative costs during general and administrative expenses increased slightly in fiscal compared to for the year favorable experience under the company s workers compensation program and under the company s self insured group medical insurance program largely offset increases in management training costs and relocation costs for restaurant management personnel 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in due to higher sales levels achieved 
general and administrative expenses for are expected to remain at approximately the same percentage of sales as pre opening expense in the company changed its accounting policy to expense all pre opening costs as incurred rather than deferring and amortizing them over a period of twelve months from each restaurant s opening 
a charge of  was recorded as of the beginning of to reflect the cumulative effect of this change 
as the company only opened one restaurant in and two restaurants in  pre opening expenses  which are typically approximately  per restaurant  were significantly less in those years than the  of pre opening expenses incurred in when four restaurants were opened 
other income and expense interest expense decreased by  in compared to due primarily to reductions in the outstanding balance of the company s convertible subordinated debentures and a reduction in the company s line of credit after applying proceeds from sales of stock in march and june   to the outstanding balance on the line 
net interest expense increased by  in compared to primarily due to the use of the company s line of credit to fund a portion of the cost of developing new restaurants 
other  net expense of  for was the result of expenses associated with the write off of facilities and equipment replaced in connection with various capital maintenance projects which more than offset miscellaneous income categories 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at january  and january   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at january  relate primarily to  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
the recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not likely to be generated in such amounts 
due to the loss incurred in and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized and in the fourth quarter of increased the beginning of the year valuation allowance for these assets by  at december   the company s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was  during both and  management was again unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets totaled  and  at january  and january   respectively 
approximately  of future taxable income would be needed to realize the company s tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards at january  these carryforwards expire in the years through approximately  of taxable income would be needed to realize the carryforwards which expire in and  to use those which expire in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital for the past three years has been for the development and maintenance of its j 
alexander s restaurants 
in addition  beginning in  the company has been required to meet an annual sinking fund requirement of  in connection with its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
the company has met its capital needs and maintained liquidity primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of its bank line of credit and through other sources discussed below 
capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
for  the company had negative cash flow from operations totaling  capital expenditures for were funded primarily by the proceeds from the sale of the company s wendy s operations in and use of the company s bank line of credit 
beginning in  capital expenditures were significantly reduced as a result of the company s lower new restaurant development rate  and cash flow from operations of  represented of the capital expenditures for the year 
for  cash flow from operations of  comprised of total capital expenditures for the year 
the remaining capital expenditures for and along with other needs during both years were funded by use of the company s line of credit and  for  by the sale of common stock as discussed below 
for  the company plans to construct and open one restaurant on leased land in the cincinnati  ohio market 
management estimates that the cost to complete the cincinnati restaurant and for capital maintenance for existing restaurants will be approximately million for in addition  the company may incur capital expenditures for the purchase of property and or construction of restaurants for locations to be opened in fiscal any such expenditures are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites and are not expected to exceed million 
while a working capital deficit of  existed as of january   the company does not believe this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company 
certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  thus virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
as of january   debentures in the principal amount of  had been purchased by the company for use toward satisfying the annual sinking fund requirement of  for this issue for in  the company s board of directors established a loan program designed to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
under the program participants may borrow an amount equal to the full price of common stock purchased 
the plan authorizes million in loans to employees 
purchases of stock under the plan totaled  during  with the remainder of the authorized amount being purchased by february the employee loans  which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity  are payable on december   unless repaid sooner pursuant to terms of the plan 
the company maintains a bank line of credit of million which is expected to be used as needed for funding of capital expenditures and to provide liquidity for meeting working capital or other needs 
at january   borrowings outstanding under this line of credit were  in march of  the term of the line of credit was extended by one year through july  the amended line of credit agreement contains covenants which require the company to achieve specified results of operations and specified levels of senior debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and to maintain certain other financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at january  and  based on a current assessment of its business  believes it will continue to comply with these covenants through july  the credit agreement also contains certain limitations on capital expenditures and restaurant development by the company generally limiting the company to the development of two new restaurants per year and restricts the company s ability to incur additional debt outside the bank line of credit 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit is currently based on libor plus a spread of two to three percent  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the line of credit includes an option to convert outstanding borrowings to a term loan prior to july  in march the company developed a plan for raising additional equity capital to further strengthen its financial position and  as part of this plan  completed a private sale of  shares of common stock to solidus  llc  an affiliate of one of the directors of the company  for approximately million 
in addition  on june   the company completed a rights offering wherein shareholders of the company purchased an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share  which was the same price per share as stock sold in the private sale 
the private sale and the rights offering raised total net proceeds to the company of approximately million which were used to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
amounts repaid can be reborrowed in accordance with the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the company believes that raising additional equity capital and repaying a portion of its outstanding debt will benefit the company by reducing its debt to equity ratio and reducing interest expense and that it will provide greater flexibility to the company in providing for future financing needs 
impact of accounting changes there are no pending accounting pronouncements that  when adopted  are expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
impact of the year issue in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
management estimates the total cost associated with the remediation of its system was approximately  the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly

actual results and experience could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors 
such commitments generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef and seafood vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
