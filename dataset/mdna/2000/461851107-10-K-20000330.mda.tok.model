overview invision technologies  inc invision  or together with its subsidiaries  the company develops  manufactures  markets and supports systems based on advanced computed tomography ct technology for explosive detection systems eds for civil aviation security  for log scanning for the wood products industry and for drug detection applications 
invision was formed in september to design and develop an eds based on ct technology and exited the development stage in upon the first commercial sale of its product  the ctx system 
today the company markets its more advanced ctx system  its next generation ctx system  and its smaller and lighter ctx system 
in addition to these products  the company has other products in development 
to date  the company s ctx system and the ctx system together  the ctx series are the only explosive detection systems certified by the federal aviation administration faa currently deployed for use in the inspection of checked luggage on commercial flights 
in april  the ctx system successfully completed faa certification and the company sold its first ctx system in the third quarter of additionally  in september the ctx system successfully completed faa certification and the company is already seeing interest for this product from both existing and potential customers 
since its first ctx sale in through december   the company has received orders for a total of ctx systems  of which a total of had been shipped 
in october  the company received a letter contract of million with a potential value of more than million over three years from the faa for ctx systems and accessories 
for the years ended december   and  the company had ctx product and service revenues of million  million  and million  respectively  and as of december  the company had in backlog ctx equipment orders and service agreements of approximately million 
in january  the company received an order valued at approximately million from an international customer for multiple ctx systems  accessories and service 
invision s wholly owned subsidiary  quantum magnetics  inc quantum  develops and commercializes patented and proprietary technology for inspection  detection and analysis of explosives and other materials based on quadrupole resonance qr technology  a form of magnetic resonance  and passive magnetic sensing 
its products  most of which are in the prototype stage  include advanced detection systems for such markets as carry on luggage screening  drug detection  postal inspection  and detection of concealed weapons and landmines 
quantum is also a leading supplier of research and development services in the area of qr technology and passive magnetic sensing to a number of government agencies 
in the third quarter of  quantum sold its first qscan eds to the united states navy for mail and other parcel screening applications at an international location 
in  quantum began the development of a sophisticated prototype system  which combines qr explosives detection with metal detection  and is thus capable of detecting both plastic cased and metal cased landmines 
in the fourth quarter of  the unique capabilities of this landmine detection system were successfully demonstrated in a series of department of defense sponsored  blind field tests carried out at fort leonard wood  missouri 
revenues and cost of revenues related to quantum s government contracts were previously reported as a reduction to research and development expense 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the gross revenues and cost of revenues associated with quantum s contracts to conform to the presentation

the company knows of no instances in which its products or its internal computerized systems failed to operate as specified due to date formatting issues associated with calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  and the years    and leap year calculations 
additionally  the company identified those third party suppliers whose products or services are mission critical and developed contingency plans
