item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations offshore marine services the company provides marine transportation  logistics  and related services largely dedicated to supporting offshore oil and gas exploration and production 
marine transportation services are provided through the operation  domestically and internationally  of offshore support vessels 
the company s vessels deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations  tow and handle the anchors of drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work  and provide standby safety support 
the company s vessels also are used for special projects  such as well stimulation  seismic data gathering  freight hauling  line handling  salvage  and oil spill emergencies 
logistics services include shorebase  marine transport  and other supply chain management services in support of offshore exploration and production operations 
operating revenues are affected primarily by the number of vessels owned  average rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet  and the number of vessels bareboat and time chartered in 
since  acquisition transactions and investments in joint ventures that have significantly increased the size of the company s fleet include i vessels acquired in the graham transaction  ii vessels acquired in the and cnn transactions  iii vessels acquired in the mccall transaction  iv vessels acquired and equity investments in joint ventures that owned vessels pursuant to the smit transaction  v vessels acquired in the galaxie transaction  and vi vessels constructed during   and the vessels acquired in the graham transaction  the mccall transaction  and the galaxie transaction and the vessels constructed primarily support the oil and gas exploration and production industry in the us gulf of mexico  whereas  vessels acquired in the and cnn transactions and the smit transaction are employed in foreign offshore support markets 
the company also actively monitors opportunities to buy and sell vessels that will maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its fleet 
since  the company has sold vessels  and at december   of the vessels sold were bareboat chartered in 
at december   the company was constructing crew and anchor handling towing supply vessel that are expected to enter service in rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet are a function of demand for and availability of marine vessels that is closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices which  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for the company during the periods indicated 
year ended december  rates per day worked supply towing supply    anchor handling towing supply    crew    standby safety    utility line handling    geophysical  freight  and other    overall fleet    overall utilization supply towing supply anchor handling towing supply crew standby safety utility line handling geophysical  freight  and other overall fleet rates per day worked is the ratio of total charter revenue to the total number of vessel days worked 
rates per day worked and overall utilization figures exclude owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with the company  joint venture vessels  and managed operated vessels and include vessels bareboat and time chartered in by the company 
revenues for certain of the company s vessels  primarily its standby safety vessels  are earned in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
from time to time  the company bareboat or time charters in vessels 
operating revenues for vessels owned and bareboat or time chartered in are incurred at similar rates 
however  operating expenses associated with vessels bareboat and time chartered in include charter hire expenses that  in turn  are included in vessel expenses  but exclude depreciation expense 
at december   vessels were bareboat chartered in  including under sale and leaseback arrangements  and no vessels were time chartered in 
the company also bareboat charters out vessels 
operating revenues for these vessels are lower than for vessels owned and operated or bareboat chartered in by the company  because vessel expenses  normally recovered through charter revenue  are the burden of the charterer 
operating expenses include depreciation expense if the vessels which are chartered out are owned 
at december   the company had vessels bareboat chartered out  which included chartered to its joint ventures  entities affiliated with its joint venture operations  or the environmental service segment 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure owned bareboat and time chartered in managed joint ventures and pool vessels tmm joint venture smit joint venture other joint ventures seavec pool avian fleet pool formally  saint fleet pool 
overall fleet see business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
vessel operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization 
the most significant vessel operating expense items are wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs  and marine insurance 
in addition to variable vessel operating expenses  the offshore marine business also incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment 
depreciation is a significant operating cost  and the amount related to vessels is the most significant component 
a portion of the company s revenues and expenses  primarily from the company s north sea operations  are paid in foreign currencies 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates during the relevant period 
overall  approximately of the company s offshore marine operating revenues were derived from foreign operations  whether in us dollars or foreign currencies  for the twelve months ended december  the company s foreign offshore marine operations are subject to various risks inherent in conducting business in foreign nations 
these risks include  among others  political instability  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  controls of currency exchange  the repatriation of income or capital  import export quotas  and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
although  historically  the company s operations have not been affected materially by such conditions or events  it is not possible to predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
the occurrence of any one or more of such conditions or events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory drydockings  which are a substantial component of marine maintenance and repair costs  are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked twice in a five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair 
the company follows an asset management strategy pursuant to which it defers required drydocking of selected marine vessels and voluntarily removes these marine vessels from operation during periods of weak market conditions and low rates per day worked 
should the company undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year or drydock and repair a disproportionate number of older vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december    and  drydocking costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
during those same periods  the company completed the drydocking of   and marine vessels  respectively 
as of december   the average age of vessels owned by the company was approximately years 
excluding the company s standby safety vessels  the average age of the company s fleet was approximately years 
the company believes that after offshore support vessels have been in service for approximately years years for crewboats  the level of expenditures which typically increase with vessel age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels or acquiring new or used vessels  or that the company s financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make capital expenditures for such purposes 
operating results are also affected by the company s participation in the following joint ventures i the veesea joint venture  a majority owned subsidiary which operated standby safety vessels in the north sea at december   ii the seavec pool and avian fleet pool which coordinate the marketing of standby safety vessels in the north sea  of which were owned by the veesea joint venture at december   iii the tmm joint venture which operated offshore marine vessels in mexico at december   including bareboat or time chartered in from the company  iv the smit joint ventures which operated offshore marine vessels in the far east  latin america  the middle east  and the mediterranean at december   v the vision joint venture  a majority owned subsidiary which operated offshore marine vessel in the us gulf of mexico at december   vi the logistics joint venture  which provides shorebase  marine transport  and other supply chain management services  and vii other joint ventures which operated offshore marine vessels in latin america  the mediterranean  the far east and the us gulf of mexico

to finance the transaction  energy logistics  inc sold additional shares of its common stock to the company for million  borrowed million from the company  and used existing cash balances 
the company s ownership interest in energy logistics  inc rose to following its recent share acquisition  and from december  the financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows of eli are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
prior to december  the company reported its equity interest in energy logistics  inc as an investment in a or less owned company that was accounted for by the equity method 
on february   the company announced that it signed a letter of intent to acquire all of the issued share capital of boston putford 
boston putford s standby safety vessels  certain joint venture interests and vessels  and fixed assets will be acquired for aggregate consideration of approximately pound million 
boston putford will also receive aggregate consideration of approximately pound million for working capital in the companies at closing 
the purchase consideration will consist of pound million in cash  approximately  shares of common stock  approximately pound million in five year zero coupon notes having a current value of pound million  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the final purchase price is subject to certain closing adjustments 
boston putford s standby safety fleet  including vessels held in joint ventures but excluding vessels managed for third parties  consists of vessels operating primarily in the southern uk sector of the north sea 
consummation of the transaction is also subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence  execution of definitive documentation  and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate procedures in the united states and the united kingdom 
the company expects to consolidate its standby safety services in the uk sector of the north sea into the boston putford operations following completion of its acquisition of boston putford 
environmental services the company s environmental service business provides contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services 
the company s clients include tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators  and pipeline operators 
the company charges a retainer fee to its customers for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of its response services and equipment 
retainer services include employing a staff to supervise response to an oil spill emergency and maintaining specialized equipment  including marine equipment  in a ready state for emergency and spill response as contemplated by response plans filed by the company s customers in accordance with opa and various state regulations 
the company maintains relationships with numerous environmental sub contractors to assist with response operations and equipment maintenance and provide trained personnel for deploying equipment in a spill response 
pursuant to retainer agreements entered into with the company  certain vessel owners pay in advance to the company an annual retainer fee based upon the number and size of vessels in each such owner s fleet and in some circumstances pay the company additional fees based upon the level of each vessel owner s voyage activity in the us the company recognizes the greater of revenue earned by voyage activity or the portion of the retainer earned in each accounting period 
certain vessel and facility owners pay a fixed fee or a fee based on volume of petroleum product transported for the company s retainer services and such fee is recognized ratably throughout the year 
the company s retainer agreements with vessel owners generally range from one to three years while retainer arrangements with facility owners are as long as ten years 
spill response revenue is dependent on the magnitude of any one spill response and the number of spill responses within a given fiscal period 
consequently  spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable periods and the revenue from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities relate primarily to i payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials  ii direct charges to the company for equipment and materials  iii participation interests of others in gross profits from oil spill response  and iv training and exercises related to spill response preparedness 
the company charges consulting fees to customers for customized training programs  its planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises  and other special projects 
the principal components of the company s operating costs are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to sub contractors  equipment maintenance  and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer business 
operating results are also affected by nrc s participation in cpa on the west coast of the united states 
drilling services the company s drilling service business is conducted through chiles offshore  a majority owned subsidiary 
from inception and until july  chiles operated as a development stage company  devoting substantially all its efforts constructing two mobile offshore drilling rigs  raising capital  and securing contracts for the rigs 
in  chiles commenced construction of two premium jackup mobile offshore drilling rigs  the chiles columbus and the chiles magellan  which were delivered to chiles in may and october  respectively 
the drilling service segment s operating revenues are affected by rates per day worked and utilization of the rigs 
the rates per day worked and utilization of the rigs are a function of demand for and availability of rigs  which are closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices which  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
the drilling service segment s operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization 
the most significant variable operating expenses for the rigs are compensation and related expenses for personnel  maintenance and repairs  supplies  and insurance 
in addition to variable operating expenses  the drilling service segment also incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment 
depreciation is a significant fixed operating charge and the amount related to the rigs is the most significant component 
the chiles columbus was placed in service in june at december   it was operating under a multi well contract in the us gulf of mexico 
if all wells currently planned by the customer of the chiles columbus are drilled  work is expected to continue through the third quarter of the chiles magellan was placed in service in november at december   it was operating in the us gulf of mexico under a drilling contract with expected completion in february following this project  the chiles magellan is contracted to provide additional drilling services in the us gulf of mexico with expected completion in june the magellan contract 
under the terms of the magellan contract  chiles received a million advance deposit from the customer against expected contractual revenues under the magellan contract 
failure of the chiles magellan to be available in accordance with certain terms and conditions of the magellan contract could obligate chiles to return the million advance deposit to its customer 
after an initial well  the customer under the magellan contract has certain options to use the chiles magellan  under certain circumstances  for additional wells in the same area for a specified period of time at the then current market rates 
chiles has also entered into arrangements for the deferral  until october  of certain vendor payments totaling million with respect to the construction of the rigs 
chiles has recently entered into a bareboat charter agreement charter for a rig chartered rig constructed for the owner at a us shipyard 
the chartered rig is similar in class to the rigs owned by chiles 
the charter commenced in january upon delivery of the chartered rig from the shipyard 
chiles is presently commissioning the chartered rig in preparation for service in the us gulf of mexico to start in the second quarter of since delivery of the rigs in and through december   utilization and average day rates were and  respectively

the company s offshore marine service segment s operating revenues decreased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to lower utilization and rates per day worked and the sale of vessels 
the adverse effect of reduced drilling and production support activities due to declines in oil and gas prices was partially offset by an increase in operating revenues resulting from the entry into service of vessels both constructed for and chartered in by the company 
operating revenues declined approximately million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due to lower vessel utilization 
demand for all classes of the company s us gulf of mexico fleet was adversely affected and declines in demand for its supply towing supply and utility vessels were particularly significant 
the company s domestic fleet utilization ranged from to throughout and averaged in december  whereas  in  utilization ranged from to 
utilization of the company s offshore west africa supply towing and anchor handling towing supply  north sea standby safety  and far east and other foreign regions anchor handling towing supply and supply towing supply vessels also declined

revenues also declined between years as certain vessels previously operated by the company have been bareboat chartered out 
operating profit 
the company s offshore marine business segment s operating profit declined million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to those factors adversely affecting operating revenues outlined above 
operating profits were also adversely affected between comparable years due to an increase in foreign currency translation losses resulting from the revaluation of dutch guilder cash deposits during periods of a strengthening us dollar 
at december   weak demand and low rates per day worked resulted in the company removing vessels from service  including that require drydocking prior to re entering operation 
the vessels removed from service were primarily from the utility fleet that operated in the us gulf of mexico 
performance based compensation expense for administrative personnel declined between comparable years in response to declining profits 
operating costs also declined between years as bad debt expenses recognized in did not recur in  and the company recovered certain receivables written off in prior periods 
gains losses from equipment sales and retirements  net

see liquidity and capital resources globe wireless investment 
net interest income expense 
in the twelve month period ended december   the company incurred net interest expense  whereas  in comparable periods of  the company realized net interest income 
between comparable periods  funds invested in interest bearing securities declined due primarily to the company s use of cash for the purchase of property and equipment  common stock  and the retirement of certain indebtedness

corporate expenses 
in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december   corporate expenses declined million due primarily to a reduction in performance based compensation expense in response to declining profits 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year offshore marine services operating revenue 
the company s offshore marine service segment s operating revenues increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due primarily to higher rates per day worked by many of the company s vessels operating domestically and in foreign regions 
domestic revenue rose due to improvements in rates per day worked and vessel acquisitions partially offset by vessel dispositions  a decline in the utilization of supply towing supply  crewboats  and utility vessels  and the relocation of vessels to work offshore west africa and in other foreign regions 
revenues earned from the company s operations offshore west africa rose due primarily to the relocation of vessels into the region  improved rates per day worked  additional chartered in vessels  and vessel acquisitions partially offset by vessel dispositions 
revenues earned from the company s operations in the far east and latin america rose due primarily to higher rates per day worked  additional chartered in vessels  and vessel acquisitions offset by vessel dispositions and the relocation of equipment to offshore west africa 
revenues earned from the company s operations in the north sea declined due to vessel dispositions and the relocation of vessels to other foreign regions offset by the effect of higher rates per day worked 
operating profit 
the company s offshore marine service segment s operating profit increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due to factors affecting operating revenue as outlined above offset by higher costs associated with i crew wages  ii administration as discussed below  iii repairs and maintenance  iv bareboat and time charters in  v a vessel construction contract cancellation  and vi crew travel 
domestic and foreign crew wages rose in response to competition for qualified personnel in an active offshore market 
main engine and hull repair costs rose primarily in response to greater running time of the company s crewboats 
electronic and communication costs rose due to the installation and use of additional communication equipment aboard vessels working domestically and in foreign regions 
bareboat charter expense rose domestically in connection with the company s sale and leaseback of vessels 
charter expense also rose in foreign operations due to the addition of vessels to the company s fleet 
certain fees and expenses were incurred domestically pursuant to the cancellation of a contract for the construction of a supply vessel 
crew travel expenses rose due primarily to the relocation of vessels from domestic to foreign markets and an increase in the frequency of crew rotation aboard other vessels working offshore west africa 
these cost increases were offset by a decline in domestic drydocking expenses due primarily to the disposition and drydock deferral of certain vessels 
gains losses from equipment sales and retirements  net 
net gains from equipment sales and retirements decreased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  during  net gains from equipment sales and retirements aggregated million  resulting primarily from the sale of offshore marine vessels towing supply of which were bareboat chartered in  anchor handling towing supply of which were bareboat chartered in  utility  supply of which were bareboat chartered in  and crew

the decrease in gains between comparable periods was due primarily to a decline in the number of offshore marine vessels sold and the increase in the deferral of gains associated with sale and leaseback transactions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  gains from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred to the extent of the present value of minimum lease payments and are credited to income as a reduction in rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
equity in net earnings of or less owned companies 
equity earnings from or less owned companies increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the increase primarily related to a million and million gain from the sale of an offshore marine vessel by the tmm joint venture and the smit joint ventures  respectively

corporate administrative expenses also increased between the comparable twelve month periods due to higher wage and legal costs 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  construct  or improve equipment and make other investments 
management believes that cash flow from operations will provide sufficient working capital to fund the company s operating needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its offshore marine service vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
the financial statements of the company s united kingdom operations are measured using the pound sterling and changes in the strength of that currency relative to the us dollar and the corresponding adjustment to the net assets of those operations caused by exchange rate fluctuations result in the recognition of currency translation adjustments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
to protect certain of the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of us dollar cash flows to be derived from the net assets 
the company considers these forward exchange contracts as economic hedges of a net investment as the translation adjustments resulting from the forward exchange contracts move in the opposite direction from the translation adjustments resulting from the restatement of its united kingdom subsidiaries net assets 
at december   the notional and fair values of those forward exchange contracts  which expire at various dates through october  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate of the company s forward exchange contracts at december  was approximately

the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline which over time  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows

the company has provided the financial institution with cash collateral of million  which will be released to the company should the aggregate exposure under the swap agreements be reduced to less than million 
upon termination of each swap agreement  the financial institution has agreed to pay to the company the amount  if any  by which the fair market value of the notional amount of chiles notes subject to the swap agreement on such date exceeds the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreement  and the company has agreed to pay to such financial institution the amount  if any  by which the agreed upon price of such notional amount exceeds the fair market value of such notional amount on such date 
each swap agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of the redemption in full or maturity of the chiles notes  at any time at the election of the company or  at the election of the financial institution  on april  at december   the market value of such swaps as of such date was approximately million
