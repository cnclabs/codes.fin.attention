results of operations net income in was million  an increase of million from the level of million and compared to million reported in basic earnings per share increased per share in to 
the period was impacted negatively by a number of merger and other related charges totaling million which resulted in a decrease of per share on a pre tax basis for these charges include merger expenses for the acquisition of southwest national corporation  early retirement and postretirement benefit accruals and premises and equipment expenses to standardize depreciation methods 
excluding merger and related charges  gains on sale of loans and branches  securities transactions and extraordinary items  basic earnings per share increased or for compared to extraordinary items for resulted from a single transaction whereby the corporation incurred a cost of thousand for the prepayment of fhlb term borrowings

b income on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis  and the loan balances are included in interest earning assets 
c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis both interest income and interest expense increased over levels as volume increases for were only partially offset by rate decreases 
average interest earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million in asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points during to  from reported in and compared to reported in the cost of funds for decreased basis points from costs of and compared to costs of for interest and fees on loans decreased million for over levels and included decreases in interest on mortgage loans of million and decreases in interest on credit card loans of million which were primarily the result of loan sales 
average mortgage loans for the period decreased million compared to averages  as a result of the sale of million and million of family residential mortgage loans in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively 
average credit card loans for the period decreased million as million of consumer credit card loans were sold in the second quarter of the decreased income from mortgage and credit card loans in was partially offset by increased income from commercial loans as enhanced marketing strategies enabled the corporation to capitalize on lending opportunities with small to mid sized commercial customers 
the loan portfolio also reflected decreases due to rate of million during as the decline in loan yields which began in the fourth quarter of has continued throughout and loan yields declined basis points during to from reported for and compared to during the loan portfolio continued to be impacted by loan refinancings and loans maturing at higher interest rates than current market rates 
loan refinancings and prepayments slowed throughout as market interest rates rose 
mortgage portfolio yields rose basis points for compared to as yields on innovative loan products introduced in previous years began to approach the average yield of the mortgage portfolio as these products aged and introductory interest rates were no longer offered on aged loans 
interest income on investments increased million for compared to as average balances of us government agency securities and asset backed securities for increased million and million  respectively over averages 
these securities purchases were part of a capital management leveraging strategy whereby borrowings from the federal home loan bank classified as long term debt were invested in us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
interest income for was also impacted by volume increases from corporate securities  primarily investments in trust preferred securities 
yields on investments for were compared to for and for yields on investments for the period reflected an increase in yields on us government agency securities of basis points and an increase in yields on corporate securities of basis points for the period compared to prepayment speeds of mortgage backed securities mbs which had accelerated during began to slow during the period as interest rates rose 
the primary risk of owning mbs relates to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayment speeds generally decline  resulting in a longer average life of a mbs 
conversely as interest rates decline  prepayment speeds increase  resulting in a shorter average life of a mbs 
using computer simulation models  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbss under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued interest on deposits decreased million for compared to as rate decreases were only partially offset by volume increases 
interest on total savings deposits decreased million and interest on time deposits decreased million for due to rate decreases and a decline in the interest rate environment  particularly early in the year 
deposit costs for total savings deposits reflected a decrease of basis points for while the cost of time deposits reflected a decrease of basis points over costs  primarily as a result of active interest rate management 
volume increases for deposits in occurred primarily in products offering higher interest rates than traditional products such as the corporation s american dream savings product utilized by consumers and the secured cash manager product utilized by municipalities 
the secured cash manager product allows the municipality to sweep excess balances from noninterest bearing accounts into an interest bearing account which offers higher interest rates than traditional now accounts 
average balances of noninterest bearing demand deposits for reflected an increase of million compared to averages 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million during primarily as a result of increases in average borrowings of million over averages 
increases in interest expense on short term borrowings as a result of volume increases during were partially offset by rate decreases as the cost of short term borrowings decreased basis points over costs 
interest expense on long term debt increased million for the period compared to primarily as a result of increases in average borrowings of million over averages 
the long term debt increase for included borrowings from the federal home loan bank with maturities of up to years to be utilized as part of the above mentioned capital management leveraging strategy 
the average spread of this leverage strategy was approximately during the period and during the period 
during and interest income before taxes on these investments exceeded the funding costs by million and million  respectively 
total long term debt for also included increases resulting from the funding of the repurchase of million shares of the corporation s common stock through a modified dutch auction tender offer 
the aggregate amount of million paid by the corporation in connection with the repurchase of common shares was funded through the issuance of capital securities and the issuance of a bank loan from an unrelated financial institution 
capital securities in the amount of million were issued during bearing an interest rate of and maturing in thirty years 
interest expense on capital securities for was million 
the parent company incurred a million bank loan during primarily to fund the remaining cost of the stock repurchase

the provision for credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in the period contains an additional provision of million recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect changing economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses was million at december   for a ratio of of actual loans outstanding 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans outstanding as of december  has decreased slightly from the reported as of december   but this ratio remains above historic levels 
net charge offs for reflected decreases in consumer installment and revolving credit loans of thousand and commercial loans secured by real estate of thousand which were partially offset by increases in net charge offs of family residential mortgages and commercial loans not secured by real estate

this transaction was executed as part of the corporation s repositioning of its balance sheet to reduce exposure to declining interest rates 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
increased competition from nonbanking sources such as mutual funds  insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms have required banks to rely more heavily on alternative funding from other borrowings 
many of our competitors have significantly greater resources financial and other than us and may offer certain services that our banks do not provide at this time 
in addition certain of our banks competitors are not subject to the regulation and supervision to which we and our banks are subject  and therefore may have competitive advantages over our banks and us 
the impact of increased competition for deposits could become more consequential in the future 
the corporation monitors liquidity through regular computations of prescribed liquidity ratios 
the corporation actively manages liquidity within a defined range and has developed liquidity contingency plans  including ensuring availability of alternate funding sources to maintain liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
in addition to the previously described funding sources the corporation s ability to access the capital markets was demonstrated during through the issuance of million of capital securities and a million bank loan to provide funding for stock buy back 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
core deposits decreased million in while total deposits increased million for non core deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december   up from of total deposits at december  non core deposits increased by million in primarily as a result of an increase in public funds 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less    over months through months    over months through months    over months    total    net loans increased million during as commercial loans secured by real estate and commercial loans not secured by real estate increased by million and million respectively  compared to year end increases during for commercial loans were partially offset by decreases in loans secured by residential real estate and decreases in loans to individuals 
the reduction in residential mortgage loans was primarily the result of the sale of million of residential mortgages in march of the mortgage loans were sold to reduce the corporation s prepayment first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis risk and to shorten the average life of the fixed rate loan portfolio 
the reduction in loans to individuals was primarily the result of the sale of million of consumer credit card loans in june of below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction      real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      net leases      gross loans and leases      unearned income      total loans  and leases net of unearned income      an additional source of liquidity is marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of  million and an approximate fair value of  million 
gross unrealized gains were thousand and gross unrealized losses were million 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed to be more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity

first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis interest sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps when measured over a variety of time periods may be helpful 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceeds interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings    total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis although the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twenty four month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or downward from the base case scenario 
the corporation s current asset liability management policy indicates that a basis point change in interest rates up or down cannot result in more than a change in net interest income when compared to a base case without board approval and a strategy in place to reduce interest rate risk below the established maximum level 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point movement in interest rates in either direction over the next twelve months would not have a significant impact on the corporation s anticipated net interest income over that time nor over the next twenty four months and the corporation s position would remain well within current policy guidelines 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset disposition  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management and are approved by the corporation s board of directors

the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation  and terms 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement  and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card  or revolving credit transactions 
consumer creditworthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources  and past credit history 
the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses which are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific allowance for primary watch list classified loans  an allowance based on historical trends  an additional allowance for special circumstances  and an unallocated portion 
the corporation consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology and procedure at the subsidiary bank level 
the allowance for primary watch list classified loans addresses those loans maintained on the corporation s primary watch list which are assigned a rating of substandard  doubtful  or loss 
substandard loans are those with a well defined weakness or a weakness which jeopardizes the repayment of the debt 
a loan may be classified as substandard as a result of impairment of the borrower s financial condition and repayment capacity 
loans for which repayment plans have not been met or collateral equity margins do not protect the corporation may also be classified as substandard 
doubtful loans have the characteristics of substandard loans with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of presently existing facts and conditions  is highly improbable 
although the possibility of loss is extremely high for doubtful loans  the classification of loss is deferred until pending factors  which might improve the loan  have been determined 
loans rated as doubtful in whole or in part are placed in nonaccrual status 
loans which are classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for credit losses at the next meeting of the corporation s credit committee after placement in this category 
there were no loans classified as loss on the primary watch list as of december  loans on the primary watch list may also be impaired loans  which are defined as nonaccrual loans or troubled debt restructurings which are not in compliance with their restructured terms 
each of the classified loans on the primary watch list are individually analyzed to determine the level of the potential loss in the credit under the current circumstances 
the specific reserve established for these criticized and impaired loans is based on careful analysis of the loan s performance  the related collateral value  cash flow considerations and the financial capability of any guarantor 
the allowance for primary watch list classified loans is equal to the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for the individual classified loans on the watch list 
primary watch list loans are managed and monitored by assigned account officers within the corporation in conjunction with senior management 
the allowance based on historical trends uses charge off experience of the corporation to estimate potential unconfirmed losses in the balances of the loan and lease portfolios 
the historical loss experience percentage is first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis based on the charge off history for the twenty most recent quarters 
historical loss experience percentages are applied to all non classified loans to obtain the portion of the allowance for credit losses which is based on historical trends 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances which are subject to guarantee by a government agency 
loan balances are also adjusted for unearned discount on installment loans 
the additional allowance for special circumstances provides management with the opportunity to estimate additional potential allowance amounts which may be needed to cover specific factors 
the specific factors that management currently evaluates consist of portfolio risk or concentrations of credit  off balance sheet risk  economic conditions  management or staff considerations  and comparative peer analysis variances 
portfolio risks include unusual changes or recent trends in specific portfolios such as unexpected changes in the trends or levels of delinquency or charge offs  unusual repossession activities or large levels of unsecured loans in a portfolio 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential credit loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential credit losses is performed these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
however  for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses at december according to the categories indicated allocation of the allowance for credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total      allowance as percentage of average total loans other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

the level of nonperforming loans at year end increased million over levels as a result of increases in nonaccrual loans 
increases for nonaccrual commercial loans secured by real estate  commercial loans not secured by real estate and construction loans of million  million and million  respectively were partially offset by decreases of million for nonaccrual loans secured by residential real estate 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans for also increased over levels 
although the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans of at december  has decreased over levels  this ratio has not decreased below historic levels 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital decreased million in to million 
on july   the corporation announced that the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million shares post split of its outstanding common stock 
the corporation purchased  shares in a modified dutch auction which reduced equity by million for the cost of the shares

the market value adjustment to securities available for sale decreased equity by million 
amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends reduced equity by thousand 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis capital resources continued a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
year analysis the corporation began evaluating the size and complexity of the year issue during project teams were established to identify and prioritize critical systems and processes affected by the year date change 
by fully dedicating numerous technical staff from commonwealth systems corporation  the corporation s data processing subsidiary and utilizing additional staff from various functional areas  multiple computer systems were addressed concurrently 
all mission critical systems operated as expected when the date changed to january  the corporation s greatest asset in successfully dealing with the year issue was its dedicated staff 
the corporation utilized internal resources to evaluate  reprogram and test software and hardware for year issues to the extent possible 
salary and benefit costs related to year activities were expensed as incurred 
external year expenditures included amounts for capitalized hardware and software which will be amortized over three years for software and five years for hardware 
in most cases  the new software and hardware offer additional benefits in processing capability or efficiencies gained from modernization in addition to achieving year compliance 
mainframe software and hardware replaced will result in enhancements or features of potential benefit in serving banking customers or processing financial transactions 
year expenditures which were expensed as incurred during the past three years included the cost of leased off site testing of mainframe systems  outside professionals utilized for independent verification  travel and lodging during off site testing and vendor testing 
cash outlays were funded through operating cash flows 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis year analysis continued the following table summarizes year expenditures during  and dollar amounts in thousands months months months ended ended ended capitalized hardware and software non employee expenses including testing employee related costs  subtotal   capitalized hardware and software replaced without acceleration due to year  total expenditures   inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analysis and monitoring of its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
