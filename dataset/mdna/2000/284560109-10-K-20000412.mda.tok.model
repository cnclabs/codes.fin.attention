item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust that invests principally in senior housing and other healthcare facilities  including skilled nursing facilities  assisted and independent living facilities and medical office and other buildings 
the company conducts primarily all of its operations through the operating partnership  of which eldertrust is the sole general partner 
the company s consolidated assets consist primarily of the assets of the operating partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries 
as of december   skilled nursing  assisted and independent living facilities comprised approximately of the company s consolidated investments in real estate properties and loans 
approximately of the company s consolidated assets at december  consisted of real estate properties leased to or managed by and loans on real estate properties made to genesis or genesis equity investees 
revenues recorded by the company in connection with these leases and borrowings aggregated million in in addition  the company s equity investees have also leased properties to genesis or genesis equity investees 
as a result of these relationships  the company s revenues and ability to meet its obligations depends  in significant part  upon o the ability of genesis and genesis equity investees to meet their lease and loan obligations  o the revenues derived from  and the successful operation of  the facilities leased to or managed by genesis or genesis equity investees  and o the ability of these entities to successfully complete the development projects securing the construction loans made by the company to these entities 
on march   genesis and multicare announced the beginning of debt restructuring discussions with their senior lenders with the intention of revising their respective capital structures 
genesis also announced that it did not make a million interest payment to its senior debt lenders due march  both genesis and multicare announced their intention not to make interest and principal payments on senior debt and have been prohibited by their senior lenders from making any scheduled interest payments on their publicly traded subordinated debt while discussions were ongoing 
each company cited their inability to sell assets due to the lack of long term care market financing and the continuing effect of reduced medicare payments as the causes of these actions 
the senior lenders have given genesis and multicare a day forbearance period to develop a restructuring plan 
shortly after the announcement  moody s investors service issued a press release announcing that it had downgraded the debt ratings of genesis and multicare 
in its press release  moody s indicated that the ratings outlook for both companies was negative 
moody s stated that its rating action reflected the deterioration in the companies operating results and financial condition which has stemmed from the impact of pps for medicare combined with high leverage 
moody s noted that despite cost cutting efforts  operating margins for both companies remain depressed  and planned asset divestitures have not materialized as anticipated 
moody s also stated that restructuring efforts could be adversely impacted by the currently difficult state of the long term care sector  with several large providers already filing for bankruptcy in recent months 
standard poor s also downgraded the debt ratings of genesis and multicare 
management of genesis and multicare have advised the company that they expect genesis and multicare to continue to make all lease and loan payments to the company 
the company has no control over genesis or multicare  however  and can make no assurance that either of these entities will have sufficient income or assets to enable them to satisfy their obligations under the leases or loans made by the company to them 
any failure by genesis or multicare to continue making payments to the company could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain distributions at current levels or at all and could adversely affect the ability of the company to meet its own debt obligations 
if genesis and multicare were to cease making lease and loan payments to the company  the company may be required to restructure or terminate the underlying leases and may foreclose on the loans  in which event  the company might be required to find new operators to operate the properties underlying the leases and loans 
under these circumstances  the company s net income could decline as a result of such restructuring with genesis or multicare or could decline due to rents obtainable from any new operator 
depending on the magnitude of the reduction in the company s net income  the company would seek to offset the effect of such reduction in net income on the company s ability to meet its debt service requirements by further reducing the cash distributions paid to the company s shareholders and minority interests  through asset sales or through other available means 
the company believes that it has the ability to  and  if necessary  intends to  take these actions available to it and  as a result  believes it will be able to continue to satisfy its debt and operating obligations as they come due over the next twelve months 
based on the current quarterly cash distribution rate of per common share announced in november  annualized distributions to shareholders and minority interests would approximate million during  based on the number of common shares and units currently outstanding 
during  the company s cash flow from operations exceeded its debt service requirements and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interests by million 
giving effect to the current quarterly cash distribution rate and year debt service requirements as of december   the company s cash flow from operations during would have exceeded its debt service requirements and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interests by million

any failure by genesis or multicare to continue making lease or loan payments to the company could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain distributions at current levels or at all and could adversely affect the ability of the company to meet its own debt obligations

the credit facility currently matures on june  if the company is unable to pay off or obtain replacement financing by june   or is unable to negotiate a further extension of the current credit facility at that time  or for any reason the company were to be in default under the credit facility prior to its maturity  deutsche bank could exercise its right to foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility  which would have a significant adverse affect on the company s ability to continue its operations and meet its obligations  including payment of quarterly shareholder distributions 
moreover  if the company is unable to raise additional capital through equity financing  or is unable to increase its borrowing capacity  the company may be limited in its ability to fully fund its long term capital needs 
the interest rate  loan extension fee and loan principal amortization under the terms of the credit facility extension  as well as the higher interest expense under the new mortgage financing  will reduce the company s cash flows and could affect its ability to maintain distributions to its shareholders at current levels 
future increases in interest rates  as well as any defualts by tenants or borrowers on their leases or loans  also could adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay its obligations and make distributions at current levels 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue making distributions to its common shareholders at current levels or at all 
to qualify as a reit  the company must distribute to its shareholders each year at least for taxable years beginning after december  of its net taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
if the company is unable to make required shareholder distributions  then the company may be unable to qualify as a reit and be subject to federal income taxes 
facilities owned by the company and leased to third parties under percentage and minimum rent triple net leases require the lessee to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation of such facilities 
facilities owned by the company and subject to percentage and minimum rent leases represent approximately of the company s investments in owned facilities at december  as a result of these arrangements  the company does not believe it will be responsible for significant expenses in connection with the facilities during the terms of the leases 
the company anticipates entering into similar leases with respect to additional properties acquired 
however  there can be no assurance the company will not be responsible for significant expenses of its leased properties in the event one or more of its lessees default on their leases with the company 
in august  the company implemented a share repurchase program 
under the share repurchase program  the company was authorized from time to time to repurchase shares in open market transactions up to an amount equal to the company s excess cash flow on a quarterly and cumulative basis 
in march  in light of the company s cash position and credit facility negotiations  the company suspended the share repurchase program 
in november  the company reinstituted the share repurchase program on a limited basis 
the company completed this limited share repurchase program in december with the repurchase of  common shares at an average price of 
the company repurchased and effectively retired  and  common shares for an aggregate purchase price of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these shares are reflected as a reduction of shares issued and outstanding in the accompanying financial statements 
distributions to shareholders subsequent to year end the board of trustees declared a cash distribution on january  the cash distribution of per share was paid on february  to common shareholders of record on january   and reflects a reduction from the quarterly distribution rate of per share paid in prior periods 
funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in march defines funds from operations as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes funds from operations using standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities using generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
effective january   funds from operations will include both recurring and non recurring results of operations  except those results defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses from sales of depreciable property

these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity  long term mortgages and borrowings under the revolving lines of credit 
during inflationary periods  which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates  the company s ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs

genesis also announced that it did not make a million interest payment to its senior debt lenders due march  both genesis and multicare announced their intention not to make interest and principal payments on senior debt and have been prohibited by their senior lenders from making any scheduled interest payments on their publicly traded subordinated debt while discussions were ongoing 
each company cited their inability to sell assets due to the lack of long term care market financing and the continuing effect of reduced medicare payments as the causes of these actions 
the senior lenders have given genesis and multicare a day forbearance period to develop a restructuring plan 
shortly after the announcement  moody s investors service issued a press release announcing that it had downgraded the debt ratings of genesis and multicare 
in its press release  moody s indicated that the ratings outlook for both companies was negative

management of genesis and multicare have advised the company that they expect genesis and multicare to continue to make all lease and loan payments to the company 
the company has no control over genesis or multicare  however  and can make no assurance that either of these entities will have sufficient income or assets to enable them to satisfy their obligations under the leases or loans made by the company to them 
any failure by genesis or multicare to continue making payments to the company could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain distributions at current levels or at all and could adversely affect the ability of the company to meet its own debt obligations 
proposed loan restructurings and related matters the company previously was obligated to purchase and leaseback  upon the maturity of the related loan or the facility reaching stabilized occupancy  five assisted living facilities mifflin  coquina place  lehigh  berkshire and harbor place securing term loans and two assisted living facilities oaks and sanatoga securing construction loans made by the company in january of these seven loans  which had an aggregate principal balance at december  of million  three loans  secured by the mifflin  coquina place and oaks facilities  were made to wholly owned subsidiaries of genesis  three loans  secured by the lehigh  berkshire and sanatoga facilities  were made to wholly owned subsidiaries of multicare and one loan  secured by the harbor place facility  was made to a genesis equity investee 
the company believes it is no longer bound by the purchase and leaseback obligations contained in the loan documents because the borrowers have  from time to time  not complied with all loan provisions 
the company and the borrowers have extended the maturity date of the five term loans through april  to permit them to negotiate and document a proposed restructuring of the relationships among the parties 
the terms of the transaction being contemplated do not indicate that the company s mortgage loans are impaired at december  under the proposed restructuring  the company would acquire the lehigh  berkshire and sanatoga facilities in exchange for the release of the company s loans to the subsidiaries of multicare 
the company would then net lease these properties to subsidiaries of genesis for an initial lease term of years  with three five year renewal options 
in addition  the maturity date on the loans for mifflin  coquina place  oaks and harbor place would be extended to april  as part of the proposed restructuring  the company also would transfer to genesis the company s phillipsburg skilled nursing facility and certain other assets in exchange for the improvements genesis is making on the company s rittenhouse skilled nursing facility 
the existing rittenhouse lease would be amended to  among other things  increase the annual rent to an amount which equals the sum of the annual rents on the current separate leases for phillipsburg and rittenhouse 
in addition  the heritage woods percentage rent lease would be converted into a minimum rent lease  and the willowbrook lease would be set permanently as a minimum rent lease 
finally  if genesis refinances the oaks  harbor place  coquina and mifflin loans with a third party and does not receive sufficient loan proceeds to cover the existing loan balances  and once the credit facility is fully repaid  the parties would agree that any shortfall would be applied against amounts owed by an equity investee of the company to genesis under an million note given to genesis as part of the purchase price for interests in seven properties acquired from genesis in the proposed restructuring is subject to approval by the boards of the company  genesis and multicare and by each company s principal lenders 
no assurance can be given that the proposed restructuring will be completed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investments in real estate loans receivable bear interest at fixed rates 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying fixed interest rate loans receivable  but not earnings or cash flows 
based on the repayment terms and additional commitments of the loans receivable existing at december   a one percent increase in the interest rates would change the fair value of these loans receivable by approximately  the fair value of the company s real estate loans receivable at december  approximates its carrying value of million 
the company s bonds and most of the company s mortgages payable bear interest at fixed rates 
the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its credit facility and variable rate mortgages 
the company utilizes interest rate cap agreements to limit the impact that interest rate fluctuations have on its variable rate mortgages 
interest rate cap agreements are used for hedging purposes rather than for trading purposes 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or any other type of derivative financial instrument  other than interest rate cap agreements 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying indebtedness  but not earnings or cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
the maturity schedule for the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable is as follows in thousands thereafter  at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable approximates its carrying value of million 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
at december   the fair value of the company s variable rate debt approximates its carrying value of million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and variable rate mortgages was at december  assuming the credit facility and variable rate mortgage balances outstanding at december  of million remains constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates from at december  would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  based on the current interest rate terms 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at floating rates ranging from to over one month libor  as determined by the percentage of the credit facility outstanding as compared to the borrowing base 
variable rate mortgages bear interest at over one month libor 
the fair value of the company s interest rate cap agreements at december  approximates its carrying value of approximately  the company may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  therefore  would result in increases in interest expenses  which could adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay its obligations and make distributions to shareholders at current levels
