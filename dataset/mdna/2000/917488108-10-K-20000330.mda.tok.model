item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts and where noted 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
total utmd asset turns ratio of sales to total assets improved again in because sales increased while average total assets decreased from the prior year 
year ending total assets were lower because current assets declined as a result of significantly reducing levels of cash  inventory and receivables  net fixed assets declined as a result of depreciation which exceeded replacement  and net intangible assets declined because amortization of goodwill and intellectual property exceeded new acquisitions 
year end net intangible assets represent of total assets 
excluding the possibility of new intangible assets from acquisitions  total asset productivity should continue to improve in because sales are projected to grow while working capital remains about the same and net property plant and equipment pp e assets decline as depreciation exceeds the rate of new purchases 
net after accumulated depreciation pp e in utah and oregon decreased million  while in ireland decreased million 
consolidated pp e asset turns improved to based on year ending balances 
productivity of pp e in should continue to increase since sales are expected to increase  and net pp e decrease  as consolidated new capital expenditures are expected to be less than one half of depreciation 
inventory turns increased in due to higher sales together with lower inventory at year end 
lower inventory balances resulted from utmd using inventories previously obtained in its gesco acquisition and continuing to improve its mrp processes 
management expects to be able to achieve its objective of inventory turns in because sales should continue to increase without the need for a similar increase in inventories 
the year ending accounts receivable a r balances declined despite higher sales activity for the year 
calculated days in receivables improved to  based on q shipments activity 
aged a r over days from invoice date decreased to about of total accounts receivable at year end from at the end of the decrease in the older receivables balance is due mainly to resolving the delinquency of one distributor in the far east 
the working capital decline of million in was the result of the significant reduction in current assets coupled with a modest increase in current liabilities associated with higher business activity 
through its excellent profitability  utmd expects to internally finance any working capital growth that is needed to support growth in sales activity 
b liabilities 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio increased to of total assets from at the end of in addition to current liabilities associated with current production and sales activity  utmd has a few lease obligations see note  page f and an unsecured line of credit 
the balance of the revolving line of credit increased by million in because utmd used its financing facility to aggressively retire about of its outstanding shares at a total cost of million 
in  if no new significant acquisitions or repurchases of shares are made  the remaining revolving line of credit balance can be eliminated 
results of operations 
a revenues 
annual consolidated revenues were up in utmd divides its sales channels in the us into direct sales which are sales to end user customers through utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  and specialty distributors  and oem sales which are sales to other medical device companies where products are resold as part of a component of a kit or a repackaged stand alone product 
in  us direct sales represented of global consolidated sales compared to in and in in the us only  direct sales represented of sales compared to in and in as a percentage of total us sales  oem sales represented of sales  compared to in and in us oem sales excluding sales to baxter declined in foreign sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to in and in foreign sales of blood pressure monitoring bpm products were up relative to the prior year 
ob gyn and neonatal product sales were of foreign sales  compared to in and in foreign sales of ob gyn and neonatal products increased  and totaled million for ireland operations shipped of foreign sales in  compared to in and in utmd divides its sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for improving clinician safety and for ease in performing delivery procedures  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological office clinician practices  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal  comprised of devices for gaining vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  and other specialized tools used in the care of critically ill infants  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized tools for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  along with products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors generally enjoy a dominant market share and typically have important product features protected by patents 
sales in the obstetrics product category decreased in and represented of total sales 
obstetrics sales were  in  compared to  in and  in direct sales of the market leading iup catheter  intran plus  declined under active competition from cheaper  less clinically effective products 
sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads decreased in  due apparently to a decline in utilization by us hospitals 
utmd believes that using vads remains the trained physician s best choice in most operative deliveries  and will increase educational programs in gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales grew in  and represented of total revenues 
gyn es uro sales were  in  compared to  in and  in several products contributed to sales growth  including epitome  liberty  pathfinder  and c letz contoured electrodes 
utmd looks to continue to develop and market specialized electrosurgical electrodes and other urological devices in marketing this group of products requires multiple sales call points and extensive clinical training and familiarization time with users  among other challenges  resulting in continued low adoption growth rates 
neonatal sales include the neonatal product line of gesco international acquired in july compared to  utmd s neonatal product sales grew 
neonatal product sales were  in  compared to  in and in utmd expects the neonatal product line to continue to be a significant contributor to its growth in bpm and accessories sales represented of consolidated sales  the same portion as the prior year 
sales of bpm products in were  compared to  in and  in although a mature product line  utmd continues to enjoy a stable and significant demand for its well regarded bpm products  particularly overseas 
b gross profits 
the average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus remaining after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from net revenues  in was compared to in and in gross margins improved successively each quarter in  led by product design improvements  better materials management and better utilization of overhead costs 
looking forward to  offsetting influences are expected to result in gpm of about 
expected favorable influences include continued growth in sales volume without a similar increase in overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products to reduce costs 
unfavorable influences are expected to be continued competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates for employees 
utmd management believes that consistently achieving an average gpm above is necessary to successfully support the significant sales and marketing  research and development  and administrative expenses associated with a growth company in a highly complex and competitive marketplace 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus remaining after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative expenses sg a and research and development expenses r d 
utmd further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing expenses s m and general and administrative expenses g a 
despite only a increase in total sales  operating profits increased to  from  in  and  in total operating expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in  and in  demonstrating the operating leverage achievable when sales continue to grow 
sg a expenses in decreased to of revenues from of revenues  although in dollar terms sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the g a expenses portion increased to million in from million in  due to increased expenses from amortization of goodwill gwa associated with the mid gesco acquisition 
gwa in was compared to in  and in looking forward  gwa in will also be  without additional acquisitions in since the result of the acquisitions were additional new marketable products for utmd  the gwa expenses can be regarded as surrogate r d expenses captured in g a 
s m expenses are the costs of promoting  selling and providing customer support of utmd s products 
although sales and gpms improve when sales are made through directly employed sales representatives in lieu of independent distributors or oem customers  s m operating expenses increase as an offset 
global sales in increased while s m expenses declined  improving the productivity of s m resources 
the majority of utmd s s m expenses pertain to the us direct sales portion of its business 
in  utmd s s m expenses to sales ratio is expected to remain consistent with the previous year 
at the end of  utmd terminated an exclusive third party distributor relationship for the states of hawaii and alaska  representing of domestic direct sales 
r d expenses in were of sales compared to of sales in  and in the mid year termination of internal efforts committed to utmd s novel fetal ph monitoring project was responsible for the decline in spending 
other projects included the continuing development of the fowler endocurette  enhancements to the gesco neonatal product line  and improvements to utmd s established products 
the improvements in materials and configuration of components was evident in utmd s improved gpms 
at utmd r d resources are kept involved in the support of manufacturing processes  as utmd finds it makes long term sense to keep its most technical people involved with products throughout their life cycles 
in  utmd s r d expenses to sales ratio is expected to remain consistent with d non operating income 
non operating income includes primarily royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  but also interest and capital gains from investing the company s cash offset by interest expenses and bank fees on the revolving line of credit  and gains or losses from the sale of assets 
non operating income in was  compared to in and  in there were unusual payments received in and for the use of utmd s pressure monitoring technology  which are subject to a confidentiality agreement  which were nonrecurring in royalties received in were less than in the prior year 
in  there was also a one time gain from the sale of a small real estate property no longer used by the company 
interest expenses and bank fees associated with the line of credit were in  in and in assuming no change in current interest rates and no new borrowing to finance an extraordinary capital requirement  net non operating income is expected to be about royalties received vary from period to period depending on the desire and or success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the patents 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt  as a percentage of sales  was compared to and in and  respectively 
these profit margins are extremely high when compared with utmd s peers in the medical device industry  or other industries 
the resulting profit dollars are equivalent to profits generated by well performing companies with twice or more the sales of utmd 
ebt in were up relative to even though sales were up only and non operating income was down  because operating income in increased 
utmd expects that it can continue its excellent overall profit performance in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for  and  respectively 
net income in was up 
after income taxes  net income was  compared to  in and  in the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  differing balances in tax exempt investments  amount of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profitability of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on manufactured products  changes in the amount of non deductible goodwill expense resulting from an acquisition  and other factors such as r d tax credits and actual litigation costs versus accrued expenses 
the amortization of goodwill associated with the columbia medical  inc acquisition is not tax deductible 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the current market value 
diluted eps were up to 
compared to 
in  and 
in ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  future eps can be increased by investing current net income to increase future net profits through expanded product offerings and profitable business operations  or by repurchasing stock  thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares 
utmd believes that shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its growth  divided by average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues 
in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
roe in was  and has averaged for the last thirteen years 
cash flows and capital resources 
a cash flows 
ebitda ebt  adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  asset dispositions  and interest expense and bank fees associated with the line of credit is a good measure of utmd s ability to generate cash 
ebitda was million  or as a ratio of sales  
ebitda has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of excellent operating earnings  a substantial non cash charge to earnings from amortization of goodwill and receipt of payments for the use of utmd s technology 
because of ebitda performance in  utmd was able to purchase million in new property and equipment to maintain its facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order and repurchase million worth or about of its shares  while only increasing its bank revolving line of credit balance by million 
cash and equivalent balances were million at the end of utmd effectively maintains zero balance sweep cash account balances that minimize the line of credit balance  except for amounts held to meet operating requirements in ireland and separate physical reserves set aside for litigation expenses and other contractual commitments where cash has been committed 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in financing activities in provided additional cash of  through the bank line of credit 
a total of  shares of stock were repurchased at an average cost  including commissions  of share  using  in cash 
utmd received in cash from the sale of  shares of stock through employee option exercises at an average price of per share 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans 
planned capital expenditures  expected to be consistent in magnitude with  will keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to the capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases when the price of the stock remains extremely undervalued  and  if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
utmd plans to use any cash not needed for the above pursuits during the remainder of to reduce the line of credit balance 
however  the revolving credit line will continue to be used for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time 
management s outlook 
internally generated cash flow directly impacts shareholder value to the extent it can be used to accelerate growth in the business  fund attractive acquisitions  or be returned to investors through dividends or share repurchases 
therefore  most financial analysts agree that a company s value is not based on historical sales or earnings but rather the certainty of its future cash flow 
history should be interesting to investors where it can provide insight into what might happen in the future 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high cash flow performance by achieving ebitda in excess of of sales 
in and  ebitda was and of sales  respectively 
over the last three year period  utmd s cash flow funded three significant achievements a net after option exercises repurchase of million of its shares at an average cost of per share including commissions and other repurchase costs  two significant acquisitions costing million which accounted for of total sales in  and r d spending of million or about of sales 
in  management expects to be able to extend utmd s excellent ebitda performance for another year 
in a competitive marketplace  utmd has built and continued to successfully defend a dominant market franchise in the most special areas of hospitals caring for mothers and their babies  with innovative and highly effective products 
utmd s direct us sales team continues to evolve into a key resource for achieving utmd s objectives to help clarify clinician needs  responsively provide excellent solutions for those needs  and assure timely support for clinical customers use of utmd s solutions 
to be successful in its programs  utmd must provide clinicians with the information they need to make important judgments about using certain products in obtaining optimal clinical outcomes  which include minimizing risk of complications 
utmd must also be able to provide support for physicians to explain those needs to hospital administrators who are primarily focused on reducing current operating costs 
where utmd has a proprietary advantage  it must actively defend its patents from infringers and continue to develop new products representing a quantum improvement in care 
utmd remains encouraged that the federal judicial process will allow a favorable resolution of its two ongoing intran iupc patent infringement lawsuits 
the substantial legal costs of the litigation continue to be absorbed in g a expenses 
the company s gynecology practice tools are intended to leverage utmd s reputation with physicians outside the hospital 
the niche markets for which utmd s gynecology urology electrosurgery products are targeted have proven to require many and varied marketing initiatives 
they require individual user training together with evidence of improved outcomes 
sales of newer products are growing slowly and consistently 
utmd will continue to patiently investigate economic ways to increase the rate of adoption of its newer products 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and actively recruit needed new business partners 
in  utmd expects its ireland subsidiary  which shipped of all foreign sales in  to continue its important contribution to overall performance 
in  utmd implemented a yk plan to identify and solve potential yk problems 
utmd experienced no material adverse consequences from the year yk problem  having taken all appropriate actions to be prepared 
the costs associated with the efforts were absorbed in and earlier results 
the company has determined that all of the products it sells are yk compliant 
none of utmd s products use or process dates in any form 
utmd s ending share price of was times earnings per share eps of  which were up 
in other words  utmd s year end price to earnings ratio per was the trailing twelve months ttm eps growth rate is more than three times the year end per expressed as a percent 
as a value indicator  the ratio of return on average shareholder equity roe to per equals times  the highest in utmd s history 
for reference  the end of roe per ratio was equal times and ttm eps growth rate of in was less than one times the year ending per 
utmd s ending share price was times eps of 
these ratio comparisons suggest that from either a growth or a value perspective  um s stock may represent an uncommon buy opportunity 
accounting policy changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
sfas is now effective for fiscal years beginning after june  utmd believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company
