this affected the overall demand for natural rubber as speculators in the futures market purchased a substantial quantity of natural rubber to hedge their exposure in the futures market in the past 
the increase in selling price was mainly due to the stabilization of most asian currencies in therefore  the domestic natural rubber has become more competitive compared to imported natural rubber in terms of selling price including vat and import tariff 
sale procurement of materials and supplies and distribution of other agricultural products net sales decreased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us million in from rmb million us million in the decrease was mainly due to sales of barley that amounted to rmb million us million in  which was a one off transaction 
as this product was unprofitable  management decided to suspend the trading of this product 
on the other hand  there was a sales contribution from the supermarket operation that was commenced during the fourth quarter of  amounting to rmb  us 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profit decreased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us million in from rmb million us million in the gross profit margin decreased from in to in the reason for the decline in gross profit margin was due to the fact that the company was previously guaranteed a minimum gross profit margin of on natural rubber purchased from the hainan state farms by the farming bureau  the guarantee was subsequently changed to in view of the prevailing market conditions pursuant to an agreement effective as of april  loss on impairment of an investment for the year ended december   the company wrote down  in aggregate  rmb million us million against a long term investment and an investment purchase deposit in a prc listed company  due to an adverse change in the business environment in the prc

in addition  part of the cash and cash equivalent was deposited to two securities companies in the prc in  which offered a better interest rate than that of other financial institutions 
other income  net other income increased by rmb million us  or to rmb million us million in from rmb million us  in other income in represented the recovery of a margin deposit paid to a future broker of rmb million us  which was provided for in  dividend income from the company s long term investment that amounted to rmb million us  and a net gain on trading of marketable securities

year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales distribution of natural rubber net sales decreased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us million  compared to rmb  million us million for the corresponding period in the decrease in natural rubber sales was due to the decrease in average natural rubber price from approximately rmb  us  per ton in to approximately rmb  us per ton in  and the decrease in sales quantity in as compared with the corresponding period in the decreases in rubber price and unit sales were due to the keen competition from overseas suppliers  the currency deflation of most rubber producing countries such as thailand  indonesia and malaysia  and an overall decrease in domestic demand 
the gradual decrease in prc import tariff made imported rubber more attractive to domestic customers due to a decrease in price difference between domestic and imported rubber 
in addition  in order to foster the growth of certain state owned enterprises involved in the manufacturing of rubber related products  the prc government granted various tariff exemptions to them 
together with the favorable credit terms provided by overseas suppliers  many customers switched to imported rubber  which caused a significant decrease in domestic demand of natural rubber 
sales procurement of materials and supplies and distribution of other agricultural products net sales increased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us million  compared to rmb million us million for the corresponding period in the increase of net sales from procurement of materials and supplies was mainly due to the sales of barley that amounted to rmb million us million during this was a one off transaction  as this product was not profitable and management decided to suspend the trading of this product 
however  this increase was partly offset by the reduction of sales of production materials due to intense competition from other suppliers located in proximity to various rubber farms  and to the sluggish consumption market 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profits decreased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us million in from rmb million us million in the gross profit margin also decreased from in to in the decrease was mainly due to a lower gross profit margin achieved by the company related to sales of rubber inventory which was purchased at much higher cost in prior years 
in addition  there was a gross loss arose from the sale of barley that amounted to rmb million us  during loss on impairment of an investment for the year ended december   the company wrote down  in aggregate  rmb million us million against a long term investment and an investment purchase deposit in a prc listed company  due to an adverse change in the business environment in the prc 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by rmb million us  or to rmb million us million in from rmb million us million in the increase was primarily due to the write off of margin deposits paid to two futures brokers after the closure of ccfe in hainan in late financial income  net the increase in net financial income from rmb  us  in to rmb million us  in was mainly due to an increase in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents after the withdrawal of futures margin deposits  and there was an interest expense of rmb million us  in on a temporary advance for the acquisition of a long term investment 
other income  net other income decreased by rmb million us million or to rmb million us  in from rmb million us million in this significant decrease was primarily due to the decrease in gains on trading of rubber futures contracts for non hedging purposes 
the company ceased the trading of rubber futures contracts during the second quarter of as a result of the increased volatility of the futures market and the reduction of natural rubber demand in the open market 
liquidity and capital resources the company s and its subsidiaries primary liquidity needs are to fund accounts receivable  inventories and  to a lesser extent  to expand business operations 
the company has financed its working capital requirements through the internally generated cashflows 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was rmb million  rmb million and rmb million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash flows from the company s operating activities are attributable to the company s income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the farming bureau has guaranteed the recoverability of current accounts receivable from the hainan state farms and other related companies controlled and owned by the farming bureau 
pursuant to an assets and staff transfer agreement dated march   the farming bureau purchased assets and assumed liabilities and staff related to the ceased businesses effective as of january  the purchase price was the book value or fair value of the net assets transferred which was not differ materially from the book value  determined as of january   whichever was the lower 
the company believes that the internally generated funds will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated working capital needs for at least the next months 
inflation the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected by economic and changes in the policies of the prc government  such as changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof  measures which may be introduced to regulate or stimulate the rate of economic growth 
the rate of deflation of the prc economy  based on published consumer price information  was percent for and percent for the months ended october  the prc government has taken certain measures to stimulate domestic demand and consumption 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
market risk and risk management policies all of the company s sales and purchases are made domestically and are denominated in renminbi 
accordingly  the company and its subsidiaries do not have material market risk with respect to currency fluctuation 
as the reporting currency of the company s consolidated financial statements is also renminbi  there is no significant translation difference arising on consolidation 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of renminbi interest rates 
in this regard  changes in renminbi interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents 
as at december   the company s cash equivalents are mainly renminbi  hong kong dollar and united states dollar deposits with financial institutions  bearing market interest rates without fixed term 
the company s board of directors adopted a risk management resolution authorizing the management to enter natural rubber commodities futures contracts for hedging the price risk associated with certain firm commitments for the purchase of natural rubber 
the company also traded natural rubber commodity futures contracts which were not specific hedges 
as at december   the company had neither a position in natural rubber commodity futures contracts  nor firm commitments for the purchase of natural rubber 
as at december   the company had short term investments in marketable securities mainly in the prc stock market that amounted to rmb million us million 
these investments expose the company to market risks that may cause the future value of these investments to be lower than the original cost of such investments at the time of purchase 
year issue the year issue is the result of information technology systems and embedded systems using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
the company and its subsidiaries use a limited amount of computer software primarily in connection with their accounting and financial reporting systems 
such programs have been upgraded so that they are year compatible 
in addition to software issues  certain of the computer hardware of the company and its subsidiaries have been replaced with more current technology
