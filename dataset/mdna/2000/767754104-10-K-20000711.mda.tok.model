item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended february  and february  presented below reflects certain restatements to rite aid s previously reported results of operations for these periods 
see business restatement of historical financial statements and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these restatements 
overview management believes that the following matters should be considered in connection with the discussion of results of operations and financial condition 
maturing store base 
since the beginning of fiscal  rite aid has built new stores  relocated stores and closed stores 
these new and relocated stores represent approximately of rite aid s total stores at june  the new and relocated stores opened in recent years are generally larger  free standing stores with higher operating expenses than our older stores 
new stores generally do not become profitable until a critical mass of customers is developed 
relocated stores also must attract additional customers to achieve comparable profitability to the store that was replaced 
we believe that the period of time required for a new store to achieve profitable operations is generally between two to four years 
this period can vary significantly based on the location of a particular store and on other factors  including the investments made in purchasing prescription files for the location and advertising 
our recent liquidity constraints have limited our ability to purchase prescription files and make other investments to promote the development of our new and relocated stores 
we believe that our relatively high percentage of new and relocated stores is a significant factor in our recent operating results 
as new management continues to implement its long term strategy  it will scale back rite aid s new store construction program and focus on making the operations of its existing base of new and relocated stores profitable 
management believes that as these newer stores mature they should gain the critical mass of customers needed for profitable operations 
this continuing maturation should positively affect rite aid s operating performance in future periods 
if we are not able to improve the performance of these new and relocated stores it will adversely affect our ability to restore the profitability of our operations 
reclassification of lease obligations 
in connection with the restatement of rite aid s operating results for fiscal and  certain store leases that had previously been classified as operating leases have now been classified as capital leases 
as a result of this restatement  our property  plant and equipment and total debt balances at february  were increased by million and  million  respectively 
the change in classification of these lease obligations will result in an allocation of depreciation charges to cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense 
in addition  a portion of the lease payments will be included in interest expense 
substantial investigation expenses 
the company has incurred substantial costs in connection with the process of reviewing  reconciling and restating its books and records  the investigation of its prior accounting practices and the preparation of its audited financial statements 
included in these expenses are the costs of the deloitte touche llp audit  the investigation by swidler berlin  assisted by deloitte touche llp and the costs of retaining arthur andersen llp to assist management in reviewing and reconciling its books and records 
management currently estimates that these costs will total approximately million  of which million was incurred in fiscal  million was incurred in first fiscal quarter of fiscal  and the balance is expected to be incurred in the second quarter of fiscal and thereafter 
rite aid anticipates that it will continue to incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with the ongoing litigation and investigations to which it is subject 
possible sale of pcs 
we have had discussions with several parties and are currently negotiating seriously with one interested party concerning a sale of pcs 
at the date of this filing no agreement has been reached 
no assurance can be given that an agreement will be reached or that  if it is  that any sale will be consummated 
if no sale transaction is available on terms we consider acceptable  we intend to continue to own and operate pcs 
based on current negotiations  it is likely that rite aid would recognize a significant loss upon the commitment to sell 
in addition  the sale of pcs will result in a loss of significant tax benefits 
dilutive equity issuances 
in june  rite aid completed a series of debt restructuring transactions as described further below under liquidity and capital resources 
in connection with these transactions an aggregate total of  shares of rite aid s common stock were issued in exchange for million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  pursuant to the conversion price adjustment and pay in kind dividend provisions of the convertible preferred stock issued to an affiliate of leonard green and partners  lp in october   shares of rite aid common stock were issuable upon the conversion of such preferred stock at june  giving pro forma effect to these issuances and adjustments  the basic and fully diluted average shares outstanding at february  would have increased from  to  in light of our substantial leverage and liquidity constraints  we will continue to consider opportunities to use the company s equity securities to discharge debt or other obligations that may arise 
such issuances may have a dilutive effect on the outstanding shares of rite aid common stock 
accounting systems 
following its review of the company s books and records  management concluded that further steps were needed to establish and maintain the adequacy of its internal accounting systems and controls 
in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements  deloitte touche llp advised rite aid that it believed there were numerous reportable conditions under the standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants which relate to the company s accounting systems and controls and could adversely affect the company s ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements 
management s long term strategy includes a comprehensive plan to develop  implement and maintain adequate and reliable accounting systems and controls which address the reportable conditions identified by deloitte touche llp 
results of operations consolidated revenues fy fy fy dollars in thousands sales    sales growth retail drug segment    pbm segment   store data total stores beginning of period    new stores closed stores store acquisitions  net relocated stores remodeled stores total stores end of period    see selected financial data for a discussion of rite aid s inability to present comparisons to fiscal pcs was acquired on january  the acquisition of pcs on january  was the primary contributor to the growth in our consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in consolidated sales in fiscal benefitted from full year sales of million from the harco  inc harco and k b  inc 
k b stores which contributed only million of sales in fiscal following their acquisition on august  because pcs was acquired late in fiscal  there is insufficient operating data for prior periods to present a meaningful comparison to its operations in fiscal pcs derived of its total revenues in fiscal from mail order programs 
revenues from manufacturer programs and claims processing contributed and  respectively  of total pcs revenues in fiscal retail drug segment fy fy fy sales thousands    sales growth same store sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy as a of total segment sales third party sales as a of total pharmacy sales front end sales growth same store front end sales growth front end as a of total segment sales see selected financial data for a discussion of rite aid s inability to present comparisons to fiscal the growth in retail drug segment sales in fiscal was primarily due to the continuing strong growth of our pharmacy sales  which more than offset a decline in our front end sales 
our retail drug revenues in fiscal grew over the level in fiscal as a result of strong growth in pharmacy revenues and a slight increase in front end sales 
for fiscal and fiscal  pharmacy revenues led sales growth with same store sales increases of and  respectively 
our pharmacy sales growth continued to benefit from our ability to attract and retain managed care customers  our ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies and favorable industry trends 
these trends include an aging american population with many baby boomers  now in their fifties  consuming a greater number of prescription drugs 
the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs also contribute to the growing demand for pharmaceutical products 
front end sales  which include all non prescription sales  such as seasonal merchandise  convenience items and food and other non prescription sales  decreased in fiscal from the prior year 
our front end sales were adversely affected by our elevated levels of out of stock merchandise in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal other factors adversely affecting our front end sales included the suspension by former management of our newspaper advertising circular program and their decision to raise front end prices to levels that were not competitive 
fiscal front end sales increased over fiscal  despite a increase in same store front end sales in those stores which had been open more than one year 
same store sales growth was driven by strong performance in health and beauty  photo  seasonal and general merchandise categories 
total front end sales remained essentially flat as an increase in the number of closed stores and a decrease in the number of acquired stores in fiscal resulted in a net reduction of stores in operation at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses fy fy fy costs of goods sold    gross margin selling  general and administrative    selling  general and administrative as a of revenues gain on sale of stores   goodwill amortization    interest expense    closed store  impairment and other charges    cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins in fiscal declined from the prior year as a result of the acquisition of pcs  which operates with lower margins than the retail drug segment  and the continuing increase in third party pharmacy sales as a percentage of total retail drug segment sales 
gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to the incurrence of substantial additional costs related to our distribution facilities and increased store occupancy costs 
we incurred significant start up costs in fiscal in connection with the new distribution facility located in perryman  maryland and also in connection with the processing of merchandise received from our stores for shipment back to our vendors 
these increased costs were partially offset by a substantial credit to cost of goods sold resulting from the receipt of vendor allowances following a restructuring of the terms of certain vendor contracts 
in fiscal  prior to the restructuring of the contracts  these vendor allowances were credited to selling  general and administrative expense 
also partially offsetting the increases in cost of goods sold in fiscal were improved store level margins for front end and pharmacy sales 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was a result of a substantial decline in our pharmacy margins 
a decline in occupancy costs in fiscal was largely offset by increased costs related to our distribution facilities 
also  negatively impacting gross margins in the periods presented was the continuing industry trend of rising third party sales coupled with decreasing margins on third party reimbursed prescription sales 
third party prescription sales typically have lower gross margins than other prescription sales because they are paid by a person or entity other than the recipient of the prescribed pharmaceutical and are generally subject to lower negotiated reimbursement rates in conjunction with a pharmacy benefit plan 
pharmacy sales as a percentage of total segment sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the ratios of third party sales to total pharmacy sales were  and for fiscal  and  respectively  as the percentage of third party sales continued to grow in each period 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the effective lifo inflation rates were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal which resulted in charges to cost of goods sold of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has changed its method of accounting for lifo as of february  see accounting change 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense sg a was of sales in fiscal  of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in vendor allowances following the restructuring of certain vendor contracts as described above  increased accruals for litigation and other contingencies and a significant increase in legal and other professional fees 
these more than offset the effects of the acquisition of pcs  which operates with a substantially lower sg a margin than the retail drug segment 
goodwill amortization goodwill amortization increased during fiscal over the level recorded in fiscal due to the additional goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of pcs in january the increased fiscal amortization expense attributable to pcs more than offset a slight reduction in amortization expense for the company s prior acquisitions 
goodwill amortization expense increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions of pcs in january  and harco and k b in fiscal goodwill amortization expense in fiscal included one month of expense associated with pcs and a full year s amortization of the goodwill recorded in connection with the harco and k b acquisitions 
only weeks of goodwill amortization for harco and k b was recorded in fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the substantial increase in interest expense in fiscal is due to higher levels of indebtedness throughout the year 
the level of the company s indebtedness increased in fiscal primarily as a result of a full year s interest expense on the billion borrowed in january under the pcs credit facility and the million of demand note borrowings incurred in june to supplement cash flows from operating activities and to fund capital expenditures 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively 
closed store  impairment and other charges during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded pre tax charges of million  million and million  for the closing of  and stores  respectively 
store closings  impairments and other charges consist of for the for the for the year ended year ended year ended february  february  february  store lease exit costs 
   impairment charges    these charges are related entirely to operations in the retail drug business segment 
income taxes the company had a net loss in fiscal in addition  as a result of the restatements of fiscal and  rite aid had net losses in fiscal and fiscal tax benefits of million  million and million have been reflected for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the full benefit of the net operating losses nols generated in each period has been partially offset by a valuation allowance based on management s determination that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company expects to file amended tax returns and utilize the nol s against taxable income in prior years to the maximum extent possible 
approximately million is currently expected to be recovered through carryback claims 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has two primary sources of liquidity cash provided by operations and the revolving credit facility under our new senior secured credit facility 
we may also generate liquidity from the sale of assets  including sale leaseback transactions 
during fiscal and the fiscal quarter ended may   cash provided by operations was not sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  which have included the substantial accounting and legal costs incurred in connection with the review and reconciliation of our books and records  the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal  fiscal and the audit of our financial statements for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as a result  we have supplemented our cash from operations with borrowings under our credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  service our obligations to pay interest and principal on our debt  and to provide funds for capital expenditures 
credit facilities and debt restructuring in june  we completed a major financial restructuring that extended the maturity dates of a substantial amount of our debt until at least august and converted a portion of our debt to equity 
these refinancing transactions are described below 
new senior secured credit facility 
we entered into a new billion syndicated senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by citibank na  as agent 
the new facility matures on august   and consists of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
we used the term facility to terminate our accounts receivable securitization facility and repurchase million of unpaid receivables thereunder  to fund million of transaction costs relating to our financial restructuring and to provide million of cash that will be available for general corporate purposes 
the revolving facility provides us with borrowings for working capital requirements  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facilities generally bear interest either at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at plus citibank s base rate 
for additional information about the interest rates applicable to our credit facilities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks below 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the commitment 
substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
these subsidiary guarantees are secured by a first priority lien on the inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and some of the real estate assets of the subsidiary guarantors 
our direct obligations under the senior credit facility are unsecured 
the senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants  which place restrictions on the assumption of debt  the payment of dividends  mergers  liens and sale and leaseback transactions 
the facility requires us to meet various financial ratios and limits our capital expenditures 
these ratios and capital expenditure limits are subject to adjustment if we sell pcs 
these covenants require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 

if pcs is sold for the quarter ended august   increasing to if pcs is sold for the four quarter period ending june   and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 

if pcs is sold for the quarter ended august   increasing to if pcs is sold for the four quarter period ending june  we also must maintain consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior secured credit facility of no less than million million if pcs is sold for the quarter ended august   increasing to million million if pcs is sold for the four quarter period ending june  in addition  our capital expenditures are limited to million million if pcs is sold for the fiscal quarter ended august   increasing to million million if pcs is sold for the four quarter period ending june  the facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of rite aid debt to accelerate the maturity of debt equaling million or more 
our ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is based on a specified borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
at june   the million term loan was fully drawn 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility at june   however  million of the availability was being utilized to support trade letters of credit 
other existing facilities 
we extended to august the maturity date of our existing syndicated credit facilities  which consist of the rcf credit facility and the pcs credit facility 
borrowings under the pcs credit facility bear interest at libor plus and borrowings under the rcf credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
the interest rate on our borrowings under these facilities will increase by per annum if we have not received  and applied to reduce principal  at least million of net proceeds from asset sales prior to november  these credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which place restrictions on the assumption of debt  the payment of dividends  mergers  liens and sale leaseback transactions 
these credit facilities also require us to satisfy financial covenants which are generally slightly less restrictive than the covenants in the new senior secured credit facility 
the facilities also limit the amount of our capital expenditures to million for the quarter ended august   increasing to million for the four quarters ending june  any net proceeds realized from a sale of pcs must be applied first to reduce the outstanding balances of the pcs credit facility and then to reduce the then outstanding balance of the rcf credit facility 
the amounts repaid with the proceeds of asset sales may not be reborrowed 
the pcs credit facility continues to be secured by a first lien on the stock of pcs and the rcf credit facility continues to be secured by a first lien on the stock of drugstore 
com and a second lien on the stock of pcs 
at june  we had billion of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities 
these facilities are also guaranteed and secured as described below 
exchange offers 
in june  we completed the exchange of million of our notes due and million of our notes due for an aggregate of million of our new senior secured notes due after the exchange  million of the notes due and million of the notes due remained outstanding 
in connection with the exchange  we entered into a forward purchase agreement to sell million of our senior secured notes due to certain banks 
the proceeds from such sale will permit us to repay approximately million of the notes due when they mature in december of this year 
the remaining notes due in december and notes due will be retired with rite aid s general corporate funds 
exchange of debt for equity and exchange debt 
as part of our restructuring  certain affiliates of jp morgan  which had lent us million under a demand note in june and was also a lender under the rcf and pcs credit facilities  together with certain other lenders under the two credit facilities  agreed to exchange a portion of their loans for a new secured exchange debt obligation and common stock 
this resulted in a total of million of debt under these facilities  including million of the outstanding principal of the demand note  being exchanged for common stock at a price of per share 
an additional million of borrowings under the facilities were exchanged for the exchange debt  including the entire remaining principal amount of the jp morgan demand note 
the terms of the exchange debt are substantially the same as the terms of our rcf and pcs credit facilities and the interest rate is currently libor plus 
the lenders of the exchange debt have the same collateral as they did with respect to their loans under the credit facilities or demand note  as applicable  and also received a first lien on our prescription files 
in addition  on june   we issued million shares of our common stock in exchange for million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due synthetic leases 
as part of our restructuring  we amended our existing guarantees of two synthetic lease transactions to provide substantially the same terms as the terms of our rcf and pcs credit facilities 
second priority collateral 
in connection with modifications to the existing syndicated credit facilities  the exchange for exchange debt and the guarantees of the synthetic lease transactions  substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guaranteed our obligations thereunder on a second priority basis 
these subsidiary guarantees are secured by a second priority lien on the inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and some of the real estate assets of the subsidiary guarantors 
except to the extent previously secured  our direct obligations under those facilities and guarantees remain unsecured 
commercial paper 
until september   the company issued commercial paper supported by unused credit commitments to supplement cash generated by operations 
since the loss of our investment grade rating in fiscal  we are no longer able to issue commercial paper 
outstanding commercial paper of the company amounted to million at february    million at february  and million at february  during fiscal  the reduction of commercial paper was achieved through borrowings on our lines of credit 
all remaining commercial paper obligations were repaid in march the increase in commercial paper in was due to the acquisition of pcs in january  which accounted for approximately billion of the total outstanding commercial paper at the end of fiscal offsetting the increase were net proceeds received from the issuance of million in long term debt in december and net proceeds from the issuance of million dealer remarketable securities in september reductions in commercial paper during were achieved through the issuance of million of our convertible subordinated notes in the third quarter of fiscal debt capitalization 
the following table sets forth our debt capitalization in millions at june   following the completion of the restructuring transactions described above as of june  secured debt senior facility pcs facility  rcf facility senior secured notes due exchange debt prudential note other lease financing obligations  other senior debt notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due drs sm due senior debentures due notes due debentures due subordinated debt convertible subordinated notes due total debt  proceeds from the term loan portion of the senior facility were used to repay the million outstanding balance of our receivables securitization facility  to pay approximately million of expenses in connection with the refinancing transactions and to provide million of incremental cash on our balance sheet 
no borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the senior facility were outstanding at june   however  million of availability was being utilized to support trade letters of credit 
the receivables securitization facility was an off balance sheet liability and therefore was not included in the company s balance sheet in prior periods 
outstanding amount of senior secured notes due at june  does not include million of such notes which are held by a special purpose subsidiary of the company and are subject to a forward purchase commitment by certain financial institutions 
the proceeds from the sale of these notes will be used to retire an equivalent amount of the remaining notes due upon their maturity in december the remaining notes due will be retired with the company s general corporate funds 
outstanding principal amount was reduced to million with the exchange offer for common stock consummated on june   pursuant to which million principal amount of these notes were exchanged for common stock 
net cash provided by operations the company used million of cash to fund operations in fiscal operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cashflow benefited from an increase in other liabilities partially offset by an increase in current assets 
in fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations 
operating cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable  which was mostly offset by a corresponding decline in inventory 
fiscal operating cash flow of million benefited from a million reduction of accounts receivable 
this reduction resulted from the sale of accounts receivable through our accounts receivable securitization program 
operating cash flows benefited from the utilization of accounts payable to substantially finance the increase in inventories 
cash used for investing activities was million   million and  million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash used for store construction and relocations amounted to million for fiscal   million for fiscal and for fiscal in addition  cash of  million was used to acquire pcs in the prior fiscal year and million was used to acquire k b and harco in fiscal cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal   million for fiscal and million for fiscal increased bank borrowings  which replaced our commercial paper program and the sale of million of preferred stock were the main financing activities during fiscal in fiscal  the company signed commercial paper to finance the acquisition of pcs 
also during fiscal net proceeds were received from the issuance of million in long term debt and million of dealer unmarketable securities 
through the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in fiscal  reductions in outstanding commercial paper were made 
supplemental cash provided by financing activities were proceeds received from store sale and leaseback transactions of million  million and million for fiscal year  and  respectively 
capital expenditures rite aid plans to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal such expenditures consist of approximately million related to new store construction  store relocation and other store construction projects 
an additional million will be dedicated to other store improvement activities including the purchase of script pro machines and the purchase of script files from independent pharmacists 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
we are highly leveraged 
based upon current levels of operations and expected improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility and its other sources of liquidity including asset sales will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures until august  when billion of our indebtedness matures  including the revolving credit facility under the new senior secured credit facility 
our ability to replace  refinance or otherwise extend these obligations will depend in part on our ability to successfully execute our long term strategy and improve the operating performance of our stores 
for a discussion of factors that could affect our current assessment  see factors affecting our future prospects below 
accounting change in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our application of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting by restructuring our lifo pool structure through a combination of certain geographic pools 
the reduction in the number of lifo pools was made to more closely align the lifo pool structure to store merchandise categories 
the effect of this change in fiscal was to decrease our earnings by million net of tax effect of million  or 
per diluted common share 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was a charge of million net of tax effect of million  or 
per diluted common share 
the pro forma effect of this accounting change would have been a reduction in net income of million  net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share  and million net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share  for fiscal and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the sec issued staff accounting bulliten sab  revenue recognition 
this bulletin sets forth the sec staff s position regarding the point at which it is appropriate for a registrant to recognize revenue 
the staff believes that revenue is realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses the above criteria to determine whether revenue can be recognized  and therefore believes that the issuance of sab does not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement  which establishes the accounting and financial reporting requirements for derivative instruments  requires companies to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
in may  the fasb delayed the implementation date for this statement by one year 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
in the company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of sfas may have on consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness may severely limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely effect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
as of june   rite aid had billion of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and billion of capital leases including current maturities but excluding letters of credit and million of stockholders equity 
as of the same date we had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the debt restructuring transactions completed in june  our earnings would have been insufficient to cover our fixed charges for the year ended february   by billion 
our earnings for fiscal included non cash charges of million 
based on the indebtedness outstanding  at june  and then current interest rates our annualized interest expense would be approximately million 
our high level of indebtedness will have consequences on our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will 
limit our ability to obtain additional financing  
limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  
place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  
render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and 
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
a substantial portion of our indebtedness matures in august and september  our ability to refinance this indebtedness will be substantially dependent on our ability to improve our operating performance 
approximately billion of our indebtedness at june  will mature in august and september in order to satisfy these maturing obligations  we will need to refinance the obligations  sell assets to satisfy them or seek postponement of the maturity dates from our existing lenders 
our ability to successfully accomplish any of these alternative transactions will be substantially dependent on the successful execution of our long term strategic plan and the resulting improvements in our operating performance 
the interest rate on certain of our outstanding indebtedness is based upon floating interest rates 
if interest rates increase  our interest payment obligations will increase 
approximately billion of our outstanding indebtedness as of june  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior secured facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on this outstanding debt also increases 
an increase in libor therefore would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to incur liens and debt  pay dividends  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make loans  investments and capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers  consolidations  asset dispositions  sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  make distributions from subsidiaries and grant negative pledges to other creditors 
moreover  if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach of any of these covenants  then a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if such acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
risks related to our operations major lawsuits have been brought against us and certain of our subsidiaries  and there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the us securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney s office 
any criminal conviction against the company may result in the loss of licenses that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the sec and the united states attorney concerning our financial reporting and other matters 
an investigation has also been commenced by the department of labor concerning our employee benefit plans 
these investigations are ongoing and we cannot predict their outcomes 
lawsuits have been filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors 
class action lawsuits have been filed in which the plaintiffs allege numerous violations of the securities laws  we cannot predict the outcome of these cases 
suits in six states are outstanding alleging that our pricing practices violated applicable consumer protection laws and racketeering laws 
cases against us regarding consumer protection and racketeering allegations have been dismissed in the state courts of florida  oregon and new jersey and in the federal courts in alabama and california  but we cannot predict the outcome of an appeal  if any  nor can we predict the outcome of any of the other cases in other jurisdictions 
in addition  given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our other suppliers to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
we obtain approximately of our pharmaceutical supplies from a single supplier  mckesson  pursuant to a long term supply contract 
pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and therefore our relationship with mckesson is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationships with our suppliers  particularly our relationship with mckesson  would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business  and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
several of our executive officers have joined rite aid very recently 
we cannot assure you that management will be able to successfully manage our business or successfully implement our strategic plan 
since december  we have hired a new management team  including robert g 
miller as chief executive officer and chairman 
our management team has considerable experience in the retail industry 
nonetheless  we cannot assure you that management will be able to successfully manage our business or successfully implement our strategic business plan 
we are now depending on our new management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer  mr 
miller  and the other members of our new management team 
the loss of mr 
miller or other key personnel due to death  disability or termination of employment could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial condition  or both 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
we are currently in negotiations to sell pcs but our efforts may not be successful 
we acquired pcs for approximately billion in january the acquisition was financed exclusively with short term debt 
in the third quarter of fiscal  rite aid solicited indications of interest for the possible sale of pcs to address its short term liquidity problems 
the indications of interest received at that time were not deemed adequate and the receipt by pcs and another major participant in the pbm industry of a subpoena regarding certain customary business practices further complicated the efforts to sell pcs 
in connection with the debt restructuring completed in june  rite aid negotiated with its lenders to retain the ability to continue to own and operate pcs 
following the completion of the refinancing  with the flexibility to reject inadequate offers  management reopened discussions with several parties concerning the possible sale of pcs 
we are currently negotiating seriously with one interested party  however  no agreement has been entered into 
while an agreement to sell pcs could be announced at any time  it is also possible that our current negotiations will not lead to an agreement and we will continue to own and operate pcs 
based on proposals currently under discussion  we expect to incur a substantial loss upon a commitment to sell of pcs 
see management s discussion of results of operations and financial condition general 
we need to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition but our operations will not improve if we cannot effectively implement our business strategy 
our operations during the fiscal year ended february  were adversely affected by a number of factors  including our financial difficulties  inventory shortages  allegations of violations of the law  including drug pricing issues  problems with suppliers and uncertainties regarding rite aid s ability to produce audited financial statements 
to improve operations  new management developed and has been implementing a business strategy to improve the pricing of products  provide more consistent advertising through weekly  national circulars  eliminate problems with shortages of inventory and out dated inventory  resolve all issues with our vendors  develop programs intended to enhance customer relationships and provide better service and continue to improve our stores and the product offerings within our stores 
if we are not successful in our efforts to implement our business strategy  or if our business strategy is not effective we may not be able to improve our operations 
failure to improve operations would adversely affect our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
the additional unregistered shares of rite aid common stock that we issued may depress the market price of rite aid common stock because we have has agreed to register those shares under the securities act to enable the holders of the shares to sell them 
in connection with the refinancing of our debt  we agreed to register the  shares of rite aid common stock that it issued to the lenders under its rcf credit facility  pcs credit facility and demand note 
in addition  we have agreed to register the  shares of rite aid common stock underlying as of june  the series b convertible preferred stock that it issued in october and the  shares of rite aid common stock underlying the warrant issued to jp morgan ventures corporation in october the possible public sale of such large numbers of shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of rite aid s common stock 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increased competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drug store chains  independent drug stores  internet retailers and mass merchandisers 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases in the markets in which we operate  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are reimbursed by third party payors for approximately of all of the prescription drugs that we sell 
these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  if medicare is reformed to include prescription benefits  medicare may cover some of the prescription drugs that we now sell at retail prices  and we may be reimbursed at prices lower than our current retail prices 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or their significant change could hurt our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to several federal  state  and local regulations 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations  and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as health care reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
certain risks are inherent in the provision of pharmacy services  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products 
if the economy slows down and unemployment increases or inflationary conditions worry consumers  consumers will decrease their purchases  particularly of products other than pharmaceutical products that they need for health reasons 
we make a higher profit on our sales of front end products than we do on sales of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  any decrease in our sales of front end products will decrease our profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s rite aid s future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense 
since the end of fiscal  rite aid s primary risk exposure has not changed 
the company enters into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february  fair value at february  thereafter total debt in thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rates in june  rite aid refinanced certain variable and fixed rate obligations maturing in fiscal years and and entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of million of rite aid s variable rate debt at for a two year period 
in july  rite aid entered into an additional interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of an additional million of variable rate debt at for a two year period 
as a result of these financing activities  rite aid s ratio of variable rate exposure changed from as of february  to as of july  our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that any such borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
as of june   rite aid had three credit facilities the new billion senior secured credit facility entered into on june   and the rcf credit facility and pcs credit facility 
in addition  it had fixed rate obligations in the amount of billion and exchange debt in the amount of million 
in march  all remaining commercial paper obligations were repaid 
the ratings on these credit facilities and obligations as of june  were as follows the billion rcf facility b by standard and poor s and b by moody s  the billion senior secured credit facility bb by standard poor s and ba by moody s  the billion pcs facility b by standard poor s and b by moody s  the fixed rate obligations b by standard poor s and caa by moody s  and the exchange debt is not rated yet 
the interest rates on the variable rate borrowings are as follows the billion rcf revolving credit facility libor plus  the billion senior secured credit facility libor plus  and the billion pcs facility and the exchange debt libor plus 
further downgrades of rite aid s credit ratings would not impact the rate on the borrowings under the credit facilities 
the interest rate on the rcf and pcs credit facilities and the exchange debt is subject to a per annum increase if we have not received million of net proceeds from asset sales by november  changes in one month libor affect rite aid s cost of borrowings because the interest rate on rite aid s variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of and as of february  and june   respectively  rite aid s annual interest expense would change by approximately million and million  respectively  based upon rite aid s variable rate debt outstanding of approximately billion and billion as of february  and june   respectively 
a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
