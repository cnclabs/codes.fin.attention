this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities

at december  compared to 
at december  our total assets at december  aggregated million compared to million at december  our restaurants are a cash business 
funds available from cash sales are not needed to finance receivables and are not generally needed immediately to pay for food  supplies and certain other expenses of the restaurants 
therefore  our business and operations have not historically required proportionately large amounts of working capital  which is generally common among similar restaurant companies 
should dynamic foods expand its sales to third parties  the accounts receivable and inventory related to such sales could require us to maintain additional working capital 
cafeteria operators has outstanding million of notes due december   including million of accrued interest 
under the terms of the notes  a semi annual cash payment of approximately million is due on each march and september the obligations of cafeteria operators under the notes are secured by a security interest in and a lien on all of the personal property of cafeteria operators and mortgages on all fee and leasehold properties of cafeteria operators to the extent such properties are mortgageable

during the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   furr s expended million  million and million  respectively  principally to maintain and remodel existing cafeterias  upgrade its computer and information systems  construct two new units and improve the facility operated by dynamic foods 
the increase in capital expenditures in and was primarily due to a significant reimaging program 
we expect to continue this program in the year our capital expenditure program is necessary to enable us and our subsidiaries to increase our revenue and profitability 
subject to our ability to generate necessary funds from operations or to obtain funds from other sources  we intend to pursue a program of remodeling existing restaurants and opening new restaurants 
we anticipate expending approximately million in fiscal year to remodel existing cafeterias  open new restaurants and make other capital expenditures 
no assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient funds from operations or obtain alternative financing to enable us to fully implement the desired capital expenditures 
our ability to open new restaurants will also depend  among other things  upon our ability to secure appropriate store locations on favorable terms and to identify  hire and train personnel for expansion 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
from time to time  we consider whether disposition of certain of our assets  including our food processing and distribution operations  real estate owned in fee simple and leasehold interests or potential acquisitions of assets would be beneficial or appropriate for our long term goals and in order to increase stockholder value 
in  we entered into an amendment of a master sublease agreement pursuant to which we leased properties from kmart corporation kmart 
pursuant to the amendment  the aggregate monthly rent was reduced by percent for the period from the effective date of the amendment through and including december   and by percent following that date and until december  the reductions in rent were made subject to termination by kmart if mr 
kevin lewis ceased to be chairman of the board of directors of furr s 
mr 
lewis was not nominated for reelection at our annual meeting of stockholders on may  in june  kmart demanded that we pay increased rents  which we have done while reserving our right to dispute kmart s right to receive the increased rental 
as a result of the increased rents  we will pay additional rent of approximately million through december   including million additional rent paid in because we account for our rental payments under the straight line method  the purported increase in rent through december  is being amortized over the remaining life of the leases  which run through december   december   june  and december  the increase in annual rent expense amounted to approximately thousand for fiscal and for the fiscal will amount to approximately thousand 
furr s and certain of our subsidiaries and other defendants entered into a definitive settlement agreement that resolved all outstanding claims among us related to the litigation and irs audit involving our pension plan 
the calculations included in the agreement have been confirmed by an independent actuary and the settlement approved as fair to all members of the plaintiff class by the court 
the cash impact of the settlement on furr s includes payment in of million of expenses for legal and professional fees  with the remainder of the settlement to be paid to the plan in future years to fund increased benefit payments to former and current employees 
the settlement will not require any funding payments to the plan by furr s in but is expected to require payments by furr s to the plan of approximately million in and approximately thousand in  with additional funding payments required in subsequent years in amounts that are expected to decline over time  subject to the overall funding status of the plan 
new york stock exchange listing in july  the new york stock exchange the exchange notified furr s that it was not in compliance with its revised listing standards 
the exchange has accepted our proposed plan to attain compliance with the exchange s revised listing standards on or before july  and is allowing continued trading of our common stock on the exchange so long as interim objectives are realized 
there can be no assurance that we will meet our objectives as outlined in our plan as submitted to the exchange or that the common stock of furr s will continue to be traded on the exchange 
if our common stock is delisted from the exchange  we plan to apply for listing on another exchange or to seek to establish trading in another market 
year disclosure as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any significant disruptions in our operations during the transition into the year yk 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our assessment of yk risks and had formulated contingency plans to mitigate potential adverse effects which might have arisen from noncompliant systems or third parties who had not adequately addressed the yk issue 
to date  we have not incurred any significant costs related to yk issues 
we will continue to monitor our operations and systems and address any date related problems that may arise as the year progresses 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
we purchase certain commodities used in food preparation 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
our long term debt does not expose us to market risk as all interest accrues at fixed rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage overall borrowing costs 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets
