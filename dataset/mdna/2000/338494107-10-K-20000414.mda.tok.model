item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements  all included elsewhere herein 
the information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
many factors  including but not limited to those discussed below under factors that may affect future results could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements below 
overview flanders is a full range air filtration product company engaged in designing  manufacturing and marketing high performance  mid range and standard grade air filtration products and certain related products and services 
we focus on those products with high replacement potential 
we also design and manufacture much of our own production equipment and also produce glass based media for many of our air filtration products 
from to  we experienced significant growth from the acquisition of other air filtration related companies 
as of march   we acquired the taffco group  a regional air filter sales and service distributor headquartered in virginia 
as of june   we acquired eco air 
eco air specializes in the manufacture and sale of air filtration products to markets on the west coast ranging from high end hepa filters through standard grade filters 
the results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  historical results of operations for the periods presented should be evaluated specifically in the context of these acquisitions 
additionally  the historical results of operations do not reflect any future operating efficiencies and improvements from integrating and consolidating the acquired businesses into our operations 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve these objectives and gains in efficiency 
we believe the acquisitions will have a positive impact on its future results of operations 
also in  we established sierra ridge filtration  inc  a direct distributor of air filtration products with sales offices located in the western united states 
results of operations compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income from continuing operations   earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   provision for income taxes   earnings from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations   net earnings   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  for  from  for the increase in net sales was due to i the acquisitions of eco air and the tidewater group  which contributed approximately  of net sales  and ii the company s success in attracting work and expanding its original core business  which grew by approximately between and and contributed an additional  to net sales 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which represented of net sales  compared to  which represented for this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to o higher margins on sales made through our direct sales offices  which made significant contributions to sales of our products for the first time during the last half of  o margin improvement from our ongoing automation projects  o operational efficiencies at our newest facilities in nevada  illinois and north carolina  which are gradually increasing over time and should increase to the levels experienced historically at other plants during the next twelve to eighteen months  and o internally produced spun glass media for our residential and commercial flat panel furnace and air conditioning filters began in significant quantities during the fourth quarter of  providing an estimated savings of approximately  o hurricane floyd which caused us to close four of our plants in the eastern united states for periods ranging from days to days 
there is an associated insurance claim whose amount has not yet been determined  which will be booked as other income during the period in which the amount becomes fully determined 
operating expenses operating expenses during increased  or to  representing of net sales  compared to  for  which represented of net sales 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisitions of eco air and the tidewater group  which added approximately  in operating expenses 
excluding these acquisitions  operating expenses increased  from compared to this increase is primarily due to the establishment of direct sales offices during the last part of and all of  which offset the increase in gross profit margin attributable to direct office operations 
other factors affecting operating expenses included decreased expenditures for new product development expenditures between and  the consolidation and centralization of overhead functions  increased in outbound freight expenses related to increased sales and higher fuel costs  and increased sales commission expenses associated with increased sales 
discontinued operations in december  we adopted a formal plan to close airseal west  a wholly owned subsidiary  and sell its various assets and product lines to unrelated third parties 
the anticipated date of closure is approximately april  all dispositions of assets are expected to be completed before december  the assets to be sold consist primarily of accounts receivable  inventories  manufacturing equipment  designs and other intellectual properties 
the estimated net loss of the discontinued operations of approximately  represents approximately  of losses incurred during and  of estimated loss on the disposal of the assets of airseal west both figures net of income tax benefit 
during  operating losses from airseal west were approximately  net of income tax benefit 
provision for taxes our income tax provision for increased  or  to  from  for  which represented and of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  respectively 
our tax provision increased because of larger amounts of nondeductible expenses  primarily amortization of goodwill  and certain one time adjustments related to estimated accrued income taxes 
our blended rate state and federal tax rate  excluding the effect of nondeductible expenses consisting primarily of amortization of goodwill of approximately  per year and one time adjustments  is approximately 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations for decreased  or  to  or per share basic diluted  compared to  or per share basic diluted  for the decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to decreases in net nonoperating income expense  consisting primarily of additional interest expense and reduced interest income  and an increase in our effective income tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income from continuing operations   earnings from continuing operations before income taxes   provision for income taxes   earnings from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations  net earnings   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to i the acquisition of eco air  which contributed approximately  of net sales  and ii the company s success in attracting work and expanding its original core business  which grew by approximately between and and contributed an additional  to net sales 
the company experienced reductions in sales of its laminar flow hepa products for cleanroom applications  which were balanced by increased sales of its ashrae rated mid range products for industrial and commercial applications 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which represented of net sales  compared to  which represented for the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin percentage were i the consolidation of the company s airpure facility  located in selma  north carolina  into the company s new facility in nearby smithfield  north carolina  which took place during the fourth quarter of and resulted in extended periods of downtime due to equipment movement  calibration and production flow refinement  as well as other direct costs associated with moving equipment and inventory from the old facility to the new plant  ii higher than normal costs  mostly during the first three quarters of  associated with new facilities in henderson  nevada and smithfield  north carolina  consisting primarily of labor inefficiencies associated with training new production employees and installation of new equipment  iii higher than normal freight costs associated with shipping products from established facilities to meet demand from new geographical areas while additional equipment was installed in various plants  and iv inefficiencies associated with irregular orders and slowdowns at ffi s facility in washington  north carolina 
these decreases in gross profit were partially balanced by efficiencies associated with the company s ongoing automation project for stock product lines  which is substantially complete for the company s highest volume products 
operating expenses operating expenses during increased  or to  representing of net sales  compared to  for  which represented of net sales 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of eco air  which added approximately  in operating expenses 
excluding eco air  operating expenses increased  from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  major factors affecting operating expenses included approximately  in research and development expenditures for the development of new product lines  compared to approximately  in  the consolidation and centralization of overhead functions  and increased sales commission expense associated with increase sales 
net income net income for decreased  or  to  or per share basic diluted  compared to  or per share basic diluted  for the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the company s decrease in profit margin as a percentage of sales 
effects of inflation the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was  at december   compared to  at december  this includes cash and cash equivalents of  and  at december  and  respectively 
trade receivables increased  or  to  at december  from  at december  the increase in receivables is primarily due to increases associated with the increased volume of net sales approximately  and timing differences in shipments and payments received 
continuing operations generated  of cash during  compared to generating  during the difference in cash flows was associated with smaller increases in inventories during compared to  and an increase in accounts payable of  in compared to a decrease of  in financing activities for continuing operations consumed  during of cash  primarily from payments on debt financing 
investing activities for continuing operations consumed  of cash during  consisting primarily of the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and cash paid for the acquisition of the tidewater group 
the purchase price  including expenses and net of cash received  was approximately  the acquisition of tidewater was funded from operating cash flow and the company s revolving credit facility 
the effective date of the acquisition for financial statement purposes was april   and financial statements include the operating activities and assets of the tidewater group from that date 
on february   we completed the extension of our  revolving line of credit facility with suntrust 
outstanding balances on the credit line bear interest at the option of the company  at either a the prime rate of interest publicly announced by suntrust bank  which was at december   or b the libor rate as reported by the wall street journal  which was at december   plus an amount equal to to  depending on the ratio of total liabilities of the company to its tangible net worth 
as of december   the company had used  of the revolving credit facility 
unless this line of credit is renewed  it will expire in june as of april   we entered into a loan agreement and issued a note to the johnston county industrial facilities and pollution control financing authority and such authority issued industrial development revenue bonds the bonds for an aggregate of  the proceeds of which were loaned for the construction of a  square foot manufacturing facility in johnston county  north carolina 
the note extends for a term of fifteen years and bears interest at a variable rate determined by the remarketing agent of the bonds on a weekly basis equal to the minimum rate necessary to sell such bonds at their par value which  as of december   was per annum 
the bonds are collateralized by a  letter of credit which expires in june continuing expansion may require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
although we have been able to arrange debt facilities or equity financing to date  there can be no assurance that sufficient debt financing or equity will continue to be available in the future  or that it will be available on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact our growth strategy 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of the company s common stock 
as of march   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock under this authorization  thus  as of this date  up to an additional  shares are available for repurchase 
these shares may be acquired in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
these repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
these repurchases are to be used primarily to satisfy the company s obligations under its stock option and purchase plans or any other authorized incentive plans  or for issuance pursuant to future equity financing by the company 
effective with the engagement of painewebber in march  repurchases under the plan were suspended 
outlook during  we saw the first signs that our newly established manufacturing facilities are beginning to complete their start up phases 
efficiency at these new facilities is beginning to increase 
we expect this process to continue for the next eighteen months  until the new plants reach our goals for material utilization  labor productivity and throughput 
critical to this process  however  will be our success in obtaining additional sales to more fully utilize the production capacity we have put into place 
in july  we established a national contracts sales group 
this group is focused on obtaining national supply agreements with major industrial end users  typically with purchases from us by each such customer expected to exceed million per year 
these types of customers are not typically accessible to our predominantly regional representative and distributor organizations  and so remain a largely untapped market for us 
while it is difficult to predict the precise magnitude of sales that will actually result from this endeavor  we have targeted customers with aggregate annual air filtration requirements in excess of million 
to date  we have received our first major contract for this market segment  a three year exclusive arrangement to provide filters to a major hvac system manufacturer which is expected to contribute at least million to annual sales  which began in the fourth quarter of during the year  we negotiated joint venture agreements with major air filter distributors or manufacturers in several different areas in the pacific rim  including australia  korea  malaysia  singapore  taiwan  hong kong and china 
these arrangements are structured so that we sell the ventures proprietary materials and provide certain proprietary equipment 
these agreements are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during the year however  we hope that the ventures will become a significant source of revenue and income in the future 
during  we finished our internal verification of a new indoor air quality system targeted toward commercial office buildings 
this product  part of our engineered services group  uses air quality monitoring  computer models and automated data collection to develop a complete analysis of a building s air quality over time  which is then used to generate and verify solutions to air quality problems 
while the installations of this technology currently in place are not material to our results  and sales from this product are not expected to be a material contributor in the year  we believe this combination of filtration products and engineering services is the best way to address indoor air quality problems  including sick building syndrome  and believe the potential market for this application exceeds million 
we believe the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a cyclical slowdown in capital spending for new facilities  and thus on spending for cleanroom filtration products  since the first quarter of while we expect capital spending for new semiconductor facilities to increase in the future  this was not a significant factor in our overall business during less than of our sales in and were from high end products sold for use in the semiconductor industry 
during the first quarter of  we have seen definite signs that the semiconductor industry will require additional capacity in the near future  including price increases in commodity dram markets and several new facility announcements 
therefore  we expect sales for products used in semiconductor plants to increase through the rest of we have collected data that indicates that residential filter users replace their filters  on average  approximately once per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air conditioning systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on our business 
we believe there is currently a gradually increasing public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality and that this trend will continue for the next several years 
we also believe there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of indoor air quality on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest by standards making bodies in creating specifications and techniques for detecting  defining and solving indoor air quality problems 
we further believe there will be an increase in interest in our absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products may be used in both semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants to prevent cross contamination between different lots and different processes being performed at the same facility 
these products also increase production yields in many applications 
our most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away spun glass filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these products with higher value products 
our higher value products include our naturalaire higher efficiency filters for residential use  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on our business 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  our penetration of this market has been relatively small 
we believe our ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers may increase our share of this market 
we also believe that our recently developed modular air handlers and environmental tobacco smoke systems will enable us to expand sales to these customers 
we intend our new products to serve as high profile entrants with distributors and manufacturers representatives  who can then be motivated to carry our complete product line 
this outlook section  and other portions of this document  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  among others  those statements preceded by  following or including the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate or similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the current expectations of management and are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include those discussed below under the heading factors that may affect future results as well as o the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  o changes in external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  o anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  o changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  o product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  and o various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
factors that may affect future results our failure to manage future growth could adversely impact our business due to the strain on our management  financial and other resources if our business continues to grow  the additional growth will place burdens on management to manage such growth while maintaining profitability 
we have no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
due to our recent acquisitions and expansions  our net sales increased by approximately from through  a compound annual growth rate of 
we may not continue to expand at this rate 
our ability to compete effectively and manage future growth depends on our ability to o recruit  train and manage our work force  particularly in the areas of corporate management  accounting  research and development and operations  o manage production and inventory levels to meet product demand  o manage and improve production quality  o expand both the range of customers and the geographic scope of our customer base  and o improve financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must develop  produce and sell new products that keep up with rapid technological change to maintain approximately of our revenues and maintain value of our inventory and other assets as of december   approximately of our revenues resulted from sales of high end filtration products that are especially vulnerable to new technology development 
our ability to remain competitive in this area will depend in part upon our ability to o anticipate technological changes  o develop new and enhanced filtration systems that meet our customers needs  and o introduce these systems at competitive prices in a timely and cost efficient manner 
we have no assurance that we will successfully anticipate future technological changes or that technologies or systems developed by others will not render our technology obsolete 
additionally  we have no assurance that the products we develop will be commercially viable 
a failure to successfully anticipate future technological changes could also require us to write down inventories  equipment or other assets associated with obsolete products or dispose of these assets at a price lower than book value  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive 
this competition may increase as new competitors enter the market 
several of these competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
additionally  our competitors may introduce new products or enhancements to products that could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by o increasing our market share  o expanding our market through the introduction of new products which require periodic replacement  and o improving operating efficiencies 
although our executive management team continues to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
our market share may not continue to increase if we are unable to acquire additional synergistic businesses in the past several years we have significantly increased our market share by acquiring synergistic businesses 
although we intend to continue to increase our market share in this manner  we have no assurance that future acquisition opportunities will be available 
additionally  in the future we may not have access to the substantial debt or equity financing to finance potential acquisitions 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
our strategy of growth through acquisition also exposes us to the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
we do not currently have any binding agreements with respect to future acquisitions 
our business may suffer if our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market is unsuccessful we are developing new products as part of our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market 
we have no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we have no guarantee that any new products we develop will gain acceptance in the marketplace  or that these products will be successful 
additionally  we have no assurance we will be able to recoup the expenditures associated with the development of these products 
to succeed in this area we must o increase public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality  o adequately address the unknown requirements of the potential customer base  o develop new products that are competitive in terms of price  performance and quality  and o avoid significant increases in current expenditure levels in development  marketing and consumer education 
we may experience critical equipment failure which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we experience extended periods of downtime due to the malfunction or failure of our automated production equipment  our business  financial condition and operations may suffer 
we design  manufacture and assemble the majority of the automated production equipment used in our facilities 
we also use other technologically advanced equipment for which manufacturers may have limited production capability or service experience 
if we are unable to quickly repair our equipment or quickly obtain new equipment or parts from outside manufacturers  we could experience extended periods of downtime in the event of malfunction or equipment failure 
if automation of our production lines fails to produce the projected results  our business will suffer we have only recently substantially completed a program to increase our gross margins by automating portions of our production lines 
although the designs have been extensively tested in the field  we have no assurance that the new equipment will produce the expected beneficial results on our gross margins 
additionally  we are not certain that any increases in efficiencies will not be offset in the marketplace by competitors making similar improvements to their facilities 
our plan to centralize overhead functions may not produce the anticipated benefits to our operating results we are currently implementing plans to centralize and eliminate duplication of efforts between our subsidiaries in the following areas o purchasing  o production planning  o shipping coordination  o marketing  o accounting  o personnel management  o risk management  and o benefit plan administration 
we have no assurance that cutting overhead in this fashion will have the anticipated benefits to our operating results 
additionally  we have no assurance that these reorganizations will not significantly disrupt the operations of the affected subsidiaries 
our success depends on our ability to retain and attract key personnel our success and future operating results depend in part upon our ability to retain our executives and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
our success also depends on our ability to attract highly qualified engineering  manufacturing  technical  sales and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
our failure to attract or retain such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current distribution channels may be unavailable if our manufacturers representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors we provide our manufacturers representatives with the ability to offer a full product line of air filtration products to existing and new customers 
some of our competitors offer similar arrangements 
we do not have exclusive relationships with most of our representatives 
consequently  if our representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors  our current distribution channels  and hence  our sales  could be significantly reduced 
management controls a significant percentage of our stock as of december   our directors and executive officers beneficially held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  such shareholders effectively control or significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval 
these matters include the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we may be required to issue stock in the future that will dilute the value of our existing stock if we issue the following securities  such securities may dilute the value of the securities that our existing stockholders now hold 
we have granted warrants to purchase of total of  of our shares of common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
all of the warrants are currently exercisable 
as a result  if the warrant holders exercise these warrants  we will issue shares of stock that will generally be available for sale in the public market 
we have granted options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the majority of these options are currently exercisable 
additionally  most of the common stock issuable upon the exercise of these options is registered on a form s as a result  if the option holders exercise these options  we will issue shares of stock that will generally be available for sale in the public market 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of our charter provisions and north carolina law our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are designed to provide our board of directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders 
these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control in our business 
additionally  we are subject to the control shares acquisition act of the state of north carolina 
this act provides that any person who acquires control shares of a publicly held north carolina corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation vote to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would typically provide 
our business can be significantly affected by environmental laws the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations may significantly influence our business and products 
these laws and regulations require that certain environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while we endeavor at each of our facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  we cannot be certain that our operations or activities  or historical operations by others at our locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we have  in the past  and may  in the future  purchase or lease properties with unresolved potential violations of federal or state environmental regulations 
in these transactions  we have been successful in obtaining sufficient indemnification and mitigating the impact of the issues without recognizing significant expenses associated with litigation and cleanup 
however  purchasing or leasing these properties requires us to weigh the cost of resolving these issues and the likelihood of litigation against the potential economic and business benefits of the transaction 
if we fail to correctly identify  resolve and obtain indemnification against these risks  they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for the company  these exposures are primarily related to the sale of product to foreign customers and changes in interest rates 
the company does not have any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total debt at december  was approximately  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels of local currency prices  as the preponderance of its foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are demarcated in us dollars
