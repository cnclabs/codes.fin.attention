both major components of net revenue  computer software license and service fees  increased in and over the previous years 
computer software license fees increased in all the company s product lines 
in  accounting software license fees  which account for of the company s total software license fees  increased over and estimating software license fees  which account for of total software license fees  increased 
the increase in accounting software license fees was primarily due to an increase in fees generated from the company s gold collection r for construction accounting 
the company believes this increase was primarily due to three factors the continued strength in the construction industry  the increasing dominance of our products in our targeted markets  and the need by many companies to upgrade or replace their existing software which was not year compliant 
however  the latter factor also had a negative impact on license fees during the latter part of  as the company believes some companies deferred their decisions to acquire new software until there were also no significant new software products released in that increased license fees as there were in estimating software license fees increased in primarily due to one software licensing arrangement during the first quarter of  which was the single largest software license in the company s history 
in  accounting software license fees  which accounted for of the company s total software license fees  increased over  primarily due to the increase in license fees from the company s gold collection for construction accounting 
the increase was primarily due to the factors stated above for in addition  the increase in accounting software license fees was due to the release of new software products which were not available  or available for only part of the year  in these products include the accounts receivable product  released in december  the billing module released in may  and the company s gold collection for property management  which was released in march estimating software license fees accounted for of the company s total license fees in and increased over the previous year 
the company believes this increase was also due primarily to the continued strength in the construction industry and additional license revenue from the company s precision collection r extended edition  which was released in september in terms of revenue mix  software license fees accounted for  and of net revenue in  and  respectively 
a large majority of the company s software license revenue is from the united states 
international non us software license fees  as a percentage of total software license fees  remained constant at for  and service fees are comprised primarily of fees from annual maintenance and technical support service plans and fees for consulting and training 
service fees in increased significantly over primarily due to an increase in fees from annual maintenance and technical support service plans 
fees from these service plans  which account for over of the company s total service fees in  increased  primarily due to the increase in the company s user base through new product sales  the revision in the pricing structure for these plans which was instituted during the first quarter of  and an increase in the percentage of users renewing their annual service plans 
the company also believes the increase is due to a higher quality of service being provided to its users as a result of a significant re engineering and restructuring of the way it provides telephone support 
consulting fees increased over the prior year 
although consulting fees are not a large portion of our business yet  the company has targeted this area as a source for future growth 
training fees remained essentially flat because  in the latter part of  the company transferred the primary responsibility of holding training classes for users to its independent resellers 
the reduction in training revenue was offset by increased sales of training materials 
for  the increase in service fees over was also primarily due to the increase in fees from annual maintenance and support services plans 
fees from these service plans  which accounted for of total service fees in  increased due to an increase in new users and a price increase for these plans 
consulting fees increased over the prior year 
training fees increased in over primarily due to an increase in training material sales to its resellers  who are taking a more active role in conducting training classes in their geographical area 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of software documentation  assembly and shipping costs  royalties paid to outside developers  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and cost of facilities and outside services for training and consulting 
cost of revenue increased significantly in over  but as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at 
the increase in the dollar amount for cost of revenue was primarily due to higher costs related to software license and consulting fees 
these fees increased significantly in over in  cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenue  declined slightly from the decrease in this percentage was primarily due to lower costs associated with software license fees and lower costs associated with software release to users on annual software maintenance plans 
this was partially offset by increased costs for amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalties and training costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
these expenses increased in both and over the previous year 
however  as a percentage of net revenue  they declined to in from in and in expenses for client services previously titled customer support increased in over primarily due to two factors 
about a third of the increase was due to an increase in personnel costs for performing consulting services  for which the company s revenue from this service grew in the remainder of the increase is primarily related to higher personnel costs required to retain and hire highly qualified technical support specialists to handle the telephone support volume and outside costs incurred to assist the company in re engineering and restructuring the support organization to make it more efficient 
call volume in increased about over the previous year  while support staff dedicated to this function has remained fairly constant 
as a percentage of service fees  client services expenses decreased to in from in in  client services expenses increased over due to additional personnel hired to handle the increased demand for support  training and consulting services as a result of the continued increase in accounting software license fees 
as a percentage of service fees  client services expenses increased to in from in product development expenses represent expenses for research and development on new software products as well as enhancements and ongoing updates to the company s existing software products 
in  product development expenses increased over primarily due to additional personnel hired to develop and design new enhancements on ongoing updates to the company s existing software products as well as research on future software products 
the increase in expenses was also due to the use of outside developers to assist the company in its development efforts 
in  the increase in product development expenses over was primarily due to additional personnel hired not only for designing and developing enhancements to the company s software products and research on new products  but also for the testing of such enhancements 
additionally  capitalized software development costs  which reduce the amount of product development expenses recognized  amounted to in compared to in this would account for nearly of the increase in over the company is working on a number of enhancements to its existing product line  as well as new products 
in july  the company announced that it will enter the project management market 
the company is also developing new products and enhancements to its current products which are web enabled and will facilitate e commerce 
consequently  the company believes that it will continue to commit a significant amount of its resources toward product development in sales and marketing expenses in increased significantly over  but as a percentage of net revenue  declined slightly from a year ago 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and trade show costs in the marketing area  increased sales commissions related to the company s direct sales  and an increase in international marketing expenses 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased modestly over s level  but as a percentage of net revenue  declined from the previous year 
the increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased advertising and trade show costs and to a lesser extent  international marketing activities 
the increase in marketing expenses was partially offset by a slight reduction in sales expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased slightly from the previous year  but declined as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in expense is primarily due to higher amortization expense  primarily related to the company s new information system which became operational in september  and an increase in outside service costs  including insurance and legal costs 
the increase in these costs was partially offset by the absence in of moving costs the company incurred in related to the move to its new corporate offices 
general and administrative expenses in increased over primarily because of these moving expenses and higher insurance  legal and other professional service costs 
however  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses declined from its level 
other income expense 
other income expense is primarily composed of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments 
other income increased significantly in over due to the significant increase in investable funds 
interest income increased slightly in over during  the company used a portion of its investable cash to finance the construction of its new corporate offices 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the slight increase in this rate year over year is primarily due to the increase in the company s pre tax earnings and a slight reduction in the effect of the research tax credit on its effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company generally meets its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operations was  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations in and was primarily due to the increased profitability in the company s operations 
working capital increased to  at december  from  at december  primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments 
this was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenues  as discussed below 
the company s financial position continues to be very strong 
the company has no long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments amounted to  at december  and represent of the company s total assets 
these cash resources have increased  since the end of  primarily due to the increase in cash provided by operations and despite the repayment of  in the first quarter of on a construction loan related to its new corporate offices 
accounts receivable net at december  decreased slightly since the end of and the dso s days sales outstanding in accounts receivable declined to days from days at december  while net property and equipment remained about the same at the end of compared to  purchased software increased  in due to cost incurred for the company s new information system and the purchase in october of a software product for the company s property management product line 
capitalized software costs increased during  primarily due to development costs incurred and other capitalized costs incurred to embed an sql database engine into the company s software products 
deferred revenues increased  during to  at december  it is composed primarily of billings related to the company s maintenance and technical support service plans 
because billings for these plans generally cover a twelve month period  practically all of the deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in the company believes that its current cash balances and temporary investments  along with future cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its operating needs for at least the next months 
the company plans to continue to invest significant resources toward product development  which may include internal software development  acquiring new technology or new products which will complement our existing product lines  and other strategic opportunities that arise 
other future cash needs will  or may  include additional investments for equipment for company personnel  additional expenditures for expansion of the company s corporate offices and properties  a stock repurchase program and the payment of cash dividends 
the company currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends and plans to continue to pay such dividends  consistent with its capital needs and income levels 
total cash dividends paid in amounted to  or 
per share  compared to  or 
per share in and or 
per share in although the company believes that it has sufficient cash and temporary investments on hand to meet its operating needs and other cash requirements for at least the next months  events may occur that require funds in excess of what the company has available 
if such events were to occur  the company may borrow money against its real property or seek other debt or equity financing 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may make forward looking statements as such term is defined in the federal securities laws 
the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such forward looking statements are as follows year compliance 
many companies that use and or develop computer software have been addressing  or are continuing to address  the problem of their software not being year compliant 
the problem that may exist with some computer software is that it will not process transactions properly for dates commencing in the year this is due to the fact that many computer software programs were designed to make date calculations based on the last two digits of the year 
as a result  dates in the year may be identified as dates in the year  which may cause incorrect calculations  cause the transaction to not be processed or  in some cases  cause an entire computer system to malfunction 
the company has been aware of this problem for many years and has addressed it  both for its software that it has developed for sale to users and for applications affecting internal operations that potentially are not year compliant 
on software developed for sale to users  the company believes that the complete suite of its current version of windows based products and its older dos based products which are currently being maintained by the company are year compliant 
to date  the company has not received any significant notices from its user base who are using the company s currently maintained software products of any problems encountered with the software as it relates to the year the company had also previously notified known users of its discontinued software products that it will not continue support of those products 
to date  the company has not received any significant inquiries regarding this 
during  the company completed its assessment of its internal operations in terms of technical applications  non technical applications and the effect of significant third parties upon whom it relies for various aspects of its business  to identify year compliance issues 
because of this assessment and the company s efforts to continuously upgrade and expand its internal information and telecommunication system  the company  to date  has not experienced any material operational problems in the year although the company did not budget specifically for year compliance costs  it believes that these costs were not significant 
based on its experience to date on the year compliance issue  the company does not believe there will be any significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows related to this issue 
however  this belief may change as a result of factors outside the control of the company or unforeseen events that may occur related to the year compliance issue 
various of the company s disclosures and announcements concerning its products and year programs are intended to constitute year readiness disclosures as defined in the year information and readiness disclosures act 
this act provides added protection from liability for certain public and private statements concerning an entity s year readiness and the year readiness of its products and services 
it also potentially provides added protection from liability for certain types of year disclosures made after january  and before the date of enactment of the act 
competition 
the computer software market is highly competitive and subject to change because of the rapid technological changes in the computer industry 
the number of software vendors with which the company competes varies from product to product and from region to region within the united states 
although the company believes it is a major supplier of project accounting and cost estimating software for the construction and property management industries  and that there are economical and technological barriers to discourage new specialty software vendors from entering into its segment of the software market  there can be no assurance that larger  better known software developers will not target this segment of the market 
such competitors are considerably larger and more diversified  have greater financial and other resources  and enjoy greater brand recognition for their products than the company 
the company must also compete with other larger  better known software developers for the hiring and retention of highly qualified technical personnel 
as a result  the company may have to expend additional financial resources to hire and retain qualified technical personnel 
if the company is not able to secure the services of employees with the level of technical expertise it requires  the development of new products would likely be delayed and would result in a decrease in the quality of new software products and enhancements to its existing software products 
a delay in the development  or failure to maintain the quality of new software products by the company  would likely have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
dependence on microsoft r operating system  obsolescence and technological changes 
the company is a specialty software developer  an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
its software is designed to work with specific operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
if substantial changes are made to those operating systems or if new operating systems are introduced and receive market acceptance  the company may need to invest additional resources to adapt its software to those changes or new operating systems 
also  other operating systems may be introduced on which the company s software may not function  which may also cause additional resources to be expended which would otherwise be devoted to improving the company s software or developing new software 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to make substantial expenditures for product development 
although the company plans to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop new products  the company s competitors may develop products with superior capabilities and or market their products more effectively at lower prices  by bundling their software with other software or through other methods 
the company believes its existing software products are widely accepted in its segment of the marketplace 
however  a delay in the release of new products or modifications to existing products  or a delay in the acceptance by the marketplace of any new products or modifications to existing products  could similarly delay the recognition of revenue  or have an adverse effect on the company s revenue and earnings 
substantial dependence on single industry 
because the company sells a large majority of its software products and services to the construction industry  adverse economic conditions in that industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue and earnings 
the construction industry is particularly sensitive to a significant increase in interest rates  which in the past has resulted in substantial financial distress across the industry 
in addition  a downturn in general economic conditions in the united states could adversely affect the construction industry 
product protection 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it by relying upon copyrights  trade secrets  internal nondisclosure agreements and transferability restrictions incorporated into its software license agreements 
the company believes the risk of unauthorized transfers of the company s proprietary information is reduced because program source listings are not released to third parties 
despite these restrictions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain information which the company regards as proprietary 
the company s competitive position could be adversely affected by unauthorized use of its proprietary information 
third parties may also assert infringement or other claims against the company with respect to any existing or future products 
litigation to protect the company s proprietary information or to determine the validity of any third party claims could result in significant expense to the company and  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of the company  divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from further development and support of the company s software products
