results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating results in include the results of the acquired compass businesses for a full twelve months the acquisition was completed in october and the results of jlw effective march  revenue total revenue  after elimination of intersegment revenue  increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw 
in addition  a million gain was recognized in  relating to the disposition of jones lang lasalle s former construction subsidiary  which was sold in a leveraged buyout in these increases were partially offset by lower management fees and leasing commissions  as well as lower performance fees generated on the disposition of assets under management during as compared to operating expenses total operating expenses  after elimination of intersegment expenses and excluding the effect of merger related non recurring charges  increased million  or  to million in as compared with million in  substantially as a result of the acquisition of compass and the jlw merger 
these two transactions also resulted in increases in personnel and office occupancy costs related to the global infrastructure added to support the larger size of the combined company  as well as increased global management and coordination costs associated with a global organization 
in addition  operating expenses increased as a result of additional goodwill amortization expense relating to the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw 
merger related non recurring charges totaled million in million of these charges for represent non cash compensation expense recorded as a result of shares issued to certain former employees of jlw in connection with the merger 
million of these charges represent non recurring transition and integration costs in  of which approximately million is attributable to the completion of the integration of the acquired compass businesses in the remaining transition expense relates to the merger with jlw and represents non capitalizable expenses such as rebranding  office consolidations and information technology initiatives 
operating income the resulting operating income in  excluding the effect of merger related non recurring charges  totaled million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
operating income as a percentage of total revenue  exclusive of merger related charges  was for as compared to in the operating results for have been negatively affected by four primary factors i management distractions caused by the integration of the compass and jlw operations  resulting in less generation of new business  ii increased infrastructure costs associated with the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw  iii a delay in the realization of anticipated cost savings from the jd edwards property accounting and information system and iv lower performance fees generated on the disposition of certain assets under management 
including the effect of the merger related non recurring charges  the operating loss in totaled million compared to operating income in of million 
segment operating results as a result of the merger with jlw  jones lang lasalle is managing its business along a combination of functional and geographic lines 
in the fourth quarter of  jones lang lasalle consolidated its operations in asia and australasia into a unified region now known as asia pacific 
accordingly  operations are now classified into five business segments two global businesses  i investment management and ii hotel services  and three geographic regions  iii the americas  iv europe and v asia pacific 
the investment management segment provides real estate investment management services to institutional investors  corporations and high net worth individuals 
the hotel services segment provides strategic advisory  sales  acquisition  valuation and asset management services related solely to hotel  conference and resort properties 
the geographic regions for the americas  europe and asia pacific each provide owner and occupier services which consist primarily of tenant representation and agency leasing  investment disposition and acquisition  and valuation services collectively  implementation services  and property  corporate property  development and project management services collectively  management fees 
results for and have been realigned based upon the current business segments 
owner and occupier services americas revenue for the americas region increased million  or  to million in compared to million in increased revenues were driven substantially by the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw  and to a lesser extent by an increased volume of transactions completed by the project management and tenant representation business units  which posted a million increase in revenue from strategic alliance clients 
in addition  the americas region recognized a gain of million associated with the disposition of jones lang lasalle s former construction subsidiary  which was sold in a leveraged buyout in december us gaap accounting requirements governing the accounting for this transaction did not permit the recognition of the gain in prior years 
these revenue gains were partially offset by a reduction in management fees and leasing commissions generated by the region s leasing management unit 
the reductions are primarily a function of the timing of property dispositions by clients  as compared to the timing of start dates for new assignments  in addition to slower new business generation in late and early as a result of management s integration efforts on the compass acquisition and jlw merger 
leasing commissions have been further impacted by the high occupancy rates of properties within the portfolio coupled with a lack of new construction or existing large blocks of office space 
this has resulted in more lease renewals  which generate lower fees than new leases  than in prior years 
to a lesser extent  the revenue for the americas region decreased as a result of performance fees generated during related to the lho initial public offering 
operating expenses for the americas region increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw and the resulting increase in personnel  office occupancy and goodwill amortization costs  in addition to added infrastructure to support the increased size of the combined company 
operating expenses increased to a lesser extent as a result of the continued expansion into south america and canada  resulting in investments in personnel and infrastructure for those units and incremental depreciation and infrastructure costs associated with the implementation and rollout of the jd edwards property accounting and information system 
these costs were partially offset by a cost reduction program which was initiated in the second half of and expanded in early that is anticipated to yield annualized savings of million beginning in in conjunction with this cost reduction program  the americas region recorded employee termination costs of approximately million in these costs were reflected as integration and transition expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings 
europe revenue for the europe region  which is substantially a new reportable segment as a result of the jlw merger and the acquisition of compass  totaled million in the revenue generated by the region primarily reflects robust activity within the united kingdom primarily in the form of tenant and agency leasing activities and investment sales and acquisition transactions 
in addition  property management  corporate property services and agency leasing activity in germany and france  as well as investment sales and acquisition transactions in germany and valuation transactions in france  were strong in  particularly in the latter half of the year 
the effect of a strong transaction flow was partially offset by a weakening of both the british pound and the euro during activity in central and eastern europe remained flat due to a lack of substantial economic growth 
operating expenses for the region totaled million in these expenses are composed primarily of personnel and office occupancy costs  as well as added infrastructure to support the increased size of the combined company 
in addition  these expenses include amortization of goodwill associated with the merger with jlw 
asia pacific the asia pacific region was formed in the last quarter of through a consolidation of the asia and australasia regions of the owner and occupier services segment  in order to capitalize on efficiencies in the regional infrastructure  promote sharing of best practices throughout the region and improve the delivery of products and services to clients 
revenue for the asia pacific region  also substantially a new reportable segment for jones lang lasalle as a result of the jlw merger  totaled million in this revenue was primarily generated by strong activity within hong kong  representing property management  agency leasing activity  consulting and valuation services  as well as management and leasing activity in australia and investment sales transactions in singapore 
this region continues to benefit from several positive trends in the australian real estate market  including continued economic growth funded by strong consumer spending and the outsourcing of property management functions by corporations and the australian government 
a revival in asia s real estate activity was boosted by a gradual economic recovery within the asian markets in  including a renewed interest from international investors  primarily in the latter half of the year 
however  conditions vary from country to country  and the benefits from the recovery in the areas noted above were partially offset by the stagnant market conditions in other areas of asia 
the currency valuation throughout most of asia remained stable for the period  inflation remained low  and property prices and rents in a number of the asia markets have begun to stabilize 
operating expenses totaled million in these expenses mainly represent personnel costs and office occupancy costs  as well as added infrastructure to support the increased size of the combined company 
in addition  these expenses include amortization of goodwill associated with the merger with jlw 
investment management investment management revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease for is primarily attributable to strong performance fees generated in on the disposition of certain assets under management in which jones lang lasalle had co investments  including certain hotel properties in connection with the formation of lho 
in addition  for a portion of  advisory fees were earned in relation to billion in assets under management related to the calpers portfolio 
these assets were transferred to the client s new investment advisor during the third quarter of and thus  no fees were earned on these assets in this decline was partially offset by increased revenue  resulting from the merger with jlw and to a lesser extent to a significant acquisition fee earned in  and increased equity earnings related to co investments 
in the latter half of  the investment management segment had its first closing on the euro fund and its first and second closings on the income and growth fund ii 
equity earnings are expected to increase in as a result of an anticipated gain on the disposition of a large portfolio  which was delayed from closing in late operating expenses increased million  or  to million in as compared with million in  primarily as a result of the merger with jlw and added infrastructure to support the increased size of the combined company 
the increase was partially offset by lower levels of incentive bonuses in as compared to as a result of the lower performance fees generated 
hotel services hotel services  a new reportable segment as a result of the recent merger  had total revenue of million in  representing a combination of valuation  disposition and acquisition services 
this segment experienced good activity in  primarily relating to disposition and acquisition services 
the segment benefited late in from the recovering asian real estate market and in late completed the sale of the seoul hilton 
this was a sizable single transaction  generating a large transaction fee for this segment 
however  in europe and the united states  several major transactions failed to close in as expected  thus creating a strong backlog at the end of the year 
these transactions are expected to close in operating expenses for the segment totaled million in these expenses mainly represent personnel costs and office occupancy costs 
interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  increased million to million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of compass and the related borrowings on the acquisition credit facility 
to a lesser extent  additional borrowings on the revolving credit facilities as a result of the transition and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of compass and merger with jlw contributed to the increase in interest expense 
in addition  on october  jones lang lasalle replaced its five year unsecured million revolving credit facility  million term credit facility and million short term facility with a new million unsecured credit agreement see liquidity and capital resources for discussion  which bears a higher rate of interest 
interest expense is expected to be significantly higher in as a result of an increase in the average level of debt outstanding  generally increasing interest rates and the likely refinancing of the portion of the credit facilities due october  at a higher rate of interest 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the generally lower level of earnings before provision for income taxes  exclusive of the compensation expense associated with the issuance of shares to former jlw employees in connection with the merger  which is largely nondeductible for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of merger related compensation expense and non recurring transition and integration expense  the effective tax rate on recurring operations increased from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in nondeductible goodwill amortization related to the merger with jlw and to the provision of valuation allowances on the tax benefits of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings loss net earnings  excluding the effect of merger related non recurring charges  was million for as compared to million for  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw  partially offset by the decline in the operating results of the americas owner and occupier services segment as discussed previously 
including the effect of the merger related non recurring charges  the net loss for was million compared to net earnings of million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue jones lang lasalle s total revenue  after elimination of intersegment revenue  grew million  or  to million in from million in increased revenues were driven  in part  by the acquisitions of compass  satulah and galbreath  as well as by the completion of the lho initial public offering 
in addition  growth was driven by strong capital flows into the us real estate market  in spite of a market correction which occurred during the latter half of  continued underlying demand for real estate by users across the spectrum of property types  and jones lang lasalle s ability to cross market real estate services to its clients 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in property management  leasing and investment management fees from four of jones lang lasalle s multiple investor funds commingled funds formed by jones lang lasalle in the s 
the decline is a result of the disposition of the funds assets  in accordance with the strategic plan 
these asset dispositions were completed by december revenue generated from these funds compared with total revenue was 
for and for operating expense jones lang lasalle s operating expenses  after elimination of intersegment expenses  increased million  or  to million in from million in operating expenses include million in merger related non recurring charges as a result of the compass acquisition and the merger with jlw 
jones lang lasalle s operating expenses  exclusive of these charges  totaled million and represented an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses  exclusive of the merger related charges  remained constant at approximately 
operating income as a result of the factors noted above  jones lang lasalle s operating income  including merger related non recurring charges of million  increased million  or  to million in from million in exclusive of the merger related charges  jones lang lasalle s operating income increased million  or 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating income  exclusive of merger related charges  remained constant at approximately 
segment operating results as a result of the merger with jlw in  jones lang lasalle changed the way it manages its business to a combination of functional and geographic lines 
segment operating results for and were realigned based upon these new business segments  however  for and the europe and asia pacific regions of the owner and occupier services segment were immaterial to jones lang lasalle as a whole and the hotel services segment was nonexistent 
consequently  the discussion below focuses on the americas segment of owner and occupier services and the investment management segment 
owner and occupier services americas revenue for the americas segment of owner and occupier services increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to five factors i the acquisitions of compass  satulah and galbreath  ii higher volumes of activity within the agency leasing  property management  tenant representation and capital markets business units  iii the addition of nine new corporate property services clients  iv new strategic alliance relationships formed by the project management and tenant representation businesses and v a higher volume of projects being managed by the development services business 
in addition  the growth in revenue experienced by the capital markets business includes incentive fees of million related to the initial public offering of lho 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue related to the sale of the commingled fund properties discussed previously  in addition to the volatility in the capital markets during the latter half of operating expenses for the americas region increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily a result of the effects of the compass  satulah and galbreath acquisitions  including personnel and facility costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from the acquisitions 
additionally  higher compensation and benefit costs associated with increased incentive compensation earned by the capital markets and tenant representation businesses  consistent with the increased levels of operating income generated contributed to the increase 
other contributing factors included increased staffing to support new business initiatives and incremental corporate infrastructure costs as a result of higher staffing levels and technology enhancements 
investment management investment management segment revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the net gain in revenue was primarily attributable to performance fees generated on the disposition of certain assets under management in which jones lang lasalle had a co investment  including certain hotel properties in connection with the formation of lho  and  to a lesser extent  to increased acquisition and advisory fees generated on international fund activity and a higher volume of activity performed by the securities business 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue related to the sale of the commingled fund properties discussed previously  in addition to the transition of approximately billion in assets under management related to the calpers portfolio to the client s new investment advisor during the third quarter of and the reduction in publicly traded reit values during the latter half of operating expenses for the jones lang lasalle investment management segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of increased incentive compensation  consistent with the increased level of operating income generated 
to a lesser extent  costs associated with new business initiatives contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset as a result of a one time reserve of million established in late related to the pending liquidation of a mid investment vehicle 
interest expense interest expense increased 
million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the compass acquisition and the resulting borrowings on the new acquisition facility and existing revolving credit facility 
this was partially offset by the repayment of jones lang lasalle s long term debt from the net proceeds of the offering and the subsequent repayment of outstanding debt under its working capital facility in july provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million in from million in as a result of jones lang lasalle s conversion from partnership to corporate form in july and the resulting provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of in and in this increase included the effects of the recognition of a million tax benefit in july  in accordance with sfas no 
 as a result of jones lang lasalle recording a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences between the book and tax basis of its consolidated assets and liabilities at the date of conversion to corporate form 
in  the provision for income taxes includes a tax benefit of approximately million related to merger related charges 
net earnings net earnings  including merger related charges of million on an after tax basis  decreased million  or  to million in from million in exclusive of merger related charges  net earnings increased slightly to million 
net earnings  excluding merger related charges  represented of total revenue compared to in this decrease primarily reflects the increased tax provision in as a result of being a taxable entity for the entire year  and to a lesser extent  the impact of amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources historically  jones lang lasalle has financed its operations  acquisitions and co investment activities with internally generated funds  the common stock of jones lang lasalle and borrowings under its credit facilities 
on october   jones lang lasalle closed a new million unsecured credit agreement that replaced the existing five year unsecured million revolving credit facility  the million term credit facility used to finance the compass acquisition and the million short term facility collectively the previous facilities 
the new agreement includes a million three year revolving facility and a million term facility due october  collectively  the new facilities 
the revolving facility is available for working capital  co investments and acquisitions 
jones lang lasalle is authorized under the agreement to increase the revolving facility up to a total of million and the term facility up to a total of million through the expansion of its existing bank group 
jones lang lasalle is in discussions with additional banks to increase the new facilities  however  there can be no guarantee as to the final outcome of these discussions 
as of december  there was million outstanding on the new facilities  of which million was classified as current 
the new facilities are guaranteed by certain of jones lang lasalle s subsidiaries 
jones lang lasalle must maintain a certain level of consolidated net worth and a ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
jones lang lasalle must also meet a minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum liquidity ratio  and minimum ebitda 
additionally  jones lang lasalle is restricted from  among other things  incurring certain levels of indebtedness to lenders outside of the new facilities  disposing of a significant portion of its assets  and paying dividends until the term facility is repaid 
lender approval is required for certain levels of co investment 
the new facilities bear variable rates of interest based on market rates 
jones lang lasalle uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the floating rate indebtedness to a fixed rate 
the effective interest rate on the previous facilities and the new facilities was for  including the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements had a notional amount as of december  of million 
jones lang lasalle has additional access to liquidity via various interest bearing overdraft facilities and short term credit facilities in europe and asia pacific 
the aggregate amount available under these facilities is approximately million  of which million was outstanding as of december  borrowings on these facilities are currently limited to million under the terms of the new facilities 
management believes that the new facilities  along with existing local borrowing facilities and cash flow generated from operations  will provide adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to meet working capital requirements  including merger and integration costs yet to be paid 
jones lang lasalle is exploring financing alternatives for the refinancing of the term facility due october   however  there can be no guarantee as to the final outcome of these discussions 
during  cash flows used in operating activities totaled million compared to cash flows provided by operations of million in the increased use is primarily a result of increased operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of compass and the merger with jlw  and the related payment of integration  transition and transaction costs associated with the transactions 
to a lesser extent  the increased use is due to higher bonus accruals at december  as compared to december   which are paid in the first quarter of the following year and higher trade receivables at december  as compared to december   primarily as a result of the compass acquisition and the jlw merger 
jones lang lasalle expects to continue to pursue co investment opportunities with investment management clients for which the holding period typically ranges from three to seven years 
while this program remains very important to the continued growth of the investment management segment  the future commitment to co investment is completely discretionary other than with respect to the million of commitments discussed below and can be increased or decreased based on the availability of capital and other factors 
the performance of the investment management segment would likely be negatively impacted if a substantial decrease in co investment were to occur 
management anticipates that co investment activity within the americas and europe regions will continue with probable expansion into asia pacific  as appropriate opportunities arise 
this strategy should serve to grow the assets under management  generate returns on investment and create potential opportunities to provide other services 
such co investments are generally represented by non controlling general partner  limited partner and limited liability company interests 
in addition to a share of investment returns  jones lang lasalle typically earns investment management fees  and in some cases  property management and leasing fees on these investments 
the equity earnings from these co investments have had a relatively small impact on current earnings and cash flow 
however  increased investment participation could increase fluctuations in net earnings and cash flow as a result of the timing and magnitude of the gains or losses and potential performance fees  if any  to be recognized upon the disposition of these assets 
in most of these investments  jones lang lasalle will not have complete discretion to control the timing of the disposition of such investments 
jones lang lasalle anticipates that a significant gain will be recorded in relating to the disposition of a large portfolio  which was delayed from closing in as of december   there were total investments of million in separate property or fund co investments with additional capital commitments of million for future fundings of co investments 
capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately million for these expenditures are associated primarily with the continual improvements to jones lang lasalle s information systems and computer hardware  including the implementation of global reporting and communication systems  office renewals and expansions and the scheduled replacement of fleet cars primarily within the european countries 
net cash used in investing activities was million for compared with million in the decreased use of cash of million is primarily attributable to the cash paid in relation to the acquisition of compass in and significant co investment activity in  including the investment in lasalle hotel properties 
these factors were partially offset by the cash paid in connection with the jlw merger and the increased capital expenditures during as a result of the jlw merger and acquisition of compass and the resulting consolidation of corporate offices 
the continued customization and implementation of the jd edwards property accounting and information system also offset these factors 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in was comprised primarily of proceeds from borrowings under credit facilities  net of repayments  of million for increased working capital requirements and to fund the payment of integration  transition and transaction costs associated with the compass acquisition and the jlw merger 
cash flows provided by financing activities of million in were composed of borrowings under credit facilities  net of repayments  of million to fund the acquisition of compass and infrastructure investments 
seasonality historically  jones lang lasalle s revenue  operating profits and net earnings in the first three calendar quarters are substantially lower than in the fourth quarter 
other than investment management  this seasonality is due to a calendar year end focus  primarily in the united states  on the completion of transactions  which is consistent with the real estate industry generally 
the investment management segment earns performance fees on clients returns on their real estate investments 
such performance fees are generally earned when the asset is disposed of  the timing of which jones lang lasalle does not have complete discretion over 
non variable operating expenses  which are treated as expenses when incurred during the year  are relatively constant on a quarterly basis
