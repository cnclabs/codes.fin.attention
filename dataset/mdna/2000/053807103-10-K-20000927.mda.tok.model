see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
unusual items as described below  the company has recorded a number of special charges during the last three fiscal years 
these charges relate primarily to the reorganization of em s operations in each of the three major regions of the world in which it operates and to the integration of newly acquired businesses 
management expects that the company s future results of operations will benefit from the expected cost savings resulting from these reorganizations and integration of new businesses  and that the impact on liquidity and sources and uses of capital will not be material 
during  the company recorded million pre tax million included in operating expenses and million included in cost of sales  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis of incremental special charges associated with the integration of acquired businesses into the company as described below million  the reorganization of em s european operating million  consisting primarily of costs related to the centralization of warehousing operations  the reorganization of em asian operating million and costs incurred in the second quarter in connection with its lawsuit against wyle laboratories  inc and certain individuals million

the costs incurred pertaining to the wyle lawsuit in which the company was the plaintiff related to legal and professional fees associated with the trial of the case  which commenced in september on february   a jury in tampa  florida returned a verdict in the case absolving the defendants of any liability

during  the company recorded special items which positively impacted income before income taxes  net income and diluted earnings per share by million  million and  respectively 
these special items consisted of the gain on the sale of the company s former allied electronics subsidiary million on july   the last day of fiscal  offset somewhat by charges recorded in connection with the disposition of the avnet setron catalog operation in germany  million and the reorganization of em million 
most of the charges related to the disposition of avnet setron involved the non cash write off of goodwill and the write down of inventory on product lines not typically sold by em s core businesses 
the company sold avnet setron in february for an amount approximately equal to its written down value 
the charges related to the reorganization of em are associated principally with em s european operations and included severance  inventory reserve required related to supplier terminations and other items 
the charge related to the reorganization of em also included some incremental costs associated with the completion of the reorganization of em americas  most of the cost for which were recorded in the fourth quarter of these costs included primarily employee relocation and special incentive payments as well as some additional severance costs 
of the million pre tax gain related to the special items recorded in  charges of million are included in operating expenses million requires the use of cash and million are included in the cost of sales all of which represented a non cash charge  and the million pre tax gain on the sale of allied electronics is shown separately in the company s consolidated statement of income 
the unusually large impact on taxes was a result of the elimination of goodwill attributable to the allied and setron businesses for which no tax benefit is available 
at june   the only cash remaining to be expended in connection with the special charge were amounts associated with long term real property lease terminations and contractual commitments  the amounts of which are not material

at june   the only cash remaining to be expended in connection with the special charge were amounts associated with long term real property lease termination and contractual commitments  the amounts of which are not material 
operating income consolidated gross profit margins before special charges were in as compared with and in and  respectively 
this downward trend is due primarily to the competitive environment in the electronic distribution marketplace as a result of the global industry cyclical downtrend as well as the effect of increased sales of computer products including microprocessors  drams  disk drives  etc  which have lower gross profit margins than other products in the company s product lines 
after reaching a low point of approximately in the first and second quarter of  consolidated gross profit margin began increasing and reached in the fourth quarter of evidencing that the electronics distribution industry has begun to rebound from the longest cyclical downtrend in its history 
although operating expenses before special charges in absolute dollars were sequentially higher during the last three years  they fell to a record low of as a percentage of sales during as compared with in both and comparative operating expenses in versus were negatively impacted by approximately million of incremental costs associated with the company s year remediation program see below  the extra week of expenses due to the company s week fiscal calendar and by normal operating expenses incurred by newly acquired businesses 
as noted above  the company s operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the entire year reached a record low of in due in part to the company s highly successful integration of marshall industries into its em americas operations 
the impact of the synergy benefits was more evident in the fourth quarter of as operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell to record low of in that quarter 
the combination of improving industry conditions and the synergy benefits derived from recent acquisitions resulted in a fourth quarter operating income margin of  the first time operating income margins have exceeded since the third quarter of operating income before special charges of million in represented of sales  as compared with million or of sales in and million or of sales in interest expense and net income interest expense was million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the significant increase in interest expense during the last few years was due primarily to increased borrowings to fund the company s acquisition program  its stock repurchase program and the additional working capital requirements to support the growth in business 
interest expense in was also impacted by increased interest rates as a result of the federal reserve s actions to increase short term rates and the company s decision to issue in february million of notes due as a result of the factors described above  consolidated net income excluding all special items in was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with million  or per share on a diluted basis  in and million  or per share on a diluted basis  in including the special items referred to above  net income in was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in and million  or per share on a diluted basis in net income before special items as a percentage of sales was in as compared with and in and  respectively 
as the company has increased its investment in foreign operations  the financial statement impact associated with the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates has become more apparent 
the translation into us dollars of the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in a charge recorded directly to shareholders equity amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the euro and its associated currencies against the us dollar 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of british and french currencies against the dollar  and the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  canadian and far east currencies against the us dollar 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the statement of income was not material due to the fact that avnet s international operations represent only of sales and a smaller percentage of income 
had the various average foreign currency exchange rates remained the same during as compared with  avnet s consolidated sales and net income would have been less than and  respectively  higher than the actual reported results for liquidity and capital resources over the last three years  cash generated from income before depreciation  amortization  the pre tax gain on the dispositions of allied electronics and channel master  and other non cash items amounted to million 
during that period  million was used for working capital needs excluding cash resulting in million of net cash flows used for operations 
in addition  million  net  was needed for other normal business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other items million 
this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
during that three year period  the company also used million  net  for the repurchase of its common stock million and the net cash used for acquisitions of operations in excess of the cash provided from dispositions million  offset somewhat by cash generated from other debt million 
this overall use of cash of billion was financed by the billion raised from the issuance of commercial paper  the issuance in february of the notes due  the issuance in august of the notes due and an increase in bank debt  offset by a million addition to cash and cash equivalents 
in  the company generated million from income before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  and used million for working capital needs  resulting in million of net cash flows being used for operating activities

this resulted in million being used for normal business operations

this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
the company also used million to repurchase its common stock and generated million from its disposition of allied electronics  net of cash used for acquisitions  and the issuance of other debt

the company s quick assets at june  totaled billion as compared with billion at july at june   quick assets exceeded the company s current liabilities by million as compared with million excess at the end of working capital at june  was billion as compared with billion at july  at june  to support each dollar of current liabilities  the company had of quick assets and of other current assets  for a total of as compared with at the end of the prior fiscal year 
however  the above balance sheet amounts at july  were significantly impacted by the million of cash received on that day in connection with the sale of allied electronics 
on july   cash and cash equivalents included million of before tax proceeds from the sale of allied electronics with the balance of the cash received at closing having been used to reduce commercial paper outstanding 
in addition  current liabilities at july  included approximately million of accrued income taxes payable as a result of the gain on the sale of allied electronics 
as indicated below  during the company entered into a million syndicated credit facility  which at june  was used to back up a portion of its outstanding commercial paper 
this short term borrowing was the principal reason for the decline in the working capital ratio and the decrease in the quick ratio indicated above 
these borrowings also contributed to an increase in the company s debt to capital ratio at june  the company is evaluating its capital structure and may  if deemed appropriate  issue equity or equity linked securities 
in order to partially finance the cash component of the acquisition of marshall industries as described below and to provide additional working capital capacity  the company entered into a million day credit facility in october with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america 
the company may select from various interest rate options and maturities under this facility  although the company intends to utilize the facility primarily as a back up for its commercial paper program pursuant to which the company is authorized to issue short term notes for current operational business requirements 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  none of which management believes materially limit the company s financial flexibility to pursue its intended business strategy 
on february   the company issued million of notes due february  the notes 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and other expenses associated with the sale of the notes 
in august  the company issued million of notes due august  the notes 
the net proceeds received by the company from the sale of the notes were approximately million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and other expenses associated with the sale of the notes 
the net proceeds from the notes and the notes have been used to repay indebtedness which the company may re borrow for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  acquisitions  repurchase of the company s common stock and working capital needs 
in june  the company entered into separate credit agreements with banca commerciale italiana and unicredito italiano 
the agreements provide eighteen month facilities with lines of credit totaling billion italian lira us dollar equivalent of approximately million 
the facilities are currently being used primarily as a source of working capital financing for one of the company s italian subsidiaries 
in addition  in september  the company entered into an agreement with kbc  a belgian bank  to finance the construction of the new avnet europe  nv sa distribution center in tongeren  belgium

the company also has a five year facility with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america which expires in september and which provides a line of credit of up to million 
the company may select from various interest rate options and maturities under this facility 
this credit facility serves as a primary funding vehicle as well as a backup for the company s commercial paper program 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  none of which management believes materially limit the company s financial flexibility to pursue its intended financial strategy 
during the last three years  the company s shareholders equity increased by million to billion at june   while total debt increased by billion to billion 
the increase in shareholders equity during that three year period was the net result of the positive impact of net income million  shares issued in connection with the acquisitions of marshall industries and sei eurotronics million and other items  net  principally related to stock option and incentive programs million  offset by the repurchase of common stock million  dividends million and cumulative translation adjustments million 
the company s debt to capital shareholders equity plus total debt ratio was approximately at june  and at july  the company s favorable balance sheet ratios would facilitate additional financing  if  in the opinion of management  such financing would enhance the future operations of the company 
currently  the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company and the former owners of a company owned site in oxford  north carolina have entered into a consent decree and court order with the environmental protection agency epa for the environmental clean up of the site  the cost of which  according to the epa s remedial investigation and feasibility study  is estimated to be approximately million  exclusive of the million in epa past costs paid by the potentially responsible parties prp s 
pursuant to a consent decree and court order entered into between the company and the former owners of the site  the former owners have agreed to bear at least of the clean up costs of the site  and the company will be responsible for not more than of those costs 
in addition  the company has become aware of claims that may be made against it and or its sterling electronics corp 
subsidiary  which was acquired as part of the acquisition of marshall industries 
sterling once owned of the capital stock of phaostron  inc in august  sterling sold the interest in phaostron to westbase  inc at the time of the sale  sterling and westbase entered into an agreement related to environmental costs resulting from alleged contamination at a facility leased by phaostron that is a part of the san gabriel valley superfund site 
the agreement provided that sterling would pay up to  for environmental costs associated with the site 
the company does not believe that sterling or the company will be responsible for environmental costs in excess of  and has established what it believes to be adequate reserves for any share of such costs that may be borne by sterling or the company 
in addition  the company has received notice from a third party of its intention to seek indemnification for costs it may incur in connection with an environmental clean up at a site in rush  pennsylvania resulting from the alleged disposal of wire insulation material at the site by a former unit of the company 
based upon the information known to date  management believes that the company has appropriately accrued in its financial statements for its share of the costs of the clean ups with respect to the above mentioned sites 
the company is also a defendant in a lawsuit brought against it at an environmental clean up site in huguenot  new york 
at this time  management cannot estimate the amount of the company s potential liability  if any  for clean up costs in connection with this site  but does not anticipate that this matter or any other contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
management is not now aware of any commitments  contingencies or events within the company s control which may significantly change its ability to generate sufficient cash from internal or external sources to meet its needs

to capitalize on growing world markets for electronic components and computer products  the company has pursued and expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its business 
management believes that the company has the ability to generate sufficient capital resources from internal or external sources in order to continue its expansion program 
in addition  as with past acquisitions  management does not expect that future acquisitions will materially impact the company s liquidity 
market risks many of the company s operations  primarily its international subsidiaries  occasionally purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the market risk related to the foreign exchange contracts is offset by the changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the amount of risk and the use of derivative financial instruments described above is not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as of september   approximately of the company s outstanding debt was in fixed rate instruments and was subject to variable short term interest rates 
accordingly  the company will be impacted by any change in short term interest rates

the euro effective on january   a single european currency the euro was introduced and certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing national currencies and the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date  and during the transition period through january  either the euro or a participating country s national currency will be accepted as legal currency 
the company is addressing the issues raised by the introduction of the euro including  among other things  the potential impact on its internal systems  tax and accounting considerations  business issues and foreign exchange rate risks 
although management is still evaluating the impact of the euro  management does not anticipate  based upon information currently available  that the introduction of the euro will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
