domestic metalcasting sales increased in  offsetting sales declines to domestic well drilling and export customers 
as a result of the cat litter acquisition made in late  the uk mineral operation produced an operating loss of approximately million 
the company experienced problems in management  customer service and production  along with construction delays in integrating the acquisition into the existing plant and organization

forward looking statements certain statements made from time to time by the company  including statements in the management s discussion and analysis section above  constitute forward looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor contained in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include statements relating to the company or its operations that are preceded by terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends and similar expressions  and statements relating to anticipated growth  levels of capital expenditures  future dividends  expansion into global markets and the development of new products 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation the following pending transaction risk the company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its superabsorbent polymer business to basf ag 
completion of the transaction is subject to the mechanical completion of the polymer plant in thailand  approval by regulatory authorities in the united states  united kingdom and germany  and approval by the company s shareholders 
growth rate of absorbent polymer operations a significant part of our growth in sales and profit during the last five years has come from sales of superabsorbent polymers sap 
our sales of sap have increased in part because newer diaper designs use larger amounts of sap and because of growth in our sales to international markets 
our ability to continue this growth depends on several factors  including the following o our ability to retain key clients  o the continued use of larger amounts of sap in new diaper designs  o the continued growth in sales to international markets  o growth in sales to manufacturers of brand name products  and o acceptance of new applications for sap which we have developed 
there can be no assurance that our sales of sap will continue to grow in the future or remain at current levels 
dependence on large absorbent polymer customers our two largest absorbent polymer customers accounted for approximately of our absorbent polymer sales in and our five largest absorbent polymer customers accounted for approximately of such sales 
we do not usually enter into long term contracts with our absorbent polymer customers 
these customers generally have the right to terminate their relationship with us with little or no notice 
we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current level of sales to our five largest absorbent polymer customers or any other customer in the future 
many diaper manufacturers  including some of our customers  frequently change their diaper designs 
during this process  many diaper manufacturers review the types of sap available to determine the type of sap best suited for their new diaper design 
some customers may elect to use the sap of one of our competitors 
the termination of our relationship with any of our significant absorbent polymer customers  or a material reduction in the sap sold to such customers  could adversely affect our business and future financial results 
competition absorbent polymers 
the absorbent polymers market is very competitive 
our us operations compete with approximately four manufacturers and at least three importers 
our uk operations compete with numerous manufacturers 
two of our competitors have more production capability and several producers have greater resources 
in addition  several of our competitors also produce acrylic acid  which is the primary cost component of sap 
the cost of acrylic acid to these competitors may be significantly less than the price we pay for acrylic acid 
we believe competition in our absorbent polymers segment is primarily a matter of product quality and price 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to attract new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
minerals 
the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the us market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
technology we believe our success and ability to compete in the absorbent polymers segment depends  to a large extent  on our proprietary production process 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  trademark  and other intellectual property laws to protect this proprietary technology 
however  we may have difficulty monitoring the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and the steps we have taken to protect it may not be adequate 
any misappropriation of our proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or future financial results 
in addition  if any of our competitors become able to produce a more effective or cheaper sap  demand for our sap products may decrease or be eliminated 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products by the metalcasting and construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results may be adversely affected in the minerals and environmental segments  respectively 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become difficult or expensive for us to comply 
in addition  investigations or evaluations of our products by government agencies may require us to adopt additional safety measures or precautions 
if our costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future materially increase  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
the company may be subject to adverse litigation results as well as future changes in laws and regulations that may negatively impact its operations and profits 
availability of raw materials acrylic acid is our primary cost component in manufacturing sap 
acrylic acid is only available from a limited number of suppliers 
if we become unable to obtain a sufficient supply of sap at a reasonable price  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally 
we intend to seek acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances globally 
currently  our business outside the united states represents approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  africa along with the middle east  and other 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks which may include the following o currency exchange or price control laws  o currency translation adjustments  o political and economic instability  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and o adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand for the company s products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
at december   approximately of the gross accounts receivable were due from customers outside of the united states and canada 
the breakdown of the overseas balance was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa and the middle east 
volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock o fluctuations in our financial results  o our introduction of new services or products  o announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  o changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and o general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world  the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency  interest rates and government actions 
the company uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity the company is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the mexican peso  the thai baht and the korean won 
the company also has significant exposure to changes in exchange rates between the british pound and the euro 
the company s various currency exposures often offset each other  providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
periodically  specific foreign currency transactions eg inventory purchases  royalty payments  etc 
are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges are included in the basis of the underlying hedged transactions 
as of december   the company had outstanding foreign currency contracts to sell the equivalent of million of british pounds to hedge raw material purchases 
the fair value of these agreements results in an immaterial unrecognized loss at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt obligations 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are denominated in both us dollars us  british pounds bp  norwegian kroner nok  korean won won and thai baht thb as indicated in parentheses

these instruments allow the company to exchange variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate 
interest rate differentials paid or received on these arrangements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of the agreements 
at december   the company had one interest rate swap outstanding  which expires in september  in a notional amount of million 
the fair value of this agreement results in an unrecognized loss at december   of the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
the credit risk associated with cash equivalents and short term investments is mitigated by the company s policy of investing in securities with high credit ratings and investing through major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company currently believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
the company s accounts receivable financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair value 
commodity price sensitivity acrylic acid is the most significant cost component in the production of sap 
the company purchases a significant amount of acrylic acid under long term contracts 
the terms of these contracts include a linkage to the cost of propylene 
the company has not hedged against fluctuations in the cost of propylene
