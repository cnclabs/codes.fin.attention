item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the design  development and commercialization of the prs system  a proprietary  therapeutic device for the treatment of cancerous tumors through the application of radiation directly into a tumor 
to date  the company has not received any significant revenue from the sale of its current prs system model 
the company has experienced significant operating losses in each year since its inception  due primarily to substantial research and development expenditures 
as of january   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and expects to continue to incur losses until such time as its commercialization efforts yield offsetting revenues 
there can be no assurance that the prs system will ever gain commercial acceptance  or that the company will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations will be dependent in a large part on whether it can successfully commercialize the prs  accubeam and intrabeam systems and make the transition to a manufacturing and marketing company 
the company anticipates that its sales and marketing efforts with carl zeiss will begin to generate sales of the prs  accubeam and intrabeam systems in the upcoming year 
the company anticipates that its research and development  sales and general and administrative expenses will increase minimally during the company does not expect to be able to generate sufficient revenue in the next year to support the continuing operations of the organization and will need to raise the necessary capital to offset this short fall 
should the necessary funds not be available to the company on acceptable terms  there is substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
the company obtained a section k marketing clearance for the prs system on july   which the company developed for introduction as its first commercial product 
simultaneous with completion of prs system product development  the company completed the implementation of programs designed to ensure compliance with the fda s cgmp standards 
the company also completed the process of seeking certification to the medical device directive annex ii  enabling self certification of the european community mark ce 
on december   the company initiated commercial distribution of the prs system 
in september  the company obtained a section k marketing clearance from the fda to market the system for radiotherapy treatments  regardless of treatment site 
in august  the company entered into a strategic alliance with carl zeiss  an international technology leader whose medical systems division specializes in high technology equipment such as surgical microscopes for various medical disciplines and state of the art image guided surgery equipment 
the company appointed carl zeiss as its exclusive distributor for the prs system throughout the world except for japan where toshiba medical systems is the company s distributor of the prs system for intracranial applications and spinal radiotherapy and as its non exclusive distributor for the prs system in the same territory for all other clinical applications 
in addition  carl zeiss agreed to assist the company in the development of new intraoperative radiotherapy products and to provide service and support for the company s products 
the alliance with carl zeiss gives the company access to a global sales force with an established record of sales of high technology equipment within the medical field 
in november  the company announced the launch of two products jointly developed with carl zeiss i the accubeam system  a device for the treatment of brain tumors that combines the company s miniature x ray source with carl zeiss s stereotactic guided  motorized mkm surgical microscope system  and ii the intrabeam system  a multi purpose system for intraoperative radiotherapy that combines the company s miniature x ray source with an articulated support stand from carl zeiss 
in addition to establishing its strategic alliance with carl zeiss  the company joined the snn  a consortium of medical equipment companies that has established a shared  open standard  image based software system to support their products 
by participating in the snn consortium and utilizing its software system  the company can integrate its miniature x ray source with the products of other snn members  including philips  agfa impax  aesculap and xltek 
in addition  the snn participants agree to promote each other s products on a non exclusive basis  thus enhancing the company s distribution capabilities 
the software used by snn is written and supported by sns 
sns is currently working to integrate the company s technology into the software platform shared by the other snn member companies 
on december   the company and toshiba entered into an agreement pursuant to which toshiba is helping to develop and support clinical trials of the prs system in japan 
the development and support of the clinical trials included purchasing two complete systems of the prs system for use in the clinical trials  installing and maintaining the prs system  and providing assistance to the physicians and hospitals conducting the trials  including collection and analysis of clinical data 
the company and toshiba expect to submit to the japan ministry of health an application for product approval shonin of the prs system in the first quarter of fiscal the company and toshiba expect to obtain product approval shonin in japan for the prs system in the second half of once regulatory approvals for the prs system are obtained in japan  toshiba will serve as the company s exclusive distributor in japan

liquidity and capital resources the company has expended substantial funds to research and develop the prs  accubeam and intrabeam systems and other potential products  conduct clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals  establish commercial scale manufacturing in its own facilities or in the facilities of others  and market the prs  accubeam and intrabeam systems 
the company anticipates it will continue to expend substantial funds in the future on such activities as such funds become available 
since its inception  the company has financed its operations through the issuance of convertible debt and equity in a series of private placements totaling approximately million 
on february   the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  including the underwriters overallotment option  at a price of per share

the company believes that these policies cover such risks in such amounts as are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances  and the company does not anticipate that claims under these policies  if any  will have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity or capital resources 
prior to commercial sale of its products  the company obtained product liability insurance covering the commercial use of its products 
during  the company concluded settlement discussions with a physician and his employer 
the company had been notified that such physician and his employer believed that they had certain rights with regard to their understanding of the company s planned use of the prs system for treatment of tumors in body cavities 
no formal legal proceedings were initiated and the company reached an agreement with the parties as to settlement of the matter 
the settlement of the matter did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors  including the time and costs involved in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the results of the company s ongoing clinical trials  the market acceptance of the prs  accubeam and intrabeam systems and any other company products  the expense and results of the company s continued scientific research and development programs  the time and costs expended in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  and the development of competing technologies 
as of january   the company estimates that its available cash and cash equivalents  bridge financing from pyc corporation and together with the start of revenues in early  from product sales  will allow the company to continue operations for approximately three to four months  and that it therefore will be necessary for the company to raise additional capital in the immediate future 
any additional equity financings will be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
no assurance can be given that the necessary funds will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all 
should the company be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  there is substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as a going concern
