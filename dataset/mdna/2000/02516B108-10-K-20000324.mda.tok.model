the company s shoppes are placed in retail accounts and similar high traffic locations and the company typically pays of gross revenue to the location owner as a location commission 
the company has also introduced new types of complementary vending and amusement machines at existing shoppe locations 
at december   the company was operating in states with a national network of offices and there were company franchisees operating in territories in the united states and one territory in british columbia 
the company sells both machines and product vended in the machines to its franchisees and collects continuing royalties ranging from to of its franchisees gross machine revenue 
for the year ended december   over of the company s revenue and gross profit were derived from company owned shoppes 
the company s revenue and gross profit in a particular period is directly related to the number of shoppes in operation during the period 
management believes that the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with average revenue per machine per week historically higher during the easter and christmas periods 
vending revenue represents cash receipts from customers using vending machines and is recognized when collected 
the cost of vending revenue is comprised of the cost of vended products  location commissions  depreciation and direct service cost 
franchise and other revenue represents the company s percentage of gross vending revenue generated by shoppes owned and operated by franchisees  as well as product sold to the franchisees and non franchisee customers 
product sold to the franchisees and non franchisee customers consists of goods to vend in shoppes 
equipment sales to the franchisees have been done on a pass through basis from the company s main suppliers

in  the decline in vending margin also resulted from a higher average shoppe commission rate paid to locations 
during the third quarter of  the company found it necessary to handle its own plush product warehousing in the seattle area due to increased product requirements and insufficient space available at the public warehouse previously used by the company

net earnings and earnings per share net earnings for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenue  as compared to net earnings of million  or of total revenue  during diluted earnings per share for decreased to  as compared to per share in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been cash flows from operations  borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and issuances of its equity securities 
these sources of cash flows have been offset by cash used for acquisitions  investment in skill crane machines and other amusement devices and payment of long term borrowings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that cash will continue to be provided by operations as additional skill crane machines and other amusement devices are placed in service 
cash required in the future is expected to be funded by existing cash and cash provided by operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  of which million  million and million were used for the acquisition of amusement vending skill machines 
the acquisition of franchisees and others used  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  activities consisted primarily of borrowings on the credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
in  activities consisted primarily borrowings on the credit facility and the issuance of trust preferred securities that provided million 
in the issuance of common stock primarily in connection with the company s follow on offering  provided million 
under its current credit facility  the company may borrow up to million  less an interest reserve of  at a rate based on the bank s prime interest rate or  at the company s option  an interest rate based on the current libor rate 
the interest reserve will be reduced quarterly  as interest payments are made on the trust preferred securities 
the effective rate at december  was 
the credit facility is available through july  and at december  there was a principal amount of approximately million outstanding and million available under the facility 
the credit facility provides that certain financial ratios be met and places restrictions on  among other things  the occurrence of additional debt financing and the payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with such financial ratios and restrictions at december  the company may use a portion of its capital resources to effect acquisitions of franchisees 
because the company cannot predict the timing or nature of acquisition opportunities  or the availability of acquisition financing  the company cannot determine the extent to which capital resources may be used 
company management believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings available under its credit facility and the company s ability to negotiate additional and enhanced credit agreements will be sufficient to meet the company s foreseeable operating and capital expenditure needs 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements 
because such statements include risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in the sections entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
shoppe performance 
a primary key to the financial success of the company is the weekly revenue generated per shoppe  which has a history of fluctuating 
the company has attributed some of this fluctuation to the effectiveness of its product mix and has taken steps to address this problem  however  there can be no assurance that such efforts will continue to have a positive impact on the performance of the shoppes 
the average weekly revenue generated per shoppe may decline or fluctuate in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
growth and management of growth 
the company has recently experienced substantial growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow at historical rates or at all 
the company s ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability will depend upon its ability and the ability of its franchisees to place additional shoppes in retail accounts as well as to maintain or increase the average financial performance of the shoppes 
the company s ability to place additional shoppes depends on a number of factors beyond the company s control  including general business and economic conditions 
installation of additional shoppes will also depend  in part  upon the company s ability to secure additional national and regional retail accounts and to obtain approval to place additional shoppes in individual locations of such accounts 
the company  its franchisees and their suppliers also may be unable to place and adequately service additional shoppes  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its expanding operations effectively or that it will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth 
the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of the company s business  including shoppe servicing  merchandising  financial and administrative personnel and systems 
the company s future operating results are substantially dependent upon the ability of the company s officers and key personnel to manage anticipated growth and increased demand effectively  to attract  train and retain additional qualified personnel  and to implement and improve technical  service  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
either deterioration in shoppe performance or the company s failure to manage growth effectively could adversely and materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial indebtedness  effect of financial leverage 
the company intends to use funds available under the credit facility million at december  for a number of purposes  including future acquisitions of franchisees 
further use of funds from the credit facility could result in the company incurring additional indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its stockholders equity and cash flow 
as a result of the issuance of the ascending rate cumulative trust preferred securities and the amount the company owes pursuant to the credit facility  fixed charges could exceed earnings for the foreseeable future 
substantial leverage poses the risk that the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its indebtedness  or to adequately fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its revenue and leverage the acquisitions it has made to achieve sufficient cash flow to meet its potential debt service obligations 
in particular  there can be no assurance that the company s operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its debt service obligations under the credit facility 
the company s leverage also could limit its ability to effect future financings or may otherwise restrict the company s operations and growth 
trade relations and dependence on major accounts 
the company s largest account  wal mart  accounted for approximately of total revenue in the company is currently negotiating a new contract with wal mart to replace the previous contract 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining a new wal mart contract 
the loss of the wal mart account  or the loss of a significant number of other major accounts  or a significant reduction in the number of shoppes placed at such accounts  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the company competes with a number of regional and local operators of skill crane machines 
many of these competitors are engaged in aggressive expansion programs  and the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience intense competition for new locations and acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future 
the company s shoppes also compete with other vending machines  coin operated amusement devices  coin counting and redemption machines and seasonal and bulk merchandise for sites within retail locations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current sites in the retail locations or that it will be able to obtain sites in the future on attractive terms or at all 
there also are few barriers to entry in the company s business  and it would be possible for well financed vending machine manufacturers or other vending machine operators with existing relationships with retail accounts targeted by the company to compete readily with the company in certain markets 
dependence on suppliers and foreign sourcing 
substantially all of the plush toys and other products dispensed from the shoppes are produced by foreign manufacturers 
a majority are purchased directly by the company from manufacturers in china 
the company purchases its other products indirectly from vendors who obtain a significant percentage of such products from foreign manufacturers 
as a result  the company is subject to changes in governmental policies  the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions and labor strikes that could disrupt the supply of products from such manufacturers 
among other things  the loss of china s most favored nation status under us tariff laws could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of certain products manufactured in china  which could result in substantially increased costs for certain products purchased by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also could be affected by labor strikes in the sea shipping  trucking and railroad industries  all of which the company utilizes to varying degrees 
although the company believes that alternative means of transportation would be available for its products in the event of a labor strike affecting a particular mode of transportation  such a disruption could increase the company s transportation costs and thereby reduce its profit margins in a particular period 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its crane suppliers 
while the company believes that it will continue to be able to purchase skill crane machines from existing or alternative suppliers  no assurance can be given that skill cranes will be available on a cost efficient basis or that shortages or other disruptions in the company s sources of supply for skill crane machines and components would not have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality and variability of results 
the financial performance of the shoppes is substantially dependent on the level of retail traffic at such shoppes particular location 
accordingly  the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company can be materially and adversely affected by factors that reduce retail traffic at shoppe locations 
these include numerous factors beyond the company s control such as weather  labor strikes and other disruptions of the business at retail accounts and local and national business and economic conditions 
the company s results are also linked to seasonal increases in foot traffic at retail accounts  and disruptions of past trends  including traditional increases during holiday seasons  could decrease the company s revenue 
as a result  the company s operating results may vary significantly over time 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and the company s past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
changing consumer trends  technological innovations 
consumer preferences are constantly changing and difficult to predict  and consumer interest in the company s shoppes or the products dispensed could decline suddenly or other prize dispensing equipment or amusement devices could replace the shoppes in consumer preference 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to offer new and appealing products and on the continuing appeal of its shoppes skill crane format in both existing markets and in new markets into which the company may expand 
there can be no assurance that the use of skill crane machines and the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by changing consumer trends 
the company s business also is susceptible to advances in the design and manufacture of skill crane machines and other vending technology 
the company s failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such technological changes could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key employees 
the company s success to date has been dependent in part upon the efforts and abilities of randall j 
fagundo its chief executive officer and president  w 
john cash its senior vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  robert a 
kaslon its senior vice president of merchandising and certain other key personnel 
the company s continued success will depend upon its ability to retain a number of its current key employees and to attract  train and retain new key management and operational personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing key employees or attract and retain qualified employees in the future 
the company does not maintain any key man insurance 
in addition  executives or other employees with knowledge of the company s operations and policies may leave the company and establish competitive businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to effectively enforce non compete provisions against these individuals
