item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment ensco international incorporated ensco or the company is one of the leading international providers of offshore drilling and marine transportation services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s operations are concentrated in the geographic regions of north america  europe  asia pacific and south america 
demand for the company s services is significantly affected by worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
expenditures for oil and gas drilling activity fluctuate based upon many factors including world economic conditions  the legislative environment in the us and other major countries  production levels and other activities of opec and other oil and gas producers  and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
concern over excess oil supplies adversely impacted oil prices during and early as a result of the decrease in oil prices  oil companies curtailed or deferred exploration and development spending  which adversely impacted industry conditions during oil prices have been increasing since early  and recently prices for west texas intermediate crude oil have exceeded per barrel 
the increase in oil prices is due primarily to cutbacks in oil production by opec and to a more favorable outlook for worldwide oil demand 
whether or not the recent increase in oil prices will be sustained is not determinable at the present time 
although higher oil prices improves the likelihood of oil companies increasing their exploration and development spending  the timing of any exploration and development spending increase and the impact on the company s operations and financial results are uncertain 
the recent improvement in oil prices and us natural gas prices has increased demand for drilling rigs and marine vessels in domestic markets  and the company began experiencing increases in domestic day rates and utilization during the fourth quarter of however  an increase in demand for drilling rigs in international markets appears to be lagging the domestic markets  and the company does not expect improvement in international markets until later in results of operations the company s results reflect the impact of the industry downturn that began in the company s average day rates and utilization in were substantially lower than those achieved in and the following table highlights the company s consolidated operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december  in millions operating results revenues

discussions relative to each of the company s operating segments and geographic operations are set forth below 
contract drilling 
the following is an analysis of the geographic locations of the company s offshore drilling rigs at december   and jackup rigs north america europe asia pacific total jackup rigs barge rigs south america platform rigs total the company sold four barge rigs in october and completed construction of three new barge rigs that were added to the company s fleet during the first and second quarters of in april  the company completed the operating contract for a platform rig that was located off the coast of china 
the platform rig was not owned by the company  but operated under a management contract 
the company s seven remaining platform rigs are all located in the gulf of mexico 
in  revenues for the contract drilling segment decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily due to a decrease in the average day rates of the company s jackup rigs and a decrease in the utilization of the company s drilling rig fleet  to in from in operating expenses for the contract drilling segment decreased million  or  from the prior year due to reduced utilization and the impact of cost savings measures  which included  among other things  reductions in personnel and decreases in performance based compensation and benefits 
in  revenues for the contract drilling segment increased by million  or  while operating margin decreased by million  or  from the increase in revenues is due primarily to a increase in average day rates for the company s jackup rigs  and a increase in average day rates for the company s platform rigs 
in addition  the acquisition of the ensco jackup rig  in december  increased revenues by million in these increases were offset in part by a decrease in utilization for the company s jackup rigs  to in from in  and the sale of four barge rigs in venezuela in october the contract drilling operating margin was negatively impacted by an million  or  increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to higher wages and benefits and increased oilfield equipment and materials costs 
north america jackup rigs in  revenues for the north america jackup rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to a decrease in average day rates in operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to cost savings measures 
in  revenues for the north america jackup rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is due primarily to an approximate decrease in average day rates and a decrease in utilization to in from in in addition to the decrease in revenues  operating margin was negatively impacted by a million increase in operating expenses in  due primarily to higher wages and benefits and increased oilfield equipment and materials costs 
europe jackup rigs in  revenues for the europe jackup rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to a decline in average day rates and to a decrease in utilization  to in from in operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to cost savings measures and substantially lower utilization 
in  revenues for the europe jackup rigs increased by million  or  and operating margin increased by million  or  as compared to the increase in revenues and operating margin is due primarily to a increase in average day rates in as compared to and the addition of the ensco jackup rig  in december  which added revenues of million in these increases in revenues were offset in part by a decrease in utilization to in as compared to in operating margin was negatively impacted by a million increase in operating expenses in  due primarily to higher wages and benefits and increased oilfield equipment and materials costs 
asia pacific jackup rigs in  revenues for the asia pacific jackup rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to a decline in average day rates and to a decrease in utilization  to in from in operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to cost savings measures and lower utilization 
in  revenues for the asia pacific jackup rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by 
million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues is due primarily to a decrease in utilization  to in as compared to in  offset in part by a increase in average day rates 
the decrease in utilization is due to shipyard downtime and additional idle time resulting from the slowdown in drilling activity in southeast asia 
south america barge rigs in  revenues for the south america barge rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to reduced utilization 
four of the ten barge rigs that operated during the prior year were sold in october  and the remaining six barge rigs were idle for the majority of after experiencing early contract terminations in january the decrease in revenues and operating margin attributable to these ten barge rigs was partially offset by the operating results of three newly constructed barge rigs that commenced operations in march  april and june of  and by lump sum early contract termination payments totaling million in january operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year  as cost reductions attributable to cost savings measures  the four barge rigs sold in october and the reduced utilization of the remaining six barge rigs that operated during the prior year were only partially offset by the costs associated with the three newly constructed barge rigs 
in  revenues for the south america barge rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is due primarily to the sale of four barge rigs in october whose initial contract periods expired during the second quarter of in october  the company sold four barge rigs to petroleos de venezuela pdvsa in connection with contractual purchase options exercised by pdvsa 
at the date of sale  the company received cash proceeds of million  and the company and pdvsa reached a reservation of rights agreement for the resolution of certain contractual disputes relating to additional consideration the company believed it was entitled to receive in connection with the sale 
based on the cash proceeds received  the company recognized an insignificant gain in the fourth quarter of after taxes and a required payment of million to ensco s minority interest holder 
in december  the company reached a settlement with pdvsa for additional consideration and recognized a gain of million  or approximately million net after taxes and minority interest see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
platform rigs in  revenues from the platform rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to a decline in average day rates and to a decrease in utilization  to in from in operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to cost savings measures and lower utilization 
in  revenues for the platform rigs increased by million  or  and operating margin increased by million  or  as compared to the increase in revenues is due to an increase in utilization  to in from in  and a increase in day rates 
the increase in utilization is due primarily to less shipyard downtime in as compared to and reduced idle time due to increased demand 
operating margin was negatively impacted by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to the additional operating days in marine transportation 
at december   the company had a marine transportation fleet of vessels  consisting of six anchor handling tug supply ahts vessels  supply vessels and six mini supply vessels 
three of these vessels  including one ahts vessel and two mini supply vessels  were sold during the first quarter of the company also sold two mini supply vessels during the fourth quarter of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  the company added a foot   horsepower ahts vessel to its fleet 
the ahts vessel is being leased  and the company has an option to purchase the vessel beginning february in september  one of the company s large ahts vessels sank while supporting drilling operations for a customer in the gulf of mexico 
the vessel was fully insured and the company recognized a gain on the loss of the vessel see other income expense and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
all of the company s marine transportation vessels are located in the gulf of mexico 
in  revenues for the marine transportation segment decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily attributable to a decline in average day rates and to a decrease in utilization  to in from in operating expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to cost savings measures and lower utilization 
in  revenues for the marine transportation segment decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is due primarily to a decrease in utilization  to in from in  and a decrease in average day rates 
in addition  revenues decreased due to the loss of a vessel in september operating expenses increased million  or  due primarily to increased drydocking expense and higher personnel costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense in increased million  or  as compared to the increase is due primarily to rig enhancement projects that were completed in and construction of the three new barge rigs that commenced operations in  offset in part by the sale of four barge rigs in october in  depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million  or  due primarily to a change in the estimated useful lives of the company s drilling rigs and marine vessels effective january  based on an engineering and economic study of the company s asset base completed in the fourth quarter of  the depreciable lives of the company s drilling rigs and marine vessels were extended by an average of five to six years 
the effect of this change on the company s financial results for the year ended december  was to reduce depreciation expense by million  or 
per basic and diluted share 
the decrease in depreciation expense caused by the increase in the estimated useful lives was offset in part by the increase in the company s asset base resulting from acquisitions in and capital additions to drilling rigs and marine vessels during and general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease is due primarily to a reduction of performance based compensation and other cost savings measures 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  as compared to the increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to increased professional fees and higher personnel costs 
other income expense 
other income expense for each of the three years in the period ended december   is as follows in millions interest income 


interest expense  net interest expense 


capitalized interest 


other  net 


interest income decreased million in  as compared to  due primarily to slightly lower average cash balances 
interest income increased million in from due to higher average outstanding cash balances 
the increase in average cash balances from to is primarily a result of increased cash flow from operations and cash received from the issuance of million in public debt in november interest expense decreased approximately  in  as compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances  as the company repaid certain term loans in the first quarter of in connection with early contract terminations in south america 
interest expense increased million in  as compared to the increase resulted from higher average debt balances 
the increase in average debt balances from to resulted from the issuance of million in public debt in november  offset in part by the retirement of other debt outstanding 
capitalized interest increased million in  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the ensco and ensco construction projects  which began during and remained in process at december  capitalized interest increased million in  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to construction projects initiated during for three barge rigs and the ensco other  net in consists primarily of a million gain recognized in connection with the resolution of certain contractual disputes relating to the sale of four barge rigs in october see contract drilling south america barge rigs and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other  net in consists primarily of a million gain recorded on the loss of the kodiak ii marine vessel  which sank in september the gain represents the insurance proceeds in excess of the net book value of the vessel see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
in  the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of million  and in and the company recorded income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in the income tax provision from to is primarily due to the reduced level of profitability and to the impact of restructuring certain foreign operations during the million decrease in the income tax provision from to is primarily due to a favorable settlement of a foreign tax matter and an adjustment of prior year accruals in liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations and capital expenditures 
year ended december  in millions cash flow from operations 


capital expenditures new construction and acquisitions 


enhancements 


sustaining 


in  cash flow from operations decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily a result of reduced operating margins and reduced cash flow from working capital changes 
in  cash flow from operations increased million  or  as compared to the increase in cash flow from operations was due primarily to working capital changes 
as part of the company s ongoing enhancement program  million has been invested over the last three years in upgrading the capability and extending the service lives of the company s drilling rigs and marine vessels 
in addition  the company has expanded the size of its drilling rig fleet through acquisitions and construction 
in  the company acquired a harsh environment  gorilla class  jackup rig located in the north sea and purchased the remaining interest in a previously jointly owned jackup rig located in southeast asia 
during  the company began construction of three barge rigs  a harsh environment jackup rig and a semisubmersible rig 
construction of the three barge rigs was completed in the first and second quarters of construction of the harsh environment jackup rig was completed in february  and completion of the semisubmersible rig construction is projected for the fourth quarter of capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  related to the new construction projects will be approximately million in in addition  management anticipates that capital expenditures will be approximately million for upgrades and enhancements and million for sustaining operations in the company may spend additional funds to construct or acquire rigs or vessels in depending on market conditions and opportunities 
financing and capital resources 
the company s long term debt  total capital and debt to capital ratios are summarized below in millions  except percentages at december  long term debt 


total capital  
 
 
long term debt to total capital in june  the company received a commitment from the united states maritime administration marad for the guarantee of approximately million of long term debt for the construction of the ensco  the company s new semisubmersible rig 
the marad guarantee covers interim construction financing  as well as year bonds to be issued upon completion of construction 
in december  the company entered into a floating rate term loan agreement the facility with a major financial institution the lender to provide interim financing during the rig construction period 
interest on amounts borrowed under the facility will be payable semi annually at a variable rate based on the lender s cost of funds plus 
at december  
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the facility  and the company expects to begin drawing funds in the first quarter of amounts borrowed under the facility will be repaid with proceeds from year bonds to be issued after completion of rig construction and repaid in semi annual payments of principal and interest 
the company currently expects to complete the rig construction in the fourth quarter of in may  the company entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
interest on amounts borrowed under the credit agreement are based on libor plus an applicable margin rate currently 
depending on the company s credit rating 
the company also pays a commitment fee currently 
per annum on the undrawn portion of the available credit line  which is also based on the company s credit rating 
the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants under the credit agreement which include the company meeting a specified level of interest coverage  assets to indebtedness  leverage ratio and tangible net worth 
as of december   the company had million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement matures in may the company s total capital decreased in as compared to primarily due to the payment of million in dividends in and the decrease in long term debt in  offset in part by the profitability of the company in the company s total capital increased in as compared to due primarily to the profitability of the company in  offset in part by the repurchase of approximately million shares of the company s common stock at a cost of million  and payment of cash dividends of million in the company s liquidity position is summarized in the table below in millions  except ratios at december  cash and short term investments 


working capital 


current ratio 


based on the current financial condition of the company  management believes cash flow from operations  the ensco financing guaranteed by marad  the company s existing credit agreement and the company s working capital should be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
on february   the company notified holders of its senior subordinated notes due the dual notes of its intent to exercise its option to redeem 
all outstanding dual notes will be redeemed on march   at a price equal to of the principal amount  which equates to approximately million see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against its exposure to changes in foreign currencies 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company predominantly structures its drilling rig contracts in us dollars to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
the company will  however  from time to time  hedge its known liabilities or projected payments in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of foreign currency gains and losses in its financial results 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding to exchange us dollars for dutch guilders and singapore dollars totaling million 
at december   there were no material unrealized gains or losses on open foreign currency exchange derivative hedges 
management believes that the company s hedging activities do not expose the company to any material interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk or any other market rate or price risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company will have exposure to market risk in connection with the variable interest rate on amounts borrowed under the facility  the company s interim construction financing guaranteed by marad see liquidity and capital resources financing and capital resources and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the facility is ultimately based on changes in libor  the company s exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in the facility interest rate are not expected to be material 
year update prior to january   the company performed an assessment of its critical information technology it and non it systems  corrected all deficiencies identified  and developed contingency plans for potential year issues 
to date  the company has experienced no problems in connection with year issues 
the total cost to make the company s systems and equipment year compliant was approximately  including software and systems replaced in the company s normal upgrade cycle 
the total cost does not include internal labor costs for employees who spent part of their time working on the company s year project 
outlook and forward looking statements due to the short term nature of many of the company s contracts and the unpredictable nature of oil and natural gas prices  which affect demand for drilling activity  timing of the improvement in industry conditions experienced during cannot be accurately predicted 
whether recent oil price levels will be sustained is not determinable at the present time  and even if current price levels persist  significantly higher average day rates for the company s fleet as a whole will probably not be realized for several quarters 
improved oil prices and us natural gas prices increased demand for drilling rigs and marine vessels in domestic markets during the latter part of  and the company experienced an increase in domestic day rates in the fourth quarter of in the near term  the company believes that improvements in day rates in domestic markets will generally continue 
although there have been early signs that demand for drilling rigs in international markets may be beginning to improve  as of this date there has been no appreciable improvement in day rates in international markets 
providing that current oil price levels are sustained  management expects a recovery in international markets to commence during the latter part of the company stacked certain rigs and vessels during as a result of industry conditions 
the company s policy is to stack its rigs and vessels if it does not believe there will be a market for the equipment in the near term or if sufficient cash flow cannot be generated to cover cash operating costs 
the company did not stack  and has no plans to stack  any of its north america jackup rigs 
in europe  the company stacked rigs in as a result of early terminations of long term contracts 
six of the company s rigs currently located in the europe region are idle 
however  five of the six idle rigs have secured contracts or letters of intent to commence drilling operations during the second quarter of  and the remaining idle rig is in the shipyard undergoing enhancements and upgrades  which the company expects to complete in the third quarter of in addition  construction of the ensco was completed in singapore in february  and the rig is currently mobilizing to the north sea  with arrival scheduled for april currently  the ensco is not under contract  and the company is actively marketing the rig 
in the asia pacific region  the company has two rigs that are currently idle  both of which are being actively marketed 
the company has six idle barge rigs in south america  four of which are stacked and two of which continue to be marketed 
in the marine transportation segment  there are currently three supply vessels and two mini supply vessels stacked 
the company anticipates recommissioning and marketing the three supply vessels in the second half of during  the company began construction of the ensco  a dynamically positioned semisubmersible rig 
the ensco has an approximate million  three year contract with burlington resources burlington that is scheduled to commence upon satisfactory completion of construction 
the company expects to complete construction during the fourth quarter of construction of a semisubmersible rig such as the ensco involves complex design and engineering  as well as extensive equipment and supply delivery coordination throughout the construction period 
it is not unusual for shipyards to encounter design and engineering changes  equipment delivery schedule changes  and other factors that impact the ability to complete construction in accordance with original contractual budgets and delivery schedules 
the shipyard constructing the ensco has recently experienced cost overruns and delays on other rig construction projects  including certain barge rigs built for the company 
to date  the company has not experienced significant cost overruns or unanticipated delays in connection with the ensco construction 
however  if construction delays should occur and the ensco is not delivered in accordance with the specifications agreed with burlington prior to the delivery deadline under the burlington contract of march   burlington has the right to terminate the contract 
termination of the burlington contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results
