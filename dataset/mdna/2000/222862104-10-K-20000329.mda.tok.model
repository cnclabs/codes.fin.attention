the company provides a full range of managed care products and services including health maintenance organization hmo  point of service pos and preferred provider organization ppo products 
the company also administers self insured plans for large employer groups 
coventry was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on december  during the three years ended december   the company experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due primarily to membership increase 
much of the growth was in and was attributable to the acquisition of the principal health care  inc phc plans effective april  additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts  acquisitions  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
the company s commercial managed care premium revenues during the three years in the period ended december  were comprised of premiums from its commercial hmo products and flexible provider products  including ppo and pos products for which the company assumes full underwriting risk 
premiums for such commercial ppo and pos products are typically lower than hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and copayments that are required from the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for commercial hmo products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings 
while the company has not had such filings modified  no assurance can be given that approvals for rate submissions will continue 
the public sector managed care premium revenues consists of premiums from the company s medicare risk  medicare cost and medicaid products 
the company provides comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receives premium payments from federal and state governments 
premium rates for the medicaid and medicare risk products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action 
the company s management services revenues result from operations in which the company s health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected hmo coverage 
the company receives an administrative fee for these services  but does not assume underwriting risk 
in addition  the company offers a ppo product to other third party payors  under which it provides rental of and access to the company s ppo network  claims repricing and utilization review  and does not assume underwriting risk

commercial membership grew by about  members despite pricing increases in most markets 
medicare membership was essentially flat  even though the company exited three counties in pennsylvania and reduced benefits and increased premiums in remaining service areas 
medicaid membership increased by about  members mainly due to the increase of membership in the delaware plan  as a result of another carrier exiting the medicaid program effective december  the remaining  member increase was a result of modest growth in non risk membership 
coventry s operating expenses are primarily medical costs  including medical claims under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers  and capitation payments 
medical claims expense also includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
coventry currently believes that the estimates for ibnr liabilities are adequate to satisfy its ultimate medical claims liability after all medical claims have been reported 
in determining the company s ibnr liabilities  coventry employs plan by plan standard actuarial reserve methods specific to the plan s membership  product characteristics  geographic territories and provider network that consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient  outpatient  pharmacy and other medical costs  as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements 
reserve estimates are reviewed by underwriting  finance and accounting  and other appropriate plan and corporate personnel and judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience  changes in the delivery system  changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
coventry periodically monitors and reviews its ibnr reserves  and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted  reflects these differences in current operations

shortly after aherf filed for bankruptcy protection  the company filed a lawsuit against aherf s non debtor  affiliated hospitals seeking monetary damages and a declaratory judgment that the company was not obligated to pay in excess of million to the hospitals for medical services provided by them to the company s members and the hospitals filed a counterclaim for payment of these services 
as a result  the company  which was ultimately responsible for medical costs delivered to its members  notwithstanding the global capitation agreement  recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of to establish a reserve for  among other things  the medical costs incurred by its members under the aherf global capitation agreement at the time of the bankruptcy filing

as of december   approximately million of the million reserve had been paid for medical claims

louis at december  under the agreement  bjc receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all of the medical treatment received by the globally capitated members 
global capitation agreements limit the company s exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose the company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization 
to the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the global capitation agreements  the company  which is responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to its customer agreements  will be required to perform such obligations  and may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the global capitation agreements 
various disputes alleging breaches have arisen under the bjc global capitation agreement concerning the accuracy and timeliness of claims payments  and the accuracy of membership reconciliations that would affect the amount of premiums paid to bjc to provide its services under the agreement 
bjc contends that these alleged breaches entitles it to terminate the agreement 
although the parties are obligated to arbitrate their disputes under the terms of the agreement  the parties have agreed to attempt to negotiate a resolution of the various issues concurrent with arbitration 
while the company acknowledges certain claims payment inaccuracies  the company denies the remaining allegations and vigorously disputes that any such claims constitute a material breach of the agreement 
management does not believe that the outcome of these disputes will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
other legal actions 
in the normal course of business  the company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions seeking payments for claims denied by the company  medical malpractice  and other monetary damages

incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
with respect to medical malpractice  the company carries professional malpractice and general liability insurance for each of its operations on a claims made basis for which the company maintains reserves 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
other managed care companies have been sued recently in class action lawsuits claiming violations of the federal racketeering act rico and federal employee benefits law erisa  and generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although it is possible that the company may be the target of a similar suit  the company believes there is no valid basis for such a suit

existing or future laws could have significant impact on the company s operations

legislation and regulation numerous proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform 
some proposals  if enacted  could among other things  restrict the company s ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers

year the company has been aware of the year issue that has the potential to affect products and systems that were not designed to properly handle the transition between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company recognized the need to ensure that its business operations would not be adversely impacted by the year  and it implemented a year readiness program to facilitate the necessary readiness preparations 
through december   the company incurred approximately million in its year assessment and remediation program  and it does not expect to incur significant further costs in this program 
prior to the end of  the company completed its readiness assessment and its implementation of all plans for handling anticipated readiness risks 
the company s transition from to occurred without any major business disruption 
with the transition into the year complete  the year issue has not had  and the company believes it will not have  a material impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
health care costs may rise faster than our ability to increase our premium rates  causing our profit margins to shrink which may in turn reduce our net income and adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
in the future  the costs of health care services and supplies that we provide to our membership may rise faster than our ability to increase premium rates 
if costs rise and we are unable to increase premium rates  our profit margins will shrink 
shrinking profit margins may reduce our net income and adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
premium rates for managed care plans generally have increased in recent months  but we could experience unforeseen decreases or severely limited increases in future premium rates 
also  of our premium revenues through february  were derived from governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the government generally fixes these premium rates and we cannot adjust them based on our anticipated costs 
recent legislation has limited medicare premium rate increases substantially as compared to increases permitted in prior years 
as a result  in the future the total costs of our government programs could exceed the total premiums that we receive from these programs 
if we are unable to increase our revenues and our profit margins shrink  our net income may decrease and the value of your investment in coventry may decline 
in the future  we may not be able to increase or maintain our current revenues 
since we no longer receive revenues under our agreements with principal life  which expired on december   there is a risk that we may not be able to replace the revenues generated from these fees 
we recognized revenues from these agreements of million in and million in we may also be unable to reduce our costs or increase our premium rates 
if we are faced with shrinking profit margins and are unable to increase our revenues  we will have a decline in net income  which could adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
increases in our revenues will be generally dependent upon our ability to increase premiums and membership 
in addition to the loss of revenues generated from the principal life fees  there are several factors that may affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues including rising costs loss of membership to our competitors failure to attract new members inability to increase premiums due to regulatory restrictions loss of membership due to increased premium rates withdrawal from unprofitable markets consumer preferences for lower priced health care options price competition our failure to accurately estimate future health care costs may result in premiums that are not sufficient to cover medical costs  which may negatively affect our operating results and reduce the value of your investment in coventry 
if we underestimate the costs of health care services and supplies that we provide to our members  we may set our premium rates too low 
low premiums may result in an inability to generate revenues that are sufficient to pay future health care costs 
this shortfall could significantly change our results of operations  affect profitability and adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
while we attempt to base the premiums we charge  at least in part on our estimate of expected health care costs over the fixed premium period  other factors may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs and could cause actual health care costs to exceed estimated health care costs 
these factors could include the increased cost of individual health care services the type and number of individual health care services delivered exceeding our expectations the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics seasonality and trends general inflation new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs operational issues insured population characteristics competitive pressures other unforeseen occurrences failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and loss of membership  which could cause a decline in the value of your investment in coventry 
we expect that substantially all of our members will be served by providers contracting with us to provide the requisite medical care 
our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a given geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of managed care products in those markets 
in addition  the terms of those provider contracts also have a material impact on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
we may not be able to reach cost effective agreements with certain major market providers which could reduce coventry s net income and cause a decline in the value of your investment in coventry 
in some of our markets  there are provider systems that have a major presence 
our product offerings and profitability may be adversely affected if these provider systems refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are unfavorable to us 
there is a risk that providers with whom we have capitation contracts may be financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their payment or medical care obligations under capitation agreements and that our members may prefer to utilize other providers with whom we do not have capitation contracts 
among the medical cost control techniques we have utilized are capitation agreements with providers pursuant to which we pay providers a fixed dollar amount per member per month  with the provider obligated to provide all of a particular type of medical service required by the members  and global capitation agreements pursuant to which a single integrated hospital physician provider system provides substantially all hospital and medical services to a large number of members for a fixed percentage of the premium we charge with respect to those members 
while these systems may shift to the contracting provider system the risk that medical costs will exceed the amounts anticipated  we will be exposed to the risks that the provider systems are financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their payment or medical care obligations under the capitation agreements 
in addition  it is possible that members may prefer other providers in the market with whom we do not have capitation agreements 
if our members choose to utilize providers with whom we do not have capitation agreements  we may incur higher costs 
these higher costs may reduce our net income and negatively impact the value of your investment in coventry 
principal life and its affiliates ability to exercise control over coventry could adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
as a result of our acquisition of the principal health care plans  principal life owns approximately of our common stock  on a fully diluted basis 
due to previously agreed upon limitations that are effective through april  principal life may purchase additional shares of our common stock  but only to maintain its ownership of our fully diluted common stock 
in addition to its ownership position  principal life has designated members of our member board of directors in correspondence with its percentage ownership of our common stock 
as long as principal life owns at least of our common stock  it can designate one member of our board of directors for each ownership of our common stock 
accordingly  principal life has the right to designate up to six members of our board 
principal life s ownership position and its representation on our board of directors  allow it to exert significant influence over the direction and operations of coventry 
in some instances  this influence could be used in a manner that is contrary to the best interests of our other stockholders  and may accordingly decrease the value of your investment in coventry 
it should be noted  however  that prior to april  principal life has agreed to vote its shares in favor of any acquisition required to be approved by our shareholders  that a special committee of our board of directors has recommended  and that a majority of our shareholders  other than principal life  have approved 
the special committee will consist of members of our board of directors that are neither management  nor designees of principal life 
additionally  prior to april  principal life has agreed to vote its shares for the election of directors nominated by the nominating committee of the board of directors  and not to oppose or seek removal of any person nominated by this nominating committee 
once the previously agreed upon limitations imposed on principal life expire in april  principal life may acquire additional shares of our common stock to the point that it exercises complete control over the company 
if principal life were to acquire over of our common stock  it would have actual control over us  and would have a controlling vote in all actions involving a shareholder vote 
as the majority shareholder  principal life could block transactions that were advantageous to our minority shareholders 
accordingly  the value of your investment in coventry could decline as future investors may not consider our common stock to be an attractive stock due to the percentage of our common stock held by principal life 
future and existing laws and rules governing coventry may impact our business and negatively affect our profitability 
coventry s industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth and or increase our health care and administrative costs 
regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained to market many of our products and services 
delays in obtaining or failing to obtain or maintain such approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our covered lives  or could increase our costs 
our contracts with federal and state government agencies are subject to periodic audits that could have an adverse result that may lead to a decline in the value of your investment in coventry 
coventry contracts with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
these agencies include the united states office of personnel management that contracts with us to provide managed health care services for federal employees under the federal employees health benefits program  the u 
s 
health care financing administration that contracts with us to provide a medicare product to eligible beneficiaries  and certain states that contract with us to provide a medicaid product to eligible recipients 
these contracts and applicable federal and state regulations  among other requirements  establish premium rating requirements or fixed premiums per member per month 
these governmental agencies and states may periodically audit us to verify our compliance with their contracts and applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
such audits could result in material adjustments 
an adverse audit of our contracts with governmental agencies could result in the loss of licensure  the loss of the right to participate in certain programs  the imposition of fines  penalties  and other sanctions and could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
in the future  we may not be able to meet certain minimum capitalization limits that may be adopted by states in which we do business 
the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed that states adopt risk free capital standards that  if implemented  would generally require higher minimum capitalization limits for health care coverage provided by hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
to date  no state where coventry has hmo operations has adopted those standards 
we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position in the near future 
we believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund any additional regulatory risk based capital 
costs associated with litigation may result in losses to us that could negatively impact the value of your investment in coventry 
we are susceptible to litigation and insurance risks  including medical malpractice liability  disputes relating to the denial of coverage and the adequacy of stop loss reinsurance for costs resulting from catastrophic injuries or illnesses 
coventry has contingent litigation risk with certain discontinued operations 
such litigation may result in losses to us that could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial performance  cash flows or future prospects and adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry
