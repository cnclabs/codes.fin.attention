item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we employ a sales staff as well as outside sales representative organizations to market our andrea anti noise products  our andrea dsp microphone and software products and our aircraft communications products 
andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are marketed to computer oems and related peripheral devices  distributors of personal computers and telecommunications equipment  software publishers  computer and consumer electronic retailers  and end users in both business and household environments 
these products are sold to end users through distributors and value added resellers  software publishers  internet service providers  internet content developers  and retailers 
under our existing collaborative agreements  our collaborative partners have various marketing and sales rights to our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we are seeking to enter additional collaborative arrangements for marketing and selling our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  but we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts 
market acceptance of the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products is critical to our success 
we market our aircraft communications products to oems  military organizations  and industrial customers 
production operations we conduct assembly operations at our new york facility and through subcontractors 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise products  we assemble the products at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular andrea anti noise product increase  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain specialized components  such as microphones and dsp boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
to date we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  but we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we assemble our aircraft communications products at our new york facility from purchased components 
certain highly specialized components for our aircraft communications products sold for military and industrial use have limited sources of supply  the availability of which can affect particular products 
we do not believe  however  that our earnings have been  or will be  materially affected due to unavailability of these components 
competition the markets for our andrea anti noise products  andrea dsp microphone and software products and aircraft communications products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than us 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
we cannot assure that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in the markets for our aircraft communications products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying to specific military initiatives 
our performance in these markets is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government inspectors 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and manufacture  assemble and market products  either alone or through third parties  in a profitable manner 
employees at december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in production and related operations  were engaged in research and development  and were engaged in management  administration  sales and customer support duties 
none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees

item properties andrea s corporate headquarters is located in melville  new york 
our corporate headquarters is located in approximately  square feet of leased space which houses our production operations  research and development activities  sales  administration and executive offices 
we also lease facilities in utah and israel dedicated for research and development  and in hong kong for production management and limited research and development activities 
we believe that we maintain our machinery  equipment and tooling in good operating condition and that these assets are adequate for our current business and adequately insured

item legal proceedings on november  a complaint was filed against us in the us district court for the eastern district of new york by nct group  inc nct  formerly noise cancellation technologies  inc and nct hearing products  inc  one of nct s subsidiaries 
the complaint involves two of andrea s patents  us patent no 
 and us patent no 
 these patents relate to certain active noise reduction technology that is particularly applicable to aircraft passenger headphones 
andrea does not currently derive any sales or licensing revenue from aircraft passenger headphones 
the complaint requests a declaration that these two patents are invalid and unenforceable and that nct s products do not infringe upon these two patents 
the complaint alleges that andrea has engaged in unfair competition by misrepresenting the scope of the two patents  tortuously interfering with prospective contractual rights between nct and its existing and potential customers  making false and disparaging statements about nct and its products  and falsely advertising andrea s anr products 
the complaint seeks to enjoin andrea from engaging in these alleged activities and seeks compensatory damages of not less than million  punitive damages of not less than million and plaintiffs costs and attorneys fees 
on december   we filed and served an answer to the nct complaint  denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
our counterclaims allege that nct has infringed us patents nos 
 and  and that nct has engaged in trademark infringement  false designation of origin  and unfair competition 
the counterclaims also allege that nct s patent infringement has been and is willful 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief with respect to the allegations of patent infringement  trademark infringement  false designation of origin and unfair competition 
we are also seeking exemplary and punitive damages  prejudgment interest on all damages  costs  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
during the second half of  both nct and andrea submitted briefs to the court on whether to have an early hearing on the meaning of the claims in the two andrea patents 
this type of hearing is called a markman hearing 
we anticipate that the court will issue a decision on this question by the middle of  but we cannot assure this 
we and nct are proceeding with discovery  including document production and depositions 
if this suit is ultimately resolved in favor of nct  we could be materially adversely effected 
we believe  however  that nct s allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend andrea and to assert against nct the claims described above 
on march   we were notified about a claim filed with the new york state environmental protection and spill compensation fund the fund by the owners mark j 
mergler and ann mergler  the claimants of property adjoining our former long island city facility 
this claim alleges property damages arising from petroleum migrating from our former facility and was purportedly detected in the basement of the claimants property 
in their claim to the fund  the claimants alleged that their property has been damaged and that they have incurred remedial costs 
in the event the fund honors this claim in whole or in part  we may be liable to reimburse the fund 
the new york state department of environmental conservation has asserted a demand that we investigate and remediate the discharge of petroleum from a fuel oil storage tank at our former long island city facility  and determine whether the petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimants adjoining property 
we engaged environmental consultants to investigate the discharge from the fuel oil storage tank and we are currently funding remediation work 
we denied  however  the allegations that any petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimant s property and objected to the claim made by the claimant to the fund 
on september   a civil action related to this matter was commenced in the nassau county supreme court by mark j 
mergler and ann mergler 
the plaintiffs allege that the fuel oil released from the heating system of our former facility has migrated beneath and onto the neighboring property causing an excess of  in direct and consequential damages 
the plaintiffs allegations against us include  negligence  nuisance and strict liability under the new york state navigation law 
we have submitted an answer denying the allegations and all liability relating to the alleged property damage 
this lawsuit is at an early stage and we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
in addition to the litigation described above  we are from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental to our business

balance sheet data current assets      total assets      current liabilities      total liabilities      redeemable securities  total equity      item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to provide the emerging voice interface markets with state of the art communications products that facilitate natural language  human machine interfaces 
examples of the applications and interfaces for which andrea anti noise r products and andrea dsp microphone and software products provide benefits include internet and other computer based speech  telephony communications  multi point conferencing  speech recognition  multimedia  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  military and commercial aircraft communications  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
we believe that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly in noisy environments  for use with personal computers  mobile personal computing devises  military and commercial aircraft systems  cellular and other wireless communication devices and automotive communication systems 
high quality audio communication technologies will also be required for emerging far field voice applications  ranging from continuous speech dictation  to multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration  to natural language driven interfaces for automobiles  home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years 
our strategy is to maintain and extend our market position with our andrea anti noise r products  broaden our andrea anti noise r product lines and andrea dsp microphone and software products lines through internal research and development and  from time to time  strategic acquisitions  design our products to satisfy specific end user requirements identified by our collaborative partners  and outsource manufacturing of certain products in order to achieve economies of scale 
an important element of our strategy for expanding the channels of distribution and broadening the base of users for our products is our collaborative arrangements with computer oems  software publishers  and distributors and retailers actively engaged in the various markets in which our products have application 
under some of these arrangements  we supply our products for sale by our collaborative partners 
under others  the collaborative partners supply us with software that we include with our products 
in addition  we have been increasing our own direct marketing efforts 
the success of our strategy will depend on our ability to  among other things  increase sales of our line of existing andrea anti noise r products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  contain costs  manage growth  introduce additional andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  maintain the competitiveness of our technologies through successful research and development  and achieve widespread adoption of our products and technologies 
in order to complement our internal efforts to develop digital signal processing dsp technology  in may  we acquired lamar signal processing  ltd 
lamar  an israeli corporation engaged in the development of dsp noise cancellation microphone solutions for voice driven interfaces covering a wide range of audio and acoustic applications 
this acquisition resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill 
the amortization of this goodwill had  and will continue to have  a negative  non cash impact on our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we outsource the assembly of most of our andrea anti noise r products from purchased components  and we are currently assembling our andrea dsp microphone and software productss from purchased components at our new york and israeli facilities 
we manufacture our aircraft communications products at our new york facility 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  and other items set forth in this report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  seeks  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management 
investors are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including economic  competitive  governmental  technological and other factors that may affect our business and prospects 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
in order to obtain the benefits of these safe harbor provisions for any such forward looking statements  we wish to caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors  which  among others  have in some cases affected our actual results and are in the future likely to affect our actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation our results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations 
the causes of these fluctuations include  among other things the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements  the cost of development of our products under our collaborative development arrangements  the mix of products we sell  the mix of distribution channels we use  the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors  fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace  and general economic conditions 
we cannot assure that the level of sales and gross profit  if any  that we achieve in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other fiscal periods 
our revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million in calendar for the year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately million versus a net loss of million for the year ended december  for the fourth quarter ended december   our revenues were approximately million versus million in the same period in for the fourth quarter of  we had a net loss of approximately million compared to net loss of approximately million in the same period in while we are examining opportunities for cost reduction  production efficiencies and further diversification of our business  we may continue to accumulate losses and the market price of our common stock could decline 
in order to remain competitive  we intend to continue to incur substantial research and development  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
these expenses may not be necessarily or easily reduced if sales revenue is below expectations and  therefore  net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by any reduction in sales revenue 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly and annual variations in our results of operations  losses of significant customers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in the outlook of our industry  our company and our competitors by securities analysts  or other events or factors  including the risk factors described in this report 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
meeting our future capital needs may adversely affect our business and be dilutive to existing shareholders our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs associated with developing  manufacturing and commercializing our products  maintaining existing  or entering into future  collaborative development  collaborative marketing and distribution agreements  protecting intellectual property rights  and expanding facilities and consummating possible future acquisitions of technologies  products or businesses 
from time to time during the past several years  we have raised additional capital from external sources 
we may continue to have to raise additional capital from external sources 
these sources may include private or public financings through the issuance of debt  convertible debt or equity  or collaborative arrangements 
we cannot assure that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in june  we sold million of series b convertible preferred stock and a related warrant for  shares of our common stock and  under certain conditions  we have the right to sell up to an additional million of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants for up to  shares of our common stock 
we cannot assure that such conditions will be satisfied or  if they are  that we will sell any additional series b convertible preferred stock or warrants 
shares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price  you may experience substantial dilution sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock 
of the  shares of common stock presently authorized   were outstanding as of march  this does not include i  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options granted under our performance equity plan and stock plan and shares of our common stock reserved for further option grants under the stock plan and ii  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and exercise of the related warrant 
to the extent that series b convertible preferred stock is converted  the related warrant is exercised  such options are exercised or we issue additional shares of capital stock  the ownership interests of holders of common stock would be diluted 
we have shares of series b convertible preferred stock and a warrant for  shares of common stock outstanding and  subject to certain conditions and limitations  we have the right during the six month period beginning march  to sell to the current holder of series b convertible preferred stock up to an additional shares of series b convertible preferred stock and a warrant for up to an additional  shares of common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock depends on the prices of the common stock as quoted on the american stock exchange shortly before the date of conversion 
we cannot predict the price of the common stock in the future 
if the price of our common stock decreases over time  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock will increase and the holders of common stock would experience substantial dilution of their investment 
on february   shares of the series b convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
in addition  in may  we issued  shares of common stock as part of the consideration for our acquisition of lamar signal processing  ltd  of which  shares of common stock are subject to trading restrictions that expire with respect to  shares in may and  in may as the restrictions expire  the shares are subject to demand and piggyback registration rights 
we must increase sales and profitability of our products and commercialize new products our business  results of operations and financial condition depend on successful commercialization of our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
sales of the initial andrea anti noise products began in  and since we have been expanding the number of products in this line 
the success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization  particularly companies in the computing and communications industries 
to achieve increased sales and profitability  we must  among other things increase market acceptance of our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  respond effectively to competitive pressures with the timely introduction of new andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  and successfully market and support these products 
we cannot assure that we will achieve or sustain significant sales or profitability of our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face intense competition the markets in which we sell our andrea anti noise products  andrea dsp microphone and software products and aircraft communications products are highly competitive 
competition in the markets for our andrea anti noise products  andrea dsp microphone and software products and aircraft communications products is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  brand recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technology development  marketing  technical support and other resources than we do 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
we cannot assure that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in the markets for our aircraft communications products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying products and technologies for specific military initiatives 
our performance in this market is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government administrators 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and develop  manufacture  assemble and successfully market products  either alone  in collaboration or with other parties 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully  and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to obtain market acceptance of our voice interface and internet communications products we and our competitors are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice  particularly in noisy environments  for a broad range of computer and communications applications 
the markets for these products and technologies have only recently begun to develop  are rapidly evolving  are characterized by a number of competitors  and are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
broad market acceptance of these products and technologies is critical to our success and ability to generate revenues 
we cannot assure that we  or our industry in general  will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of products and technologies 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  and the introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products 
in particular  we are currently engaged in the development and commercialization of our andrea dsp microphone and software products and related dsp technolgies for the voice  speech and natural language interface markets 
as part of this effort  we have established our andrea digital technologies subsidiary in the united states and have acquired lamar signal processing ltd  in israel 
we cannot assure that we will succeed in developing these new dsp products and technologies  or that any such new dsp products or technologies will gain market acceptance 
further  the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies 
we cannot assure that we will successfully anticipate and adapt in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards  develop  introduce and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products and technologies  as well as additional applications for existing products and technologies  or that the introduction of new products or technologies by others will not render our products and technologies obsolete 
our failure to develop new and enhanced products and technologies would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is highly dependent on our collaborative marketing arrangements we have entered into several collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
under these collaborative arrangements  our products are or will be sold to end users through inclusion of the products of our collaborators 
the revenue derived by us from these arrangements will be based in large part upon the sale of our collaborator s products 
our success will therefore be dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators in marketing existing products and new products under development with which to include our products and technologies 
we cannot assure that any product of any of our collaborators incorporating our products and technologies will be marketed successfully 
our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies 
furthermore  our collaborators may develop their own microphone or earphone products or technologies that compete with our products and technologies 
we cannot assure that these collaborators will not replace our products or technologies with  or give higher priority to  the sales of these competitive products or technologies 
we have also established direct arrangements with large electronic and computer retail chains in the united states  as well as with certain distributors in europe and the americas 
we cannot assure that any of these channels will devote sufficient resources to support the sale of our products 
we are also currently discussing additional arrangements with other software companies  several major personal computer companies  consumer electronic manufacturers  and electronic and computer retailers 
we cannot assure that any of these discussions will result in any definitive agreements 
we depend on a single customer for a substantial portion of our sales we are substantially dependent on our product procurement relationship with ibm 
during the years ended december   and  ibm and certain of ibm s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for  and  respectively  of our sales revenue 
while we are a party to a procurement agreement with ibm covering the purchase by ibm of certain of our andrea anti noise microphone and earphone products for inclusion with certain of ibm s personal computer products  ibm is not obligated to purchase these products and is free to purchase microphone and earphone products and technologies from our competitors 
our failure to maintain sales of andrea anti noise products to ibm would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain needed contract manufacturing we conduct assembly operations at our facility in new york and through subcontractors 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise products  we perform assembly operations at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular andrea anti noise product increase  assembly operations are primarily transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
any failure on the part of this subcontractor to meet our production and shipment schedules could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain specialized components for the andrea antinoise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  such as microphones and dsp boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
while we have  to date  been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we assemble our aircraft communications products at our new york facility from purchased components 
certain highly specialized components for our aircraft communications products sold for military and industrial use have limited sources of supply  the availability of which can affect certain of our projects 
while we do not believe that our results of operations have been  or will be  materially affected if such components are unavailable  we cannot assure that this will continue to be the case 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights that may fail to protect our business we rely on a combination of patents  patent applications  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  nondisclosure agreements with our employees  licensees and potential licensees  limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information  and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we cannot assure  however  that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent its misappropriation or circumvention 
we have been granted patents in the united states covering our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products  and we have other us and us patent applications currently pending 
we cannot assure that patents will be issued with respect to these applications or any patent applications filed by us in the future 
numerous patents have been granted in the fields of noise cancellation  noise reduction  digital signal processing  computer voice recognition and related subject matter 
we expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap 
moreover  the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be infringed  challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by others  that the patents or proprietary rights of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  that we will be able to obtain licenses to patents of others  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all  or that we will be able to develop additional patentable technology that may be needed to successfully commercialize our existing technologies 
we are subject to litigation relating to our business from time to time to we are subject to litigation incidental to our business 
we are currently defending two lawsuits that are described in item legal proceedings of this report 
in addition  we are subject to the risk of adverse claims  interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  oppositions to patent applications outside the united states  and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation to establish the validity of patents  to assert infringement claims against others  and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is in our favor 
our international operations may be subject to certain risks we have been seeking to increase our sales to regions outside the united states  particularly in europe and certain areas in the americas and asia 
for the year ended december   sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our sales revenue 
international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including trade restrictions in the form of license requirements  restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in establishing or managing distributor relationships  general economic conditions  and political and economic instability or conflict 
to date  we have invoiced our international sales in u 
s dollars  and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
we cannot assure that this will continue to be the case 
if we are required to invoice any material amount of international sales in non us currencies  fluctuations in the value of non us currencies relative to the non us dollar may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations 
qualified managerial and technical personnel are scarce in our industry our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high quality personnel  especially management and product and technology development teams 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
our inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and new york law may adversely affect our stockholders the new york business corporation law  our certificate of incorporation and our series a junior participating preferred stock each contain certain provisions which may  in effect  deter  or make difficult  a change in control  merger or other acquisition of andrea 
for example  our board of directors may issue up to  shares of preferred stock without any stockholder vote or action 
the preferred stock could have voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of our common stock  and  therefore  any issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease in sales for the year ended december  reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise r products to  or of total sales  and an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during were the lower volumes and lower price lower margin sales of pc headsets to the company s original equipment manufacture oem customers 
for the year ended december   sales of our computer headsets to one customer and certain of that customer s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for approximately of our total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily a result of the shift in product mix described above under sales 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  this increase is due to the company s continuing efforts to develop its digital signal processing based  microphone array technologies  coupled with  to a lesser extent  efforts in computer telephony headset technologies 
research efforts are focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating the company s digital super directional array microphone technology dsda and certain other technologies obtained through the acquisition of lamar in may correspondingly  the activities of lamar accounted for approximately of the total research and development expenses during the company believes that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces its position in digital signal processing by extending the company s marketing programs to other industries  including the consumer electronics and professional audio markets  among others

net income loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of over sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease primarily reflects a shift in product mix to lower priced and lower margin products to original equipment manufacturers oems with an approximate decrease in per unit sales prices during the year ended december   and was offset in part by a increase in unit shipments for the year ended december  over december  the decrease in sales for the year ended december  reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise r products to  or of total sales  and an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales 
for the year ended december   sales of our computer headsets to one customer and certain of that customer s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for approximately of our total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily a result of the shift in product mix described above 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  this increase is primarily a result of our continuing efforts to develop our digital signal processing technology  coupled with efforts in computer telephony headset technologies 
these efforts resulted in ten new products during the year ended december  in addition  included research and development activities at our wholly owned subsidiary  andrea digital technologies adt  that was established during the second quarter of and which operates out of a separate facility in utah 
research efforts at adt are primarily focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating the digital super directional array microphone technology dsda obtained through the acquisition of lamar in may correspondingly  the activities of lamar  since the date of acquisition  accounted for approximately of the total research and development expenses for the year ended december  we believe that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces our position in digital signal processing by broadening our exposure to other industries  including the consumer electronics and professional audio markets  among others 
we anticipate continued significant increases in research and development expenses  with particular emphasis on digital signal processing efforts 
general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase  primarily attributable to the anc anr product lines and the acquisition of lamar  reflect significant increased business development expenses relating to existing and prospective collaborative arrangements with oems  software publishers and developers  distributors and retailers 
we also incurred increased promotional  marketing and sales expenses to promote product awareness and acceptance of the anc anr product lines  particularly in the retail marketplace  and incurred significant expenses with developing global expansion efforts 
also included in general  administrative and selling expenses is goodwill amortization expense of approximately million related to the acquisition of lamar 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to other income of  for the year ended december  this change is primarily attributable to the net gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters in long island city during the year ended december  of  offset by net interest expense of  primarily related to the convertible notes issued and sold in june provision for income taxes we did not record income tax expense for the year ended december  in light of the net loss recorded for the year 
the realization of our reserved deferred tax assets excluding those generated and reserved during  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
the income tax expense of  for the year ended december  resulted from the effect of a provision for income taxes at our effective income tax rate  substantially offset by a reduction in our reserve on previously generated  fully reserved deferred income tax assets 
we will be continually re assessing our reserves on deferred income tax assets on a quarterly basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net income loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of convertible notes and preferred stock to certain financial institutions 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december  is primarily a result of the company s issuance and sale in a private placement of  of its series b redeemable convertible preferred stock the preferred stock  and from the company s june private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes notes 
all but million of the notes have been converted to common stock  with the remaining outstanding principal amount convertible into  shares of common stock  which amount is recorded as a current liability  net of an unaccreted discount of  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  furthermore  on february   shares of the preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company is using the net proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock and notes for costs associated with technology development  tooling costs  creating and maintaining strategic alliances  payment of certain debt obligations and general working capital requirements 
in connection with the acquisition of lamar  of the aggregate cash consideration to be paid by the company   was paid on may   the closing date  and  was paid on each of the six and twelve month anniversaries of the closing date  with the remainder payable in two equal installments on each of the twenty four and thirty six month anniversaries of the closing 
the current portion of long term debt is comprised of approximately 
million in additional cash consideration due on the twenty four month anniversary of the closing 
the approximate 
million in additional cash consideration remaining  due on the thirty six month anniversary of the closing  is recorded as long term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of  offset by an increase in total current liabilities of  the increase in total current assets reflects an increase in cash of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  a decrease in inventory of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  the increase in current liabilities reflects a  increase in convertible notes recorded net of an unaccreted discount of  representing the remaining obligation from the notes described above  a decrease in trade accounts payable of  an increase in the current portion of long term debt of  and a  decrease in other current liabilities 
the increase in cash of  reflects  of net cash used in operating activities   of net cash used in investing activities and  of net cash provided by financing activities 
the cash used in operating activities  excluding non cash charges  is primarily attributable to the  net loss for the year ended december   a  increase in other assets and a  decrease in other current and long term liabilities  partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable and a  decrease in inventory 
the increase in other assets primarily reflects increases in patent and trademark costs associated with the company s proprietary technologies 
the decrease in other current and long term liabilities as well as the decrease in inventory primarily reflect differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of raw materials as well as for other services in connection with ongoing efforts related to the andrea anti noise product line 
the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects the level of the fourth quarter sales  coupled with timing of sales collection 
generally  the company collects receivables from sales within two months 
the cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to investments in the company s existing information systems  as well as  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures consisting of the ongoing upgrade of manufacturing dies and molds for andrea anti noise products 
the net cash provided by financing activities reflects the issuance and sale of the preferred stock and the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by the 
million cash consideration paid to the former shareholders of lamar in connection with the acquisition in may demand for the company s products and technologies has required the company to raise additional working capital to support operations 
in addition  the acquisition of lamar will require the company to continue to provide working capital to support lamar s operations and to repay notes to the sellers of lamar 
in december  april and august  the company raised working capital through the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
in june  the company raised million through the issuance and sale of the notes 
in june  the company raised million through the issuance and sale of preferred stock 
in addition  the company entered into a revolving credit agreement in september that provides maximum borrowings of up to million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
at december   there were no outstanding amounts under the revolving credit agreement 
we believe that our current levels of cash  as well as our access to financing sources  provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund working capital requirements for at least twelve to eighteen months 
notwithstanding the significance of sales of andrea anti noise products as a percentage of our total sales during  we cannot assure that demand will continue for these products or any of our other products  including future products related to our andrea microphone array products and software technologies  or  that if such demand does exist  that we will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms  or at all 
year our comprehensive program to address year issues was successful in that our business activities continued without disruption through the days before and after january  and february  in terms of supply chain readiness  on the basis of the information available to us  we do not expect disruptions caused by the failures of third parties to remediate their year issues 
costs related to the year program were  as anticipated  approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal source of financing activities includes debt under a revolving credit facility that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate  as well as the issuance of convertible debt with major financial institutions 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable in cash by us under the revolving credit facility  as well as the amount payable in stock by us under convertible debt 
a significant rise in interest rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  and approximately million of remaining unconverted debt see notes and to the financial statements 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
in addition  substantially all transactions by us are denominated in us dollars 
as such  we have shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  we could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations
