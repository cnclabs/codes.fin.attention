analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  was a record  a increase over the  reported for the net income amounted to basic earnings per share of  a increase over the basic earnings per share in diluted earnings per share for amounted to  a increase from the reported for the increase in earnings is primarily a result of the strong recent growth the company has experienced in its loan and deposit bases 
in  loans grew by and deposits grew by 
additionally since january   the company s loans have grown by a total of and deposits have increased by 
the effect of recognizing the net interest income on a full twelve months of the loan and deposit growth  as well as the incremental impact of the growth resulted in an increase in net interest income of in compared to partially offsetting the effects of the loan and deposit growth on net interest income was a decrease in the company s net interest margin from in to in because the company s asset quality remained sound in  and due to the lower loan growth experienced in compared to  the company s provision for loan losses of  in was slightly less than the  provision recorded in the strong growth in the company s loan and deposit bases has also driven the company s increase in noninterest income by providing access to more customers to whom the company can provide fee based services 
in  total noninterest income increased from  in to  in core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  as well as nonrecurrring items  increased  or  during  from  in to  in noninterest income not defined as core amounted to  and  during and  respectively  and is discussed in more detail below 
noninterest expenses increased  or  from  in to  in these higher operating expenses were experienced in all areas of the company s operations and are associated with the growth in the company s branch network and customer base 
the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the company s effective tax rate decreased in to from in the reduction in the effective tax rate is largely due to the favorable state tax treatment of the real estate investment trust first troy 
overview compared to net income for amounted to  a increase over the  earned in the net income amounted to basic earnings per share  a increase over the basic earnings per share in earnings per share on a diluted basis amounted to in compared to in  an increase of 
results included  pretax in gains from commercial loan sales  which had not been common from a historical perspective but were the type of gain that could occur again under certain circumstances and did occur  though to a lesser extent  in 
results included  pretax in nonrecurring income related to the receipt of an early termination fee for a data processing contract 
a primary contributor to the growth in earnings during was a increase in the company s net interest income 
this increase was a result of strong growth in loans and deposits 
partially offsetting the effects on earnings of the loan and deposit growth was a decrease in the company s net interest margin and a higher provision for loan losses 
the increase in the provision for loan losses from  in to  in was primarily attributable to the significant loan growth experienced by the company  and not because of concerns about the company s asset quality 
also contributing to the growth in earnings was a increase in the company s noninterest income  which grew from  in to  in  an increase of  core noninterest income increased  or  during  from  in to  in noninterest income not defined as core amounted to  and  during and  respectively  and is discussed in more detail below 
noninterest expenses increased  or  from  in to  in these higher operating expenses were experienced in all areas of the company s operations and were associated with the growth in the company s branch network and customer base 
net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in these increases in net interest income were primarily a result of increases in the amount of average loans and deposits outstanding when comparing to and to in  the average amount of loans outstanding grew by  while the average amount of deposits increased by 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
the effects of the increases in average loans and deposits on taxable equivalent net interest income in both and were partially offset by an overall narrowing of the company s interest rate spread 
the company s net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points to in compared to in s yield of was basis points lower than the margin realized in the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities also declined with a decrease of basis points in to from in s interest rate spread of was basis points lower than the realized in part of the reason for the company s narrowing net interest margin in was due to the company s yk liquidity plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter of the company estimates that excluding the effects of the excess liquidity called for by the plan that the net interest margin for would have been and the interest rate spread would have been 
average interest rates over the past two years have been lower than the immediately preceding year 
the average prime rate in was compared to in and in the lower interest rates have resulted in lower yields earned on interest earning assets  as well as lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
however  over the past two years  the company s yields on its interest earning assets have decreased by more than the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  the average loan yield decreased basis points from in to in the yield of was basis points lower than the yield in the company believes that there are two likely reasons that the company s loan yield has decreased at a greater rate than interest rates in general 
first  the company s loan mix has experienced a continuing slight shift from loans not secured by real estate to loans secured by real estate 
as table illustrates  loans secured by real estate construction and mortgage as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio have increased from of the total portfolio at year end to at year end to at year end the company s loans secured by real estate generally carry lower interest rates than loans not secured by real estate because they typically are judged to have a lower risk of credit loss than loans not secured by real estate 
the disproportionate growth in loans secured by real estate is associated with a strategic effort by the company to more fully leverage its balance sheet and branch network 
the company s average loans and deposits per branch has historically been and continues to be low when compared with industry averages 
in the last two to three years  the company has implemented a high growth strategy to better leverage its branch network and provide higher returns on shareholders equity 
this strategy has resulted in the company targeting higher balance loans  loans for which the company generally requires real estate as collateral 
as noted above  loans secured by real estate generally carry lower interest rates than loans not secured by real estate 
while lower interest rate loans have negatively impacted the company s net interest margin yields  they have incrementally added to the company s earnings 
the second reason for decreasing loan yields has been that a substantial amount of the company s loan growth has occurred in markets that are highly competitive 
while the company operates in some markets where competition is more limited  a large percentage of the company s loan growth in the past two to three years has been in growing markets in the state where the company faces intense competition and must price its loans accordingly 
the yields the company earns on its investment portfolio have also declined 
the yield earned on the company s taxable investments  the large majority of the company s portfolio  declined from in to in to in this decrease over the past two years has been due to the lower trend in interest rates in the bond market and has been accelerated by issuer calls of securities that had call options 
the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities have decreased less than the decreases in yields on interest earning assets 
in  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was  or basis points less than the average rate paid in the rate was basis points higher than the average rate paid of in the primary reasons that rates paid on interest bearing liabilities have not decreased at the same pace as the decreases in yields on interest earning assets are that the company has more competitively priced its deposits to fund its strong loan growth and a higher reliance on time deposits greater than  and borrowed funds  both of which generally carry higher interest rates 
in  the average balance of time deposits greater than  and borrowings comprised of total average interest bearing liabilities 
in  this percentage increased to and in the percentage further increased to 
the increase in the reliance on time deposits greater than  and borrowed funds has been necessary because of the need to fund the strong loan growth  the lower growth rates of the other liabilities that have lower interest rates  and the strategy to leverage the company s branches discussed above 
changes in total interest income and total interest expense result from changes in both volumes and rates in the related earning asset and interest bearing liability categories 
table shows the quantitative effects on net interest income of the changes in volumes and rates experienced by the company 
as discussed above and illustrated in table  changes in volumes have been the primary cause of changes in the amounts of interest income and interest expense recorded by the company 
see additional information regarding net interest income on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company made provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in the changes in the provisions for loan losses over the past three years have been primarily due to variances in new loan volumes experienced  and not due to changes in the company s asset quality 
net loan growth in amounted to million compared to million in as discussed in the section entitled nonperforming assets below  asset quality ratios for were very consistent with those for the company s million in net loan growth in was substantially more than the million originated in and resulted in the increase in the provision for loan losses despite the improved asset quality ratios in compared to see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the bank s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in the increase in noninterest income compared to was driven by a  or  increase in the amount of core noninterest income earned by the company 
core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  as well as nonrecurrring items  increased from  in to  in the increase in total noninterest income from to was also driven largely by an increase in core noninterest income 
core noninterest income increased  or in compared to noninterest income not defined as core amounted to a net of  in   during  and  in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or in after increasing  or  in the increase was due primarily to a higher service fee schedule that was implemented in march  as well as an increase in deposit accounts 
the increase was due to the growth in deposits 
however  excluding the effects of the higher fee schedule  service charges on deposit accounts have not increased at the same rate as deposits over the last two years 
the company believes that this is primarily due to the mix of the company s deposit growth 
the growth in transaction accounts  which includes demand  savings  and money market deposits and generates the majority of these fees  has not been as great as the growth in time deposits  which have fewer related fees 
additionally  the dollar increases that have occurred in the outstanding balance of transaction accounts have been more heavily concentrated in a fewer number of accounts with large balances as a result of the company s growth strategy discussed above 
other service charges  commissions  and fees increased by  or in  after increasing by  or in this category of noninterest income includes items such as safety deposit box rentals  check cashing fees  credit card and merchant income  and atm surcharges 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these transaction related fee services as a result of overall growth in the company s customer base 
increases in fees earned from surcharges levied on non customer atm transactions  which began in march  also enhanced the growth in this category of income 
atm surcharge revenue amounted to  in and  in  and is helping to defray the significant capital investment and maintenance expense incurred on atm machines 
fees that the company earns from presold mortgage loans grew by  in  or after increasing by  or during the lower interest rate environment experienced over the past two years  which has been conducive to mortgage loan refinancings  was largely responsible for the increase in these fees 
due to the rising interest rate environment toward the end of  the amount of these fees decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of and lower levels of these fees will likely continue into the year commissions from insurance sales increased by  in after decreasing by  in the increase was due to a  experience bonus paid to the company from the company that provides the credit life insurance that the company earns commissions from selling 
this payment was due to favorable loss experience on credit insurance policies that the company sold 
the amount of this payment is computed annually and is dependent on the amount of losses that result from policies that the company sells and thus may be more or less than the amount in future years 
the company did not receive an experience bonus in or the  decrease in commissions from insurance sales in was a result of lower commission fee rates negotiated with brokers  as well as a higher percentage of the company s customers utilizing their home equity lines of credit to finance consumer purchases versus obtaining consumer installment loans  where the company has typically sold more insurance policies 
data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
montgomery data had one nonaffiliated customer for the first eleven months of  at which time the customer terminated its contract as a result of being acquired by another institution 
this customer was responsible for the  in data processing fees earned in montgomery data did not have any nonaffiliated customers from december to december in december  a contract was signed to provide data processing for a nearby de novo bank 
this customer was charged  in december and  for the year of in data processing services 
in march  montgomery data was contracted to perform limited item processing services for another de novo bank in the area at an annual rate that is currently approximately  montgomery data earned  from this customer in noninterest income not defined as core amounted to a net of  in   during  and  in the primary reason for the variance between and was fewer gains from commercial loan sales 
during  the company sold approximately million in newly originated commercial loans that resulted in gains of  these sales were executed primarily to manage the significant loan growth experienced in  as well as to maintain a proper balance between the amount of loans and deposits that the company maintains 
in  loan growth slowed and the company did not believe it was necessary to sell as many commercial loans as in in  million in commercial loan sales were made at a total gain of  in  noninterest income not classified as core was primarily comprised of an early termination fee in the amount of  that montgomery data received from the bank discussed above that terminated its data processing contract with montgomery data prematurely 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  a increase over the amount of  the amount was higher than the  incurred in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
the increases in noninterest expenses in the past two years occurred in almost all categories and were due primarily to the company s growth 
the company incurred higher expenses in order to properly process  manage  and service the increase in loans and increase in deposits that have occurred over the past two years 
personnel expense  the single largest component of noninterest expense  increased in and during these increases were primarily due to additional employees associated with the company s growth  as well as normal annual wage increases 
the total number of employees of the company increased in and in also included in noninterest expenses in are professional fees and other expenses totaling approximately  incurred in connection with the company s formation of first troy  a subsidiary formed as a real estate investment trust that allows the company to centrally manage a portion of its residential  mortgage  and commercial real estate loan portfolio 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in tax expense in compared to is a result of a increase in pretax income  which was largely offset by a decrease in the company s effective tax rate from in to in the reduction in the effective tax rate for is largely due to the favorable state tax treatment of the real estate investment trust first troy 
the increase in tax expense in compared to is a result of a increase in pretax income  as well as an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the company s effective tax rate occurred as a result of the company deriving a smaller percentage of its earnings from tax exempt securities 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition the following discussion focuses on the factors considered by management to be important in assessing the company s financial condition 
the company s assets and deposits continued strong growth rates that began in  reflecting growth in existing markets and expansion into new geographic areas 
as previously noted  over the past two years  the company s loans have grown by and deposits have grown by 
growth rates over the past three years have been for loans and for deposits 
total assets were million at december   an increase of over december  assets during grew to million at year end  a increase over the million at december  interest earning assets amounted to million at december   a increase over the amount at december  interest earning assets at december  were million  an increase of over the million held at december  loans  the primary interest earning asset  grew in and in  with a total of million at december  deposits were the primary funding source in and for the growth in loans 
deposits increased  or million  during  amounting to million at year end 
in  deposits grew  or million  to million at year end 
the company s assets  loans  and deposits experienced compound annual growth rates of approximately   and  respectively  over the last five years ended december  distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance in this table is the shift in asset mix over the past two years from securities to loans that is primarily due to strong loan growth that was partially funded with proceeds from securities maturities and sales 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in securities in was primarily due to two reasons the company s decision not to reinvest security paydowns and maturities during the last four months of as part of the company s yk liquidity plan and security proceeds were used to help fund loan growth  which exceeded deposit growth in because of the uncertainty regarding possible increased customer withdrawals of deposits due to yk fears  the company s yk liquidity plan called for  among other things  the company not to reinvest proceeds from security paydowns and maturities into additional securities  but rather to invest the proceeds in highly liquid overnight interest bearing accounts 
the second reason for the decrease in securities at year end was loan growth that exceeded deposit growth  which required using securities to partially fund the loan growth 
as previously noted  loan growth during was million compared to deposit growth of million 
the increase in securities at december  compared to december  was largely due to the company purchasing approximately million in securities during the fourth quarter of until the fourth quarter of  because of the relatively flat yield curve  the company maintained its excess cash in overnight investments 
with the steepening of the yield curve that occurred with the three successive basis point rate cuts by the federal reserve beginning in early october  management of the company purchased securities to realize the higher yield that could be obtained from securities versus overnight investments 
average total securities were approximately million during compared to million during and million in the higher average balance in securities during was due to the effects of the million in securities that the company purchased in the fourth quarter of the lower average balance in securities during compared to was due to the company holding more cash in overnight investments versus investing in securities for most of the year for the reasons discussed above 
the composition of the securities portfolios at december  compared to reflects the company s decision not to reinvest proceeds received from paydowns  calls  and maturities of the company s mortgage backed security portfolio during the last four months of the year as part of the company s yk liquidity plan  as discussed above 
comparing to reflects a shift from us treasuries and government agencies to higher yielding mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  at december   net unrealized losses of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale compared to net unrealized gains of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the generally higher bond interest rate environment in effect at each of the past two year ends has been the primary factor in the decline in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities compared to their cost 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was less than the carrying value at december  by  while their fair value exceeded their carrying value by  at december   and  at december  management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed securities are shown in the time periods consistent with their estimated life based on expected prepayment speeds 
approximately of the available for sale portfolio has a maturity date within years 
the weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the maturity date for non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
in the rate environment in effect at december   none of the company s callable bonds in the available for sale portfolio are expected to be called  and thus the expected life of the portfolio is also years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the weighted average life of the securities held to maturity portfolio based on maturity dates was years at december  with a weighted average taxable equivalent yield of 
if above market callable bonds are assumed to be called on their call date  the weighted average maturity of the held to maturity portfolio drops slightly to years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the collateralized mortgage obligations previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
loans increased by million  or  in to million from the million held at december  the year end amount was million  or  higher than the million balance at december  the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or in and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
in  real estate mortgage loans grew  real estate construction loans decreased  commercial  financial  and agricultural cf a loans grew  and installment loans to individuals grew 
in  real estate mortgage loans grew  real estate construction loans grew  cf a loans grew  and installment loans to individuals grew 
for four out of the past five years  cf a loans have comprised a lower percentage of the loan portfolio  and for five straight years  installment loans to individuals have decreased in relation to the overall portfolio 
as discussed above in the section entitled net interest income  this shift from non real estate to real estate loans has been partially due to a strategic shift towards higher dollar loans  which tend to be secured by real estate in most cases  in order to more quickly leverage the bank s balance sheet and branch network 
as noted earlier  the shift to a higher percentage of real estate loans has contributed to the decrease in the bank s loan yields and net interest margin  as real estate loans generally carry lower interest rates than non real estate loans 
a large portion of the company s loan portfolio has historically been comprised of loans secured by various types of real estate 
at december   million or of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on other types of real estate 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
these percentages are approximately the same as they were at december  the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  compared to and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
the yield on performing loans as of december  was compared to at december  and at december  the increase in the yield at december  compared to a year earlier is due to an increase in the prime rate of interest of basis points during the lower yield at december  compared to december  is primarily due to a basis point lowering of the prime rate during both years were affected by the company s general trend  beginning in the second half of  of originating larger balance real estate loans with slightly lower yields as discussed previously 
see additional information regarding interest rate risk on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no such loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes highly probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
although the amount of nonperforming loans at december  of  is almost the same as the  from a year earlier  as it relates to the nonaccrual loans  virtually all of the borrowers comprising the nonaccrual balance are different between the two year ends  reflecting the resolution of s nonaccrual loans via payoff  charge off  or return to accrual status 
the decrease in nonperforming loans from to was primarily due to improved overall loan quality  as well as the pay out of a  loan in the first quarter of that was on nonaccrual status at december  the decrease in nonperforming loans at december  as compared to december  is primarily attributable to the resolution of several relationships that resulted in partial charge offs during the year  as well as generally improved loan quality 
the increase in nonperforming loans at december  compared to december  was largely due to  more in loans on nonaccrual status that were assumed in corporate acquisitions occurring in and these nonaccrual loans that were originated by other institutions amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  as of december   the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being approximately  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts included above  management believes that an estimated  of loans that are currently performing in accordance with their contractual terms may potentially develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate totaled  at december  compared to  at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the increase in the level of other real estate at december  when compared to the prior two year ends primarily relates to the reclassification of two bank branches that were closed during from premises and equipment to other real estate 
the company s management has reviewed recent appraisals of its other real estate and believes that their fair values  less estimated costs to sell  exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans has been gradually decreasing since its high of at september  the september  high of was an increase from the ratio at june  due primarily to an addition to the allowance of million that was recorded in the third quarter of in connection with a corporate acquisition in which a higher risk loan portfolio was acquired 
the general decrease in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans since then has been largely due to charge offs associated with that portfolio  strong recent loan growth  as well as generally improved overall loan quality 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased from  at december  to  at december  the december  allocated amount of  was an increase from the december  amount of  the increase in the allocated amounts for both years was primarily due to growth in the company s loan portfolio 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the general increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses has been consistent with overall loan growth 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category  and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and  respectively 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew million or in to million 
average deposits for grew by over the average to million 
average time deposits greater than  have experienced the highest percentage growth of any of the deposit categories in each of the past two years 
in  average time deposits greater than  increased million or  while in these deposits increased million  or 
the primary reason for the high growth within this category of deposits is that the company began more competitively pricing this category of deposits in order to help fund the strong loan growth experienced both years and to leverage the branch network  as has been discussed previously 
the company also priced time deposits greater than  especially competitively toward the end of in order to provide funding for potential yk related withdrawals 
while not as high as the growth rates of time deposits greater than  the growth in the other categories of deposits has been strong over the past two years 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased in and in average savings deposits increased in and in average interest bearing time deposits increased in and in average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased in and in the company s growth in deposits did not keep pace with its growth in loans during comparing year ends  total loan growth in was million  while deposit growth was million 
the company attributes this trend partially to yk deposit withdrawals or non deposits 
however  the company also believes that due to increased competition from sources that can more easily take deposits than can originate loans such as brokerage houses  internet banks  and the stock market in general  this trend is likely to continue 
accordingly  the company anticipates that in order to continue to provide funding for loan growth  rates paid on deposits will continue to rise in comparison to the general market  and alternative funding sources such as long term borrowings may be necessary 
as noted in the net interest income section above  the average yield on the company s interest bearing deposits did not decrease in as much as the average interest rate environment in general 
this is primarily due to the company having a higher mix of time deposits greater than  for the reasons noted above 
the average rates paid in the various individual deposit categories in generally tracked the lower market interest rates in effect during most of compared to the average interest rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits decreased basis points during from to 
the average interest rate paid on savings accounts decreased only basis points during to from in this lower rate of decrease in the average rate paid is associated with this category achieving a majority of its growth in the highest rate savings account that the company offers the preferred savings account 
the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points in from to  while the average rate paid on time deposits greater than  decreased basis points in  from to 
in  despite a slightly lower interest rate environment compared to  three of the four categories of interest bearing deposits experienced increases in the average rates paid and the fourth  interest bearing demand deposits  only experienced a basis point decrease 
this was largely due to two reasons the company priced all of its deposits more competitively in an attempt to fund the significant loan growth experienced in  and as it relates to the interest bearing demand deposits and the savings deposits categories  the majority of the growth within these two categories was within the highest yielding account types within these categories 
the company has a large  stable base of time deposits with little dependence on volatile public deposits of  or more 
the time deposits are principally certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts obtained from individual customers 
deposits of local governments and municipal entities represented of the company s total deposits at december  all such public funds are collateralized by investment securities 
the company does not purchase brokered deposits 
as of december   the company held approximately  in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of  table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
borrowings the company has three sources of borrowing capacity an approximately  line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a  overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately  line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window 
the company did not obtain any long term borrowings under these any of these credit lines during  or the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately  can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need  and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
during and  the company periodically used this line of credit as a short term  overnight borrowing to meet internally targeted liquidity levels that carried an interest rate that was approximately basis points higher than the national discount rate 
in addition  on october   the company obtained a three month  borrowing from the fhlb at a fixed interest rate of in connection with the company s yk liquidity plan 
at december   a total of  was outstanding under the fhlb line of credit   of which was the three month borrowing at and  which was an overnight  adjustable rate borrowing that had an interest rate of on december  there was no amount outstanding under this line of credit at december  or the company also has a correspondent bank relationship established that allows the company to purchase up to  in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
the company had no borrowings under this line at december  at december   the company had  outstanding under this arrangement at an interest rate of approximately 
during  the company established a line of credit totaling approximately  with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial  consumer and real estate portfolio not including family 
this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan 
this line of credit was not drawn on during  and subsequent to december   the frb has stated that it does not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
the total amount of average borrowings was  in compared to  in and  in the general increase in the amount of borrowings that the company has had outstanding has been associated with strong loan growth that the company has experienced  which has outpaced deposit growth 
as noted in deposits above  the company expects it to be increasingly difficult to fund all loan growth with deposits 
accordingly  the company expects average borrowings to continue to increase 
additionally  in the future the company may structure a portion of its borrowings as long term depending on market conditions 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past ten years the net interest margin has not varied in any single calendar year by more than the basis point change experienced by the company in  and the lowest net interest margin realized over that same period is within basis points of the highest 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are shown as a lump sum in the period consistent with their weighted average estimated life 
as illustrated by this table  the company has million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that near term net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates 
in fact  as discussed below  management believes the opposite to be true  that the recent short term effects of a rising interest rate environment have generally had a positive impact on the company s net interest income and that the near term effects of a decrease in rates would generally have a negative effect on net interest income 
the company has relatively little long term interest rate exposure  with approximately of interest earning assets subject to repricing within five years and all interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within five years 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was and for the year of it was 
however  the fourth quarter ratio was impacted by approximately basis points and the percentage for the year was impacted by approximately basis points as a result of the company s yk liquidity plan  which called for the company to increase its short term borrowings in order to provide more immediate liquidity to fund potentially high rates of deposit withdrawals 
the and basis point amounts only consider the effects of the additional borrowings on the net interest margin and do not include the related impact on the net interest margin of pricing the company s time deposits and time deposits greater than  more aggressively in order to enhance liquidity 
the remainder of this analysis will discuss the net interest margin in terms of for the fourth quarter of and for the year of  the margins the company believes it would have experienced if not for the yk liquidity plan 
see additional discussion regarding net interest income  as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled net interest income above 
the following paragraph includes a more detailed discussion of recent changes in interest rates and the impact that they have had on the company s quarterly net interest margin 
in the fourth quarter of  the prime rate of interest decreased by basis points 
as of september  and december   although the company was liability sensitive in the months or less horizon  the company was significantly more liability sensitive in the to month horizon  which reflects maturities of the company s significant time deposit portfolio 
the primary impact of the decrease in prime rate on the company s interest earning assets was that all of the company s approximately million in adjustable rate loans as of september  immediately repriced downward by basis points 
on the interest bearing liabilities side  the component of the company s interest bearing liabilities that reprice within three months were primarily the company s low interest bearing deposits interest bearing savings  now  and money market deposits which the company was not able to reprice downward by the full basis points 
the effect of the different impact that the decrease in rates had on the company s assets and liabilities resulted in the company s net interest margin initially going down 
in the third quarter of  the company s net interest margin was  while in the fourth quarter of  the net interest margin decreased to and in the first quarter of the net interest margin further decreased to 
in the second quarter of  the company began to experience the positive effects that the repricing at lower rates of the company s time deposit portfolio had on the net interest margin 
the second quarter of net interest margin increased to 
in the third quarter of  the company continued to experience the positive effects of the time deposit repricing  and additionally the prime rate of interest increased by basis points 
the general effect of these increases in interest rates was the opposite of the negative consequences experienced from the rate cuts discussed above the company s adjustable rate loans immediately repriced by the full basis points  while the company was able to maintain a relatively static average rate paid on deposits 
these factors resulted in the company s net interest margin increasing to in the third quarter of the decrease in net interest margin to the adjusted in the fourth quarter of was largely due to a higher percentage of the company s deposits being comprised of time deposits greater than  the category of deposits that pays the highest rate of interest 
over the past six quarters  the company s net interest margin  as adjusted  has not varied from one quarter to the next by more than basis points  and the highest net interest margin over those six quarters is within basis points of the lowest net interest margin over the same time frame 
while the company can not guarantee stability in its net interest margin in the future  at this time management does not expect significant fluctuations 
however  assuming a static interest rate environment  the company does expect that its net interest margin will continue to experience gradual pressure because of continued difficulties expected in growing deposits at their historical rate spreads and at rates sufficient to fund loan growth  which could result in additional reliance on borrowings which generally carry higher rates than deposits 
see additional discussion in the section entitled deposits above 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s fixed rate earning assets have estimated fair values that are slightly lower than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being slightly lower than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios  due to a generally increasing interest rate environment at year end 
the estimated fair value of the company s time deposits is higher than its book value due to the highly competitive deposit rates the company offered in the fourth quarter of to fund loan growth and prepare for possible yk withdrawals 
off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
additionally  standby letters of credit of approximately  and  were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to credit loss for the aforementioned commitments in the event of nonperformance by the party to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
the types of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in off balance sheet derivatives activities 
return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends declared per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  liquidity the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately  line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a  overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately  line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window 
see the section above entitled borrowings for additional detail about these credit lines 
although the company has not historically had to rely on these sources of credit as a source of liquidity  the company has experienced an increase in its loan to deposit ratio over the past three years  from at december  to at december  to at december  to at december   as a result of the significant loan growth experienced 
this strong loan growth has reduced the company s liquidity sources 
beginning in the third quarter of  although the company did not have any liquidity or funding difficulties  the company began making periodic draws and repayments on its lines of credit  predominantly on an overnight basis to maintain liquidity ratios at internally targeted levels 
as noted in the section entitled deposits above  the company expects to increasingly rely on its available lines of credit in the future due to anticipation of continued difficulty in funding new loan growth solely with deposits 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs 
capital resources the company is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve board fed and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the company s banking subsidiary is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks 
the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the fed and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss  less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company  adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in fed and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company is subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the fed has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for classification as well capitalized  which are presented with the minimum ratios and the company s ratios at december   and in table although the company has continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for well capitalized status  the company s capital ratios steadily declined throughout and as a result of the strong growth the company experienced 
at december  the company s capital ratios remained approximately what they were at december  for the following reasons while the loan and deposit growth was still strong by historical standards  it was slower than in the previous two years loan growth was in compared to in and in  while deposit growth was in compared to in and in  and exercises of stock options and issuances of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan see below resulted in  being added to capital  which more than offset the  reduction in capital realized as a result of common stock repurchases see below 
although the capital ratios at december  continue to be low compared to historical levels  the company s total risk based capital to tier ii risk adjusted assets ratio of  compared to the well capitalized threshold of  is the only one of the three regulatory ratios that is within basis points of falling below the well capitalized threshold 
the company has action plans in place to improve any ratio that falls below the well capitalized threshold 
in december  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized stock repurchases for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
this authorization was designed to provide the company flexibility in managing its capital and enhance shareholder value 
under this authorization  shares are periodically purchased in the open market  at the discretion of the company  to offset share issuances under other plans or when market conditions are attractive 
in  shares of common stock were repurchased at a total cost of  or an average cost of per share 
in   shares were repurchased at a total cost of  or an average cost of per share 
prior to january  all shares needed for the dividend reinvestment plan were purchased by the administrator in the open market 
in january  the company filed the necessary documents to allow it a choice of how shares are purchased in the company s dividend reinvestment plan 
by filing the required documents  the company is allowed the option  depending on capital needs and market conditions  of selling newly issued shares into the plan at the prevailing market price 
from march through october  the company chose the option of selling newly issued shares into the plan 
a total of  shares were issued into the plan  resulting in proceeds of  or an average sales price of per share 
see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
yk issue the company successfully addressed the yk issue through implementation of a systematic  disciplined plan 
other than the time and costs involved in preparing for yk  the company is not aware of any negative consequences involving the company itself  its suppliers  or its customers as a result of the yk issue 
the company spent a total of  during and preparing for yk as follows  in the third quarter of   in the fourth quarter of   in the first quarter of   in the second quarter of   in the third quarter of and  in the fourth quarter of the yk costs noted above only include direct external costs associated with yk readiness  and do not include any amounts attributable to the significant time that management and the staff of the company spent planning  preparing and testing for yk 
the yk costs discussed in the paragraph above also do not include estimates of the monetary impact to the company s net interest income as a result of the increased liquidity called for by the company s yk plan and implemented in the fourth quarter of see discussion of the impact of these costs in the sections entitled net interest income and interest rate risk above 
although funding of the yk project costs came from normal operating cash flow  the external expenses associated with the yk issue directly reduced otherwise reported net income for the company 
inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
current accounting matters the company prepares its financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposed new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
the fasb has issued sfas no
