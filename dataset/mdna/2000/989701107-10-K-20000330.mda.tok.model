income statement analysis net interest income  margin and interest rate spreads net interest income on a tax equivalent basis is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities  with adjustments made to present income on assets exempt from income taxes comparable to other taxable income 
changes in the mix and volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  their related yields and overall interest rates have a major impact on earnings 
in  taxable equivalent net interest income provided of the company s net revenues  compared with in and in the company s taxable equivalent net interest income increased by to million in as compared to million in and million in the increased level of taxable equivalent net interest income was driven by a and growth in average earning assets for and  respectively 
the company manages its earnings sensitivity to interest rate movements  in part  by matching the repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities and  to a lesser extent  through the use of off balance sheet arrangements such as caps  floors and interest rate exchange contracts 
net interest income from the use of such off balance sheet arrangements for was million compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest income was partially offset by the continued securitization and sale of loans 
securitized loan sales convert net interest income from loans to gains on loan sales and servicing revenue reported in noninterest income 
loan sales improve the company s liquidity  limit its exposure to credit losses  and may reduce its capital requirements 
the net interest margin  the ratio of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets  was in  in and in the decrease in the margin for was primarily due to continued robust loan growth financed by short term funding sources instead of traditional core deposit growth normally experienced by the company

risk elements credit risk management management of credit risk is essential in maintaining a safe and sound institution 
the company has structured its organization to separate the lending function from the credit administration function to strengthen the control and independent evaluation of credit activities 
loan policies and procedures provide the company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions 
in addition  the company has well defined standards for grading its loan portfolio  and management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in the portfolio 
a separate internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the quality  documentation and administration of the company s lending departments  and submits reports thereon to a committee of the board of directors 
emphasis is placed on early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed on a timely basis to mitigate losses 
another aspect of the company s credit risk management strategy is the diversification of the loan portfolio 
at year end  the company had of its portfolio in loans held for sale  in commercial loans  in real estate loans  in consumer loans  and in lease financing 
the company s real estate portfolio is also diversified 
of the total portfolio  is in real estate construction loans  is in home equity credit lines  is in family residential loans and is in commercial loans secured by real estate 
the company s commercial real estate concentration is in part mitigated by its emphasis of lending programs sponsored by the small business administration  which carries the preponderance of credit risk on these types of loans 
the company also focuses on the provision of commercial real estate credit to borrowers that occupy the facility 
in addition  the company attempts to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular industry or trade group 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on concentrations of credit risk 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions 
most of the company s business activity is with customers located within the states of utah  idaho  california  colorado  arizona  nevada and washington 
also  the company does not have significant exposure to any individual customer or counterparty 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and other real estate owned 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest  unless the loan is in the process of collection and well secured 
consumer loans are not placed on a nonaccrual status  inasmuch as they are generally charged off when they become days past due 
loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments when the financial condition of the borrower deteriorates and requires that the borrower be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the credit 
other real estate owned is primarily acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure on credits secured by real estate 
the company s nonperforming assets were million on december   up from million on december  such nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases  other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets were 
on december   the same as on december  accruing loans past due days or more totaled million on december   down from million on december  these loans equaled 
of net loans and leases on december   as compared to 
on december  no loans were considered potential problem loans on december  or potential problem loans are defined as loans presently on accrual and not contractually past due days or more and not restructured  but about which management has serious doubt as to the future ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of the loans as nonperforming assets in the future 
the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans included in nonaccrual loans and leases amounted to million and million on december  and  respectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when the accrual of interest has been discontinued and meets other criteria under the statements 
the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows  the observable market price of the loan  or the fair value of the collateral 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses 
included in the allowance for loan losses on december  and  is an allowance of million and million  respectively  on million and million  respectively  of the recorded investment in impaired loans

commitments to extend credit on loans and standby letters of credit on december   and  totaled  million   million  and  million  respectively 
the company s actual future credit exposure is much lower than the contractual amounts of the commitments because a significant portion of the commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in the portfolio  and considers the results of independent internal and external credit review 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance  the company s loan and lease portfolio is broken into segments based on loan type 
historical loss experience factors by segment  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions  are used in determining the required allowance for each segment 
historical loss factors are evaluated and updated using migration analysis techniques and other considerations based on the makeup of the specific portfolio segment 
other considerations such as volumes and trends of delinquencies  nonaccruals  repossessions and bankruptcies  criticized and classified loan trends  current and anticipated foreclosure losses  new products and policies  economic conditions  concentrations of credit risk  and experience and abilities of lending personnel are also considered in establishing the loss factors 
all loans graded substandard in the amount of million or more and all credits graded doubtful in the amount of thousand or more are individually evaluated based on facts and circumstances of the loan and a specific allowance amount designated 
specific allowances may also be established for loans in amounts below the specified thresholds when it is determined that the risk differs significantly from factor amounts established for the category 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories using the methods described  the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in its entirety 
to mitigate the imprecision in most estimates of expected credit losses  the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the unallocated portion of the allowance includes management s judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and concentration risks 
accordingly  the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance for loan losses may fluctuate from period to period 
schedule provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and schedule summarizes loan loss experience

the asset liability committee alcom measures and reviews the market risk of the company and establishes policies and procedures to limit its exposure to changes in interest rates 
these policies are reviewed and approved by the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks 
alcom objectives are summarized as follows ensure the safety and soundness of bank deposits  while providing an appropriate return to shareholders  provide the basis for integrated balance sheet  net interest income and liquidity management  calculate the duration  dollar duration  and convexity of each class of assets  liabilities  and net equity given defined interest rate scenarios  manage the company s exposure to changes in net interest income and market value of equity due to interest rate fluctuations  quantify the effect of hedging instruments on the market value of equity and net interest income under defined interest rate scenarios  and identify and report any risk exposures that exceed limitations approved by the board of directors 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk regularly undertaken by the company 
this risk is monitored through the use of two complementary measurement methods equity duration and income simulation 
equity duration is derived by first calculating the dollar duration of all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet investments 
dollar duration is determined by calculating the market value of each instrument assuming interest rates sustain immediate and parallel movements up and down 
the average of these two changes in market value is the dollar duration  which incorporates the value of embedded and explicit options within each instrument 
subtracting the dollar duration of liabilities from the dollar duration of assets and adding the net dollar duration of off balance sheet items results in the dollar duration of equity 
duration of equity is computed by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the market value of equity 
income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income which would be recognized under different rate environments 
net interest income is measured under several parallel and non parallel interest rate environments and considers the possible exercise of options within the portfolio 
at year end  the company s duration of equity was estimated to be approximately years 
a basis point immediate increase in rates was estimated to increase the duration of equity to years 
conversely  an immediate decrease in rates of similar magnitude was estimated to decrease the duration of equity to years 
company policy requires that all three of these measures be between and years 
for income simulation  company policy requires that net interest income not be expected to decline by more than during one year if rates were to immediately rise or fall by basis points 
at year end  net interest income was expected to decline if interest rates were to sustain an immediate increase of basis points 
if interest rates were to similarly decline basis points  net interest income would be expected to decrease 
these estimates include management s assumptions regarding loan and deposit pricing  security and loan prepayments  and changing relationships to market rates 
management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions regarding loan and security prepayments  early deposit withdrawals  and other non controllable events in managing the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is actively managed and changes daily as the interest rate environment changes  therefore  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s position in any subsequent period 
at year end the one year gap for the company was negative million ie  the  million of assets that mature or reprice during was less than the sum of  million of liabilities and the million net effect of off balance sheet swaps that mature or reprice during the same period 
this gap represented of total assets
