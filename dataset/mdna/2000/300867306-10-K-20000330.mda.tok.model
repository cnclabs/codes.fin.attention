the company s activities during its early stages of operation focused on the development of software solutions to provide customer communications support to businesses 
in  the company began providing professional services in the areas of marketing program design and execution and data warehousing 
in march  the company ceased providing marketing program design services 
the company s development efforts culminated in the introduction to the market in july of xchange dialogue for marketing  the company s marketing automation software product

exstatic software develops and markets software products that enable businesses to plan  create and execute highly personalized  permission based email communications based on customer profiles 
in accordance with pooling of interests accounting  the results of operations have been restated to reflect the historical results of exstatic on an as combined basis 
the company generates revenue from software licenses  professional service arrangements and software maintenance agreements 
the company recognizes software license fee revenues upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if acceptance of the software by the licensee is required  revenues are only recognized upon satisfaction of the foregoing conditions and acceptance of the software 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
revenues related to software maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
although the company has experienced significant revenue growth recently  there can be no assurance that such growth rates are sustainable and they should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
in addition  the timing of license revenues is difficult to predict because of the length and variability of the company s sales cycle 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development  particularly in new and rapidly evolving markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties or that it will continue to increase revenues

the company expects to continue the expansion of its services offering to include newly identified opportunities as well as projects that require unique expertise or familiarity with the company s ecrm solution set 
in addition  as the company grows the service business associated with the hosted xchange dialogue for emessaging product it is expected that services and maintenance revenues will remain constant or increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues

the increase in cost of software license fees from to resulted from increased shipments of xchange dialogue for marketing software and  therefore  the associated royalty expense payable to third parties and costs associated with software packaging and distribution  as well as an incremental  in royalty obligations associated with the new xchange dialogue for planning module available in this increase was partially offset by the fact that the company s primary royalty obligation in and  which was payable on the first million of xchange dialogue for marketing sales  was fully satisfied by the end of the second quarter as the company adds additional components to its software products  the company may choose to license software from third parties 
the cost of such licenses may increase the cost of software license fees both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
cost of services and maintenance consists primarily of personnel  facility and system costs incurred in providing professional consulting services  training  hosted software services for the xchange dialogue for emessaging software product  and customer support services

the slight increase in cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of services and maintenance revenue from to was primarily a result of increased costs to establish the application service provider facilities necessary to deliver the xchange dialogue for emessaging hosted software business 
as the company sells more of its software products through re seller and co marketing relationships  it is anticipated that the re sellers will provide certain of the consulting and maintenance services associated with these sales 
by using the services resources of the re sellers and co marketers  the company plans to allocate its own professional services resources to direct sales customers  projects that require unique expertise or familiarity with the company s ecrm solution set  and newly identified  more profitable opportunities 
due to these items  and the continued increase in contribution from higher margin maintenance revenues and service revenues from the hosted xchange dialogue for emessaging software product  the company expects cost of services and maintenance to remain the same or decrease slightly as a percentage of both total revenues and service and maintenance revenues in the foreseeable future 
overall gross margin increased from in to in and in the increase in overall gross margin from to was attributable to the full amortization of the company s capitalized software development costs in as well as the increased contribution in from higher margin software license fee revenues

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million representing   and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
this increase in expense is primarily attributable to the increase in personnel  promotional activities including trade shows  seminars  and the development of promotional materials designed to increase awareness of the company and its ecrm solution set

as the company expands its business into new vertical markets  continues the expansion internationally into europe and the asia pacific region  and increases the market awareness of the ecrm solution offering  the company expects these expenses to remain the same or decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues due to economies of scale 
research and development

from to expenses increased in absolute dollars as the company s administrative staffing grew from employees in to in and employees in  but declined as a percentage of total revenues  due primarily to economies of scale 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues while continuing to grow in absolute dollars as a result of the implementation of additional management information systems  the continuation of the company s international expansion  and the costs that the company is incurring as a result of being a publicly held company 
cost of acquisition on august   the company acquired exstatic software  inc formerly gino borland  inc a company that develops and markets software solutions that enable businesses to plan  create and execute highly personalized  permission based email communications based on customer profiles 
total costs associated with the acquisition of million include approximately  of non cash compensation charges associated with stock options  as well as legal and accounting fees incurred by both organizations interest income expense  net the company reported net interest income of  in versus net interest income of  in as the company earned interest on increased customer cash payments as well as an incremental  of interest on the proceeds from the company s initial public offering in december net interest income increased to million in primarily as a result of interest earned on proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in december and its second public offering completed in june provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  of million  or of income before taxes 
the two primary reasons for the high effective tax rate were the million of non tax deductible acquisition costs and  of non tax deductible operating losses of exstatic software prior to the august  acquisition date included in the results of operations 
prior to its acquisition  exstatic software was structured as a sub chapter s corporation and  as such  the tax benefit of losses incurred through august  reverted to exstatic s principals 
because the acquisition was structured as a non taxable transaction for the exstatic shareholders  exchange applications does not expect to realize any tax benefit from exstatic losses incurred prior to the acquisition 
the company recorded a provision for foreign income taxes in for net operating profits earned by its united kingdom subsidiary 
however no provision was recorded for federal or state income taxes as the company incurred net domestic operating losses in the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated as a result of net operating loss carry forwards in the united states incurred prior to  as the company currently believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized

cost of revenues on a percentage basis decreased throughout the quarters presented as a result of an increase in software license fees in the company s revenue mix and the completion of software royalty obligations in the second quarter of no assurances can be given that the favorable shift in revenue mix will continue 
gross profit for any quarter will be affected by the revenue mix in that quarter 
operating expenses have increased in each of the quarters presented 
sales and marketing expenses have increased as a result of increased sales and marketing personnel and increased commissions associated with higher revenues 
research and development expenses generally have increased as a result of continued enhancements to the ecrm product offerings  including xchange dialogue for marketing  as well as the xchange real time  xchange optimizer  and xchange dialogue for emessaging software products 
general and administrative expenses have increased primarily due to additional personnel  professional fees and facilities and other infrastructure costs 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as predictors of future performance 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities in private placements  the issuance of notes payable to related parties  and the sales of common stock as part of its initial public stock offering in december and its secondary public stock offering in june in june  the company modified the terms of its revolving note agreement with fleet national bank  increasing the credit limit from million to million

in addition  the company is prohibited from paying any cash dividends on its common stock under the revolving note agreement 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the revolving note agreement with the exception of the quarterly net income requirement for the quarterly period ended september   and had received a waiver from the bank for that instance of non compliance 
as a result of the microstrategy transaction  the company expects to not be profitable for the foreseeable future and as such will be requesting a modification to the appropriate covenants under the revolving note agreement 
as of december  the company had million in cash and short term and long term investments 
the company believes that its existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and anticipated capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  the company may require additional sources of funds to continue to support its business 
there can be no assurance that such capital  if needed  will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  increased million from december  net cash provided by operations in of approximately million resulted primarily from net income before depreciation expense and non cash option related compensation expense of million and an approximately  decrease in non cash working capital 
the decrease in non cash working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable associated with increased license and services revenue in versus  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities in totaled million 
net cash used resulted from property and equipment purchases totaling million related to the increase in headcount  the expansion of the main operating facilities and the acquisition of computer hardware and software for development and internal operating systems

the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  to reduce future income taxes  if any 
these carryforwards expire through and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that the company may utilize in any one year in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of as defined 
the company believes that it has experienced a change in ownership in excess of 
the company does not believe that this change will significantly impact the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards 
the company currently has sales offices in the united kingdom and australia  in addition to the united states 
the company s revenues from international operations have been denominated in foreign currencies which historically have been stable in relation to us dollars 
as a result  the gain or loss from foreign currency transactions has not been material to the company s operating results 
as of december   the material assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies include accounts receivable  accounts payable and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the stability of the foreign economies where these assets and liabilities are denominated  the company has not adopted a policy of hedging foreign currency risks 
while it is anticipated that foreign transactions will continue to be denominated in local currencies  the company expects to use hedging instruments to offset potential currency exposures arising as the company s international operations expand into less stable economic environments

risk factors statements in this report concerning the future results of operations  financial condition and business of the company are forward looking statements as defined in the securities act of and the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that information contained in these forward looking statements is inherently uncertain  and that actual performance and results may differ materially due to numerous risk factors  including but not limited to the following our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult 
we began commercial shipment of the initial xchange dialogue for marketing product in july we were not a separate company until november accordingly  we have only a limited operating history for you to evaluate our business 
you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties that an early stage company like ours faces 
these risks include our ability to o successfully respond to competitive developments  o continue to upgrade our products and service offerings  and o continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
recent transactions will result in short term losses 
as a result of the expenses associated with recent transactions with microstrategy inc  we will report quarterly and annual operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance 
moreover  our operating results may fall below market analysts expectations in some future quarters 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our business may suffer if new customers do not accept our solutions 
we currently derive all of our revenues from xchange dialogue for marketing licenses  xchange dialogue for emessaging licenses and services related to our ecrm solution 
we anticipate that these sources will continue to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business will suffer if the market does not accept our solutions and our future enhancements of these solutions 
if demand for our solutions drops as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  our business could be substantially harmed 
the market for ecrm applications is still emerging and it may not continue to grow 
even if the market does grow  businesses may not adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers about customer optimization software and services in general and about the features and functions of our products and services in particular 
however  our solutions may not achieve any additional degree of market acceptance 
if the market for our solutions fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business would be materially harmed 
we depend on a few industries for most of our sales  and we may not be successful in expanding beyond those limited markets 
a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from sales to telecommunications companies and financial institutions  including retail banks  credit card issuers and mutual fund companies 
we may not continue to be successful in these markets 
in addition  we may not be successful in achieving significant market acceptance in other markets that we target 
the loss of one of our largest customers could cause our revenues to drop quickly and unexpectedly 
in fiscal and  our top five customers accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to do business with us  that business from existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that we will be able to do a significant amount of business with new customers 
if we lose one of our customers  our revenues could drop more quickly than we could reduce expenses 
this could substantially harm our financial results 
we need to manage our growth effectively or we may not succeed 
we have grown rapidly  with total revenues increasing from million in  to million in  to million in and we recorded million in the number of our employees has increased from at december  to at december  and to at december  our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers have also experienced substantial growth over this period 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems  and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
our failure to expand and integrate these areas in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow  our revenues to decline or to grow more slowly than expected  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we lose our key personnel  or fail to attract and retain additional personnel  our business and growth may suffer 
our future success depends on the continued services of a relatively small number of key technical and senior management personnel  including andrew j 
frawley  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  david g 
mcfarlane  our chief operating officer  and michael d 
mcgonagle  our chief technology officer  none of whom presently has an employment contract with us 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for these people is intense  and we have at times in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
the loss of any member of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business will not grow if we do not keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
because the market for our software products is rapidly changing  our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to enhance our current product line 
we also must develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  fully functional product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by others  our business will not grow and our financial results will suffer 
in particular  our business could be harmed by o any significant errors or bugs in our software shipped to customers  o any delay by customers in making purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced products  o significant delays in the general availability of our new products or releases  o significant problems in the installation or implementation of our new products or releases  or o customer dissatisfaction with our new products or releases 
our stock price or our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to efficiently integrate acquisitions 
we may pursue acquisitions that could provide new technologies  products or service offerings 
future acquisitions by us may involve potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 
we also may incur substantial additional liabilities and expenses  such as debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if any of these occur  the market price of our common stock and our financial results could suffer 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including o difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  o the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and o the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
if we are not successful integrating acquisitions  it could increase our expenses and harm our business 
competition could reduce our market share and harm our business 
our competitors may be able to develop products and services that are more attractive to businesses than our products and services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they also may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than us 
if these companies introduce products and services that effectively competed with our products and services  they could be in a position to charge lower prices or to bundle their products and services with their other products and services 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change and competitors innovations 
if we cannot compete successfully with existing or new competitors  we may have to reduce prices on our products  which could lead to reduced profits 
we could also lose market share  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
if we do not successfully maintain our relationships with indirect distribution channels  our sales could decline or could grow more slowly than expected 
we expect to increase the amount of our products that we distribute through various indirect channels 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our distribution partners will be successful in distributing our products 
we rely on the marketing and sales efforts of these organizations  many of whom also market and sell competitive products 
the loss of one or more of our relationships with these organizations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract organizations that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
none of our agreements governing the re seller or co marketing relationships with these organizations includes any commitments on the part of these organizations to effect any minimum number of sales of our products  or otherwise to provide us with business 
if revenues arising from our relationships with these organizations do not exceed historical levels  our business will not grow as expected 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and others could infringe on or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
the number of intellectual property claims may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
if we do not successfully grow and manage our international operations  our business will suffer 
we have operations in a number of foreign markets 
we currently have customers in more than countries 
we believe that we must expand our sales in international markets in order for our business to grow as planned 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations and hire additional personnel 
if we are unable to do so in a timely and effective manner  our growth in international sales will be limited  and our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have begun to translate our products into different languages and character sets  which may be more difficult or expensive to complete than expected 
in addition  other markets may have longer selling cycles and different product requirements than the united states and we may not be able to successfully adapt our products and methods 
our international operations are also subject to the risks inherent in any international business activities  including  in particular o management of an organization spread over various countries  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  o compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o overlap of different tax structures  and o general economic conditions 
currency fluctuations and general economic conditions in our foreign markets may impact our customers spending and the value of money owed to us 
we have made substantial sales to international customers in canada  denmark  germany  the netherlands  sweden  the united kingdom and china 
our revenues from international operations have been denominated in foreign currencies which historically have been relatively stable in relation to us dollars 
as a result  we have not adopted a policy of hedging foreign currency risks 
if economic conditions in our target markets decline  currencies could fluctuate relative to the us dollar  and our customers could reduce their information technology spending 
our founders  officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over our voting stock and have the ability to make decisions that could adversely affect our stock price 
as of january   our current officers  directors and principal stockholders held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
consequently  this group will be able to control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including the election of members to our board of directors and the approval of significant change in control transactions  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
representatives of the existing stockholders constitute all five directors and will therefore have significant influence in directing the actions of the board of directors 
we have not identified candidates for additional positions on the board of directors 
we may be subject to future product liability claims 
while our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we may be subject to claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  defending these claims  regardless of merit  could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel 
year problems may disrupt our business 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as of january   these date code fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with these year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with the failure to comply with these requirements 
any failure of third party equipment or software comprising any part of our systems to operate properly due to year problems could require us to incur unanticipated expenses to address associated problems  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
year issues may affect the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to replace or remedy their current hardware and software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those we offer 
we believe  based on an internal assessment  that the current versions of our software products are year compliant 
however  our products are generally integrated with enterprise systems and other products of our customers developed by other vendors 
year problems in these systems and products might significantly limit the ability of our customers to realize the intended benefits offered by our products and services 
we have no plan to determine whether the internal systems and products of our customers are year compliant 
we may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although we have not been involved in any litigation or proceeding to date involving our products or services related to year issues  we may be required in the future to defend our products or services or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liabilities for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our common stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the market for securities of most high technology companies  including our common stock  has been highly volatile 
it is likely that the market price of the common stock will continue to fluctuate widely in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include o responses to quarter to quarter variations in our results of operations  o the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  o technological innovation by us or our competitors  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
we have adopted anti takeover provisions that could affect the market price of our common stock or our ability to sell our business 
certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock incentive plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a sale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency treasury bills and notes with an average maturity of less then twelve months 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
foreign currency exchange risk 
with sales and services offices in the united states  united kingdom and australia  and a global customer base  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposure has been nondollar denominated operating expenses and sales by its united kingdom subsidiary 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union  of which the united kingdom is not a member  occurred in january to date  the company has not seen any impact of the euro on foreign exchange exposure 
in addition  as the company expands its sales and service presence in the asia pacific region in  its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks from the more volatile economies of this region will increase 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the british sterling  euro  or other foreign currency if the exposure becomes material 
as of december  the company s material nondollar denominated assets and liabilities primarily consisted of cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in british sterling and australian dollars
