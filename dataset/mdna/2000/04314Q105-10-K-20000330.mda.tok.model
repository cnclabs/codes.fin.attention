item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview the company was incorporated in delaware in november as neurotec international corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of neurotec gmbh  a german multimedia and internet solutions company owned by eberhard schoneburg  artificial life s president  chief executive officer and chairman  and two corporate investors a major german retailer and an industrial conglomerate 
in july  mr 
schoneburg sold all of his shares of neurotec gmbh to the two remaining stockholders and contemporaneously purchased of the shares of neurotec international corp 
the management buyout 
in august  the company changed its name to artificial life  inc as a result of a change in control of the company in connection with the management buyout  the company has presented its assets and liabilities subsequent to july  to reflect the purchase price paid for the stock of the company 
this treatment is consistent with push down accounting as promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the results of operations for the company for have been separately presented to reflect the results of operations prior to the management buyout  as predecessor operations  and for the period subsequent to the management buyout  as successor operations 
in management s opinion  the purchase price of the company s stock in the management buyout reflected the fair value of the company at such time 
the difference between the company s net book value at july  and the fair value has been recorded as a reduction of the company s net deferred tax asset and long term assets  resulting in a new depreciation basis for financial statement purposes for such assets 
as of july   the stockholder s equity section reflects cumulative earnings prior to the management buyout as paid in capital 
as a result  accumulated deficit at december  reflects the results of operations of the company only from the date of the management buyout 
the only difference in accounting policies utilized in the presentation of the successor and predecessor financial statements is the estimated useful lives utilized in the depreciation of property and equipment  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
following the management buyout  the company s management made the strategic decision to shift the company s primary business focus from providing software consulting services to the development  marketing and support of its alife suite of smartbot software products 
management s decision to shift the primary business focus of the company has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the near term 
the company expects that an increasing percentage of its future revenues will be derived from sales and services associated with its smartbot software products and that revenues from its consulting business  as a percentage of gross revenues  will significantly decrease over time 
through  the company s major source of revenue has been its software consulting services  and it generated minimal revenue from the sale of its smartbot software products 
however  in the company realized its first significant software license revenue 
the company continues to expand its research and development  production and marketing capabilities associated with the anticipated sale of its smartbot products  and as a result  operating expenses are expected to increase significantly going forward 
the company expects to continue to incur increasing losses and generate negative cash flow from operations until at least the year to the extent that the company s product development  marketing and sales efforts do not result in commercially successful products that generate significant net revenues  the company will be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate sufficient revenues from the sale of the company s products or associated services to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  as a result of the company s transition in its primary business focus from software consulting to product development  marketing and support  the company s research and development expenditures  excluding amounts included in capitalized software development costs  increased from zero in to  in and  in this increase is due to the fact that prior to  all research and development expenditures were related to consulting services for which the company was reimbursed by its customers and thus  such expenditures are included in engineering expenses in the company s financial statements through december  conversely  during  due to the company s shift in business focus  the company had the majority of its employees engaged in the research and development of its smartbot products 
because the company has shifted its primary business focus from software consulting to product development  marketing and support  results of operations to date are not reflective of the company s business prospects going forward 
moreover  the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in its future operating results due to a variety of factors 
factors that may affect the company s operating results include the success of product development  the amount of software consulting undertaken in the future  market acceptance of the company s products  frequency and timeliness of new product releases  success of strategic alliances  the mix of product and service sales  the company s response to competitive pressure and its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
gross profit margins will vary from product to product and between products and services and although the company may have some ability to affect its products and services mix  the company s sales mix may vary from period to period and its gross margins will fluctuate accordingly 
results of operations fiscal realized the first significant software license revenues in company history 
this is consistent with the company s business strategy as changed to reflect its focus on product development and license sales 
the company s principal source of revenue from inception through may was from the provision of software consulting services 
from inception through july   the preponderance of those revenues were generated by subcontracts issued from artificial life s former parent company and affiliates thereof  all of which revenues ceased shortly after the management buyout 
of the non related party revenues  most were derived from the company s long term consulting contract with its major domestic client 
this consulting contract started in late and concluded in may during the fourth quarter of  the company began evaluating the addition of software product development to its core business of providing software consulting services 
the company commenced software development plans while it continued to provide software consulting services under its existing contracts and to seek new consulting contracts 
in the first quarter of  the company began software development activities while continuing to service its one existing consulting contract 
during this time the company limited its efforts in seeking new consulting contracts as it began to shift its primary business focus to software development 
during the second quarter of  when the company s major domestic consulting contract ended  the company focused a substantial portion of its available resources on product development 
this change in focus resulted in the company  in fiscal  realizing its first significant software license revenue
