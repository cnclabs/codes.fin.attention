income taxes 
income tax expense increased approximately million or from an approximate  in to approximately million in the increase in expense is attributable to increased pre tax income and the full year impact of the non deductible goodwill amortization expense related to the strato acquisition 
it should be noted that the expense was also lower due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for which there previously had been a full valuation allowance 
these carryforwards were fully utilized in quarterly results the following table sets forth quarterly statement of operations data for and this quarterly information is unaudited but has been prepared on a basis consistent with the company s audited financial statements presented elsewhere herein and  in the company s opinion  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the company restated its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended june  and the three and nine months ended september  the restatement was necessary due to errors in inventory valuation and recognition of cost of goods sold discovered during the fourth quarter relating to previous periods 
the adjustment resulted in the following changes shown on the table below for the three months ended june and september  three months ended march  june  september  december  in thousands  except per share data net sales     costs of good sold     gross profit     selling  general and administrative expenses     operating income     interest expense  net  other income income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item   income tax expense income loss before extraordinary items extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of put feature  extraordinary losses on early extinguishments of debt  net of income tax benefit of  net income net income loss per share before extraordinary item basic and diluted 



net income per share basic and diluted 



three months ended march  june  september  december  as reported as restated as reported as restated in thousands  except per share data net sales       costs of good sold       gross profit       selling  general and administrative expenses 
      operating income      interest expense  net      other income income loss before income taxes    income tax expense net income net income per share basic and diluted liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures for its existing facility and to fund new business acquisitions 
historically  the company has used cash generated by operations  bank financing  and  in  proceeds from its public equity offering to fund its capital requirements 
additionally  the company requires capital to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on its production volume  the timing of shipments and the payment terms offered to its customers 
net cash provided by used in operations was approximately million in  as compared with approximately million and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from operations during was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels as well as the reduction of accounts payable and income taxes payable 
the company granted extended payment terms to several of its larger distributors in  which in conjunction with increased sales volume  contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million during  as compared with approximately million and million in and  respectively 
substantially all of the investing activities in were for additional cash paid for acquisitions and for capital expenditures 
cash paid for acquisitions was approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company has established a capital expenditure budget in of approximately million  primarily for leasehold improvements and manufacturing and office equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  as compared with approximately million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities in include  provided by additional borrowings under the company s credit facility to fund operations and approximately  used for principal payments on long term debt 
in  the proceeds from the company s initial public offering were used to repay the company s existing debt of approximately million that was outstanding  purchase the company s office in atlanta  georgia  and fund the acquisition of norfolk 
in  the borrowings of million were used to fund business expansion through the acquisition of strato  to retire approximately million of existing debt and to purchase warrants issued in connection with a previous debt agreement for a price of  as previously noted  the company s previous credit facility and certain other indebtedness were repaid during with proceeds from the ipo as was required by the respective agreements 
on may   the company entered into a million amended and restated credit facility the new credit facility with banc of america to be used for working capital purposes and to fund future acquisitions 
the new credit facility bears interest at a rate to be selected by the company from certain options defined in the agreement 
at december   the company s interest rate was  compared with at december  portions of the amounts outstanding under the new credit facility are payable in quarterly installments beginning october  in amounts representing of the principal amounts outstanding on the payment due dates 
the remaining portion is due on the date of the expiration of the new credit facility  which is july  the total balance outstanding under the new credit facility was approximately million and no funds were available for borrowing under the new credit facility at december  in addition  the company had outstanding standby letters of credit at december  of approximately million  which collateralize the company s obligations to third parties in connection with its acquisitions 
the company s new credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that require a minimum net worth and ebitda as well as specific ratios such as total debt service coverage  leverage  interest coverage and debt to capitalization 
the covenants also place limitations on capital expenditures  other borrowings  operating lease arrangements  and affiliate transactions 
the company is in compliance with or has received appropriate waivers of these covenants as of the date of this filing 
the new credit facility is described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements of the company included elsewhere in this form k 
the company and banc of america amended the new credit facility on march  and march   to adjust certain of the financial ratio covenants and increase the interest rate 
the company is currently negotiating with various lenders to refinance the existing senior indebtedness and to provide new subordinate debt or equity investment  which  together with its cash flows from operations  the company believes will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the new credit facility costs result primarily from interest and principal and are not affected by inflation 
further  although the company often sells products on a fixed cost basis  the average time between the receipt of any order and delivery is generally only a few days 
while the company has not historically been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials and components  several gpo agreements to which the company is a party limit the company s ability to raise prices 
thus  future increases in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
this could change in situations in which the company is producing against a substantial backlog and may not be able to pass on higher costs to customers 
in addition  interest on a portion of the company s debt is variable approximately million is subject to an interest rate cap and therefore may increase with inflation 
the company makes all sales of foreign customers in us dollars 
thus  notwithstanding fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates  the company s profit margin for any purchase order is not subject to change due to exchange rate fluctuations after the time the order is placed 
year disclosure the company previously recognized the material nature of the business issues surrounding computer processing of dates into and beyond the year and began taking corrective action 
the company s efforts included replacing and testing four basic aspects of its business operations internal information technology it systems  including sales order processing  contract management  financial systems and service management  internal non it systems  including office equipment and test equipment products  building infrastructure  including heating and cooling systems  security systems  water  gas and electric  and material third party relationships 
management believes the company has completed all of the activities within its control to ensure that the company s systems are year compliant  and the company has experienced no interruptions to normal operations due to the start of the year the company s year readiness costs were not material and were incurred and recorded as normal operating costs 
the company funded these costs through funds generated from operations and such costs were generally not incremental to existing it budgets  internal resources were re deployed and timetables for implementation of replacement systems were accelerated 
the company does not currently expect to apply any further funds to address year issues 
as of march   the company has not experienced any material disruptions of its internal computer systems or software applications  and has not experienced any problems with the computer systems or software applications of its third party venders  suppliers or service providers 
the company will continue to monitor these third parties to determine the impact  if any  on the business of the company and the actions the company must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
based upon the company s assessment of compliance by third parties  there appears to be no material business risk posed by any such noncompliance 
moreover  the company generally believes that the vendors that supply products to the company for resale are responsible for the products year functionality 
although the company s year rollover did not present any material business disruption  there are some remaining year related risks  including risks due to the fact that the year is a leap year 
these risks include potential product supply issues and other non operational issues 
management believes that appropriate action has been taken to address these remaining year issues and contingency plans are in place to minimize the financial impact to the company 
management  however  cannot be certain that year issues will not have a material adverse impact on the company  since the evaluation process is not yet complete and it is early in the year recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires all derivatives to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in such fair value are required to be recognized immediately in net income loss to the extent the derivatives are not effective as hedges 
in september  the financial standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment to delay the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors limited manufacturing experience the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with international and domestic standards such as iso  the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and other applicable licensing and regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
the company has historically outsourced the manufacturing of most of its product lines to third parties while remaining responsible for that work 
in the fourth quarter of  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its circle c r and pheres flow tm specialty catheter product lines into its manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its lifeport tm  infuse a port r and infuse a cath r product lines to the manchester facility from a facility in norwood  massachusetts 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the vortex tm  titanport tm and omegaport r product lines to the manchester facility from norfolk medical 
the company has undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular gmp inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
the company s success will depend  among other things  on its ability to efficiently manufacture different products and to integrate newly acquired products with existing products 
the company s failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of new products  to maintain or increase production volumes of new or existing products in a timely or cost effective manner or to maintain compliance with iso  the ce mark requirements  gmp regulations or other applicable licensing or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has limited experience in managing the manufacturing process for the ifm product line 
if the company should assume or acquire manufacturing responsibility for that product line  the company s success will depend on  among other things  successfully acquiring current plant management and successfully producing the ifm product line 
management of growth  risks associated with acquisitions the rapid growth experienced by the company to date has placed  and could continue to place  significant demands on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
from time to time  the company may pursue additional strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies as a means of expanding its existing product lines and distribution channels 
as the medical devices industry continues to consolidate  the company expects to face increasing competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that financing for such acquisitions will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the company or that such acquisitions will be successfully completed 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  iii responsibility for undiscovered or contingent liabilities and iv loss of key employees of acquired operations 
the relocation of manufacturing operations for acquired product lines to the company s manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia may also result in interruptions in production and back orders 
no assurance can be given that the company will not incur problems in integrating any future acquisition and there can be no assurance that any future acquisition will increase the company s profitability 
further  the company s results of operations in fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition may be materially adversely affected while the company integrates the acquired business into its existing operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time charges and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
manufacturing relationships while the company believes it has a good relationship with each third party that manufactures the company s products  there can be no assurance that such relationships will not deteriorate in the future 
deterioration in these manufacturing relationships could cause the company to experience interruptions in its manufacturing and delivery processes and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  when the manufacturing arrangements with these third parties expire  the company will have to make other manufacturing arrangements or manufacture products at company facilities 
the failure to effectively plan for the expiration of these agreements could also result in interruption of the manufacturing and delivery processes for these products and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is in default under its manufacturing agreement with ifm 
see item business acquisitions above 
should the company be unable to revise the manufacturing agreement to include acceptable terms or fail to continue to operate under the verbal modification to the manufacturing agreement  then any liabilities incurred as a result of the default could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position and disrupt the company s ability to obtain and sell the products 
dependence on patents  trademarks  licenses and proprietary rights the company believes that its competitive position and success has depended  in part  on and will continue to depend on the ability of the company and its licensors to obtain patent protection for its products  to defend patents once obtained  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
the company s policy is to protect its proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications relating to technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign patents and united states and foreign patent applications 
the company also is a party to license agreements with third parties pursuant to which it has obtained  for varying terms  the right to make  use and or sell products that are covered under such license agreement in consideration for royalty payments 
many of the company s major products are subject to such license agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company or its licensors have or will develop or obtain additional rights to products or processes that are patentable  that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications filed by the company or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect any technology that is licensed to the company 
in addition  no assurances can be given that any patents issued or licensed to the company or other licensing arrangements will not be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages for the company s business or products 
in such event the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company could be materially adversely affected 
a number of medical device companies  physicians and others have filed patent applications or received patents to technologies that are similar to technologies owned or licensed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company is aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect the company s ability to make  use or sell its products 
united states patent applications are confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office pto  and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six or more months after filing 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned or licensed by the company and limit the ability of the company or its licensors to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims  the company may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would not be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development or commercialization of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical devices industry 
although the company has not been a party to any material litigation to enforce any intellectual property rights held by the company  or a party to any material litigation seeking to enforce any rights alleged to be held by others  future litigation may be necessary to protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using certain of its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology that it seeks to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for the development and protection of brand loyalty and associated goodwill in connection with its products 
the company s policy is to protect its trademarks  trade names and associated goodwill by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign trademark applications relating to its products and business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign trademark registrations and applications 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for which it does not have pending trademark applications or existing registrations  but in which the company has substantial trademark rights 
the company s registered and unregistered trademark rights relate to the majority of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names of the company will not be challenged  canceled  infringed  circumvented  or be declared generic or infringing of other third party marks or provide any competitive advantage to the company 
potential product liability because its products are intended to be used in healthcare settings on patients who are physiologically unstable and may be seriously or critically ill  the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the medical devices industry 
in addition  many of the medical devices manufactured and sold by the company are designed to be implanted in the human body for extended periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks with respect to these or other products manufactured or sold by the company could result in injury to  or death of  a patient 
the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  safety alert relating to  or other fda or private civil action affecting one or more of the company s products or responsible officials 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in amounts that it deems sufficient for its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such coverage will be available with respect to or sufficient to satisfy all claims made against the company or that the company will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could result in costly litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the company initiated a voluntary product recall of its dialysis and central venous catheter kit product lines due to small pinholes in the product packaging 
although the recall covers products manufactured since  product returns through december  were approximately  units 
no product complaints have been received to date for either pinholes in the packaging or infection of the implant site that could be attributed to the packaging being contaminated 
the product recall will remain open with fda until the reconciliation to shipments has been completed and a recall termination request has been approved 
future capital requirements there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow from operations and cash available from external financing will be sufficient to meet the company s future cash flow needs  in which case the company would need to obtain additional financing 
the company currently has no availability of funds under the new credit facility 
any additional financing could involve issuances of debt or issuances of equity securities which would be dilutive to the company s stockholders  and any debt facilities could contain covenants that may affect the company s operations  including its ability to make future acquisitions 
adequate additional funds  whether from the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
insufficient funds may cause the company difficulty in financing its accounts receivables and inventory and may result in delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s product acquisition  licensing  marketing or research and development programs or opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
new product introductions although the vascular access product industry has not experienced rapid technological change historically  as the company s existing products become more mature  the importance of developing or acquiring  manufacturing and introducing new products that address the needs of its customers will increase 
the development or acquisition of any such products will entail considerable time and expense  including acquisition costs  research and development costs  and the time and expense required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  which approvals are not assured  and any of which could adversely affect the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
there can be no assurance that such development activities will yield products that can be commercialized profitably or that any product acquisition can be consummated on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to date  substantially all of the company s products have been developed in conjunction with third parties or acquired as a result of acquisitions consummated by the company 
the inability of the company to develop or acquire new products to supplement the company s existing product lines could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to fully implement its business strategy and further develop its operation 
customer concentration the company s net sales to its three largest customers accounted for  and of total sales during  and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant curtailments of purchases by  any of the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key suppliers the company purchases raw materials and components for use in manufacturing its products from many different suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing supplier relationships or secure additional suppliers as needed 
in addition  stepic has generated of its sales through distribution of products of three major manufacturers

management of the company is monitoring possible year issues and is seeking to avoid any problems

healthcare reform pricing pressure the healthcare industry in the united states continues to experience change 
in recent years  several healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by members of congress 
in addition  state legislatures periodically consider healthcare reform proposals 
federal  state and local government representatives will  in all likelihood  continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies  and ongoing public debate of these issues can be expected 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors to persons providing medical services 
in particular  the healthcare industry is experiencing market driven reforms from forces within the industry that are exerting pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs 
managed care and other healthcare provider organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population in the united states that receives medical benefits through such organizations and in terms of the influence and control that they are able to exert over an increasingly large portion of the healthcare industry 
managed care organizations are continuing to consolidate and grow  increasing the ability of these organizations to influence the practices and pricing involved in the purchase of medical devices  including certain of the products sold by the company  which is expected to exert downward pressure on product margins 
both short and long term cost containment pressures  as well as the possibility of continued regulatory reform  may have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation the company s products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including  but not limited to  the fda and state and foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  the company must obtain specific clearance or approval from the fda before it can market new products or certain modified products in the united states 
the fda administers the fdc act 
under the fdc act  medical devices must receive fda clearance through the section k notification process k or the more lengthy pma process before they can be sold in the united states 
to obtain k marketing clearance  a company must show that a new product is substantially equivalent to a product already legally marketed and which does not require a pma 
therefore  it is not always necessary to prove the safety and effectiveness of the new product in order to obtain k clearance for such product 
to obtain a pma  a company must submit extensive data  including clinical trial data  to prove the safety  effectiveness and clinical utility of its products 
fda regulations also require companies to adhere to certain gmp s  which include testing  quality control  storage  and documentation procedures 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic site inspections by the fda 
the process of obtaining such clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that all clearances or approvals sought by the company will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
in addition  the company is required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion of its products 
the federal trade commission also regulates most device advertising 
in addition  international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing product testing and licensing standards  manufacturing compliance eg  compliance with iso standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements and pricing and reimbursement levels 
the inability or failure of the company to comply with the varying regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the company s ability to sell its products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations could subject the company to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  product seizures  injunctions  recalls  suspensions or withdrawal of clearances or approvals  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions against the company or its responsible officials  any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory agencies 
no assurance can be given that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  the company has received section fd and warning letters from the fda regarding the company s compliance with fda regulations 
the company has worked with the fda to resolve these issues 
there can be no assurance the company will not receive additional fd s or warning letters in the future or that it will be able to reach an acceptable resolution of the issues raised in such letters 
limitations on third party reimbursement in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by hospitals and medical clinics  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the healthcare services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group drg established by the united states health care financing administration hcfa 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
reimbursement of procedures implanting the company s vascular access ports and catheter products is currently covered under a drg 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such implantation will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of third party payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the medical devices industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company currently competes with many companies in the development  manufacturing and marketing of vascular access ports  dialysis and apheresis catheters and related ancillary products and in the distribution of medical devices 
some of these competitors have substantially greater capital resources  management resources  research and development staffs  sales and marketing organizations and experience in the medical devices industry than the company 
these competitors may succeed in marketing their products more effectively  pricing their products more competitively  or developing technologies and products that are more effective than those sold or produced by the company or that would render some products offered by the company noncompetitive 
factors inhibiting takeover certain provisions of the articles and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in its best interest 
among other things  these provisions establish certain advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings  provide for the classification of the board of directors  provide that only the board of directors or shareholders owning or more of the outstanding common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders and establish supermajority voting requirements with respect to the amendment of certain provisions of the articles and bylaws 
in addition  the board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  no par value the preferred stock  issuable in one or more series  with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of the common stock 
the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the company s consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of all or substantially all of its assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of such stock 
furthermore  certain provisions of the georgia business corporation code may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
deterioration in general economic conditions the sales of the products manufactured and distributed by the company may be adversely impacted by a deterioration in the general economic conditions in the markets in which the company s products are sold 
likewise  a deterioration in general economic conditions could cause the company s customers and or third party payors to choose cheaper methods of treatment not utilizing the company s products 
a decline in the company s sales attributable to these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
