the derivatives the company uses are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis 
the company identifies all of its known exposures 
as part of that process  all natural hedges are identified 
the company then nets these natural hedges from its gross exposures 
the company s consolidated earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  its overall exposure to such fluctuations is reduced by the diversity of its foreign operating locations which encompass a number of different european locations  canada and china 
the company s foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar

the company purchases significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod and cast iron which are utilized in manufacturing its many product lines 
the company s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if it is unable to pass on related price increases to its customers

additionally  on a limited basis  the company uses commodity futures contracts to manage this risk
