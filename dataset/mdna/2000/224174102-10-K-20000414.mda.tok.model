since most of the screens added in were opened late in the year  neither their revenues nor expenses are fully reflected in the company s results of operations 
also  it is anticipated that the costs of operation for these new cinemas will be higher during their initial operation than on a normalized basis  due to the higher staffing and advertising costs typically associated with a new cinema 
going forward  reading has determined to focus its efforts on the australian and new zealand markets 
reading opened an screen complex in australia in march and anticipates opening an additional screen complex in australia in the third quarter of at the present time  there are no plans to expand the puerto rican circuit and plans to open only a single additional cinema in the united states in ultimately  reading intends to phase out of the exhibition business domestically and in puerto rico

the reorganization and stock transactions reading entertainment inc  a nevada corporation  was initially formed in in a reorganization of the company under a delaware holding company 
in  rei was reincorporated a nevada corporation 
the consolidated company believes that such a structure would facilitate the financing of reading  by permitting it to seek new capital without subjecting the new capital to the contingent liabilities of reading s historical railroad business  and permit reading to avail itself of a more established body of corporate law that that of pennsylvania 
pursuant to the stock transactions  rei received  of cash from citadel 
in return rei issued to citadel   in stated value  shares of rei s series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require rei to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of rei common stock at any time through a date days after rei files its annual report on form k 
citadel has informed reading it does not intend to exercise the asset put option 
rei received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of  the chc preferred stock with a stated value of  and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
certain financial reporting and tax considerations the reorganization and the stock transactions have been accounted for as a purchase 
the book value of the assets transferred by craig to rei were as follows citadel preferred stock  stater bros 
preferred stock  ownership interest in reading international  gross book value of assets received  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the stock transactions were intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code with no taxable gain recognized in the transaction 
accordingly  rei s tax basis in the acquired assets was the same as craig s basis in those assets had been immediately before the contribution 
the stater bros 
stock was the only asset which  at the time of the transaction  had a market value substantially in excess of the tax basis 
in december  the stater preferred stock was contributed by rei to reading australia 
management believes that the gain for federal tax purposes resulting from that transfer was offset by rei s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of rei has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of rei 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to rei s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed property 
although the consolidated company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols applied to the contribution by rei of the stater preferred stock to reading australia  there can be no assurance that the irs will not take a different position 
the irs is presently examining reading s tax return in which the company utilized  of the nol 
if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the consolidated company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the consolidated company could be materially adversely affected 
rei issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the series a preferred stock issued to citadel has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if rei fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
effects on inflation the consolidated company continually monitors inflation and the effects of changing prices

competitive conditions in the market  however  restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of doing business during inflationary periods 
the effects of inflation have  in the management s opinion  been managed appropriately

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the financial performance and results of operations of the consolidated company may be affected by changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and inflation 
the consolidated company maintains most of its cash and cash equivalent balances in eurodollar time deposits and short term money market instruments with original maturities of six months or less 
eurodollar time deposits are not readily marketable and therefore are not subject to interest rate risk  although the consolidated company may lose the ability to realize the benefit of increased interest income if interest rates were to rise 
other money market investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short term nature of such investments  a change of in short term interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
approximately and of the consolidated company s net assets assets less liabilities were invested in assets denominated in australian dollars reading australia and new zealand dollars reading new zealand  respectively  at december  the consolidated company anticipates expenditure of its remaining cash balances in in furtherance of its development activities and has therefore converted portions of its cash funds to australian and new zealand dollars 
at december    of the cash and cash equivalents were invested in australian and new zealand dollars compared to  for the prior year 
upon the expenditure of the remaining cash balances  it is expected that funding for development expenditures will be secured through bank borrowings 
such borrowings will be originated in the same currencies as the expenditures 
accordingly  unless the reading elects to hedge its foreign exchange exposure  a significant portion of reading s net assets based upon the amount at december  will continue to be invested in assets subject to exchange fluctuations between the us  australian  and new zealand dollars 
at december   approximately of the reading s net assets were invested in assets subject to currency fluctuations 
reading has no current plan to hedge such exposure
