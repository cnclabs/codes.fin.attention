item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ultratech develops  manufactures and markets photolithography equipment steppers designed to reduce the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits  thin film heads for disk drives and micromachined components 
the company supplies step and repeat systems based on one to one and reduction optical technologies to customers located throughout north america  europe  japan and the rest of asia 
these products range from low cost systems for high volume manufacturing to advanced systems for cost effective production of leading edge devices and for research and development applications 
additionally  the company manufactures and markets the ultrabeam v model electron beam pattern generation system based on vector scan technology for use in the development and production of photomasks for the integrated circuits ic industry 
the company has determined that two recent events have transpired which may result in a change in its electron beam technology efforts 
the first event is the announced intention of a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer to acquire the market share leader in electron beam technology 
the second event is the company s decision to ensure that its research and development spending is in line with the current stage of the industry s economic cycle and the company s stated desire to increase stockholder value 
as a result of these two events  the company is evaluating its level of spending in electron beam technology and may decide to either continue its efforts in electron beam technology  seek a partner for sharing future development funding in electron beam technology  sell its electron beam technology unit  or otherwise cease operations of its electron beam technology unit 
in such a scenario  significant uncertainties exist and circumstances currently unknown may result in the need to recognize an impairment of the company s electron beam technology assets in future financial periods  although management believes it will be able to realize its net investment in the technology and related net assets 
should an impairment occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted 
the company did not recognize any revenue related to its electron beam technology during and on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc isi  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems the acquisition for approximately million in cash  million in transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities 
results of operations the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
such variability depends upon a variety of factors  including substantial cyclicality in the company s target markets  various competitive factors including price based competition and competition from vendors employing other technologies  the timing and terms of significant orders  lengthy sales cycles for the company s products  the mix of products sold  inventory and open purchase commitment reserve positions  concentration of credit risk  lengthy development cycles for new products  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s products  delayed shipments to customers due to customer configuration changes and other factors  acquisition activities requiring the devotion of substantial management resources  lengthy manufacturing cycles for the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the startup of new product introductions  customer concentration  ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  patterns of capital spending by customers  product discounts  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors or suppliers  political and economic instability throughout the world  in particular the asia pacific region  natural disasters  regulatory changes  and business interruptions related to the company s occupation of its facilities 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including product discounts and increased competition in the company s targeted markets  the mix of products sold  inventory and open purchase commitment reserve provisions  the rate of capacity utilization  nonlinearity of shipments during the quarter  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from  to million for the company s x steppers  and million to more than million for the company s reduction steppers 
additionally  the company s ultrabeam electron beam lithography system is anticipated to sell in a range of million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing of recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve the company s objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  delay  deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  the company s net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same period in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment during the particular period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the company s net sales has historically been realized near the end of each quarter 
accordingly  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to reschedulings  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  has caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which has and could continue to materially adversely affect the company s operating results for such period 
in particular  the long manufacturing cycles of the company s titan wafer stepper registered trademark and saturn wafer stepper registered trademark  and the company s reduction stepper product offerings acquired through the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of isi in  and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the company has very limited experience in the manufacture of its ultrabeam electron beam pattern generation systems 
the ultrabeam systems are extremely complex and the product has significantly long manufacturing and sales cycles  which greatly increase the likelihood of delays in shipments from one quarter to the next 
due to the high list price for these systems  shipment delays would materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter if the shipment was delayed to the following quarter 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with certainty 
the company s business has in prior years been subject to seasonality  although the company believes such seasonality has been masked in recent years by cyclical trends within the semiconductor and thin film head industries 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its operating expenses in a particular period if the company fails to achieve its net sales goals for the period 
additionally  the company continues to operate at less than optimal capacity utilization  resulting in manufacturing inefficiencies that adversely affect the company s gross margins and results of operations 
the company presently anticipates that this trend will continue for at least the next few quarters 
the company presently expects that net sales for the three month period ending march  will be higher than net sales in the comparable period in however  due to lack of order visibility  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current sales levels 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab is effective for the company s first fiscal quarter  ending on march  at the present time  the company believes that the issuance of sab will result in the company recognizing sales of its systems based on installation and customer acceptance  rather than its current practice of recognizing revenue upon shipment 
the company is unsure as to the impact of sab on reported net sales and results of operations for the quarter ending march  however  in accordance with the provisions of sab  the company presently anticipates that it will report a significant cumulative charge relative to a change in accounting principle at the beginning of the quarter ending march  this charge will appear as a non operating item in the company s statement of operations 
in effect  systems shipped but not yet installed and accepted by customers as of december  would be included in the company s backlog 
these systems would be recognized as sales in the quarter in which installation and acceptance by the customer occurs 
the company presently anticipates that a majority of the net sales for the quarter ending march  will result from installation and customer acceptance of systems shipped in preceding periods 
irrespective of the impact of sab  the company presently expects to recognize an operating and net loss for the quarter ending march  these losses may extend to future quarters due  in part  to the significant level of planned research  development and engineering spending  relative to anticipated sales  the current low rate of capacity utilization  and the current backlog and order levels for the company s products 
the company has determined that two recent events have transpired which may result in a change in its electron beam technology efforts 
the first event is the announced intention of a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer to acquire the market share leader in electron beam technology 
the second event is the company s decision to ensure that its research and development spending is in line with the current stage of the industry s economic cycle and the company s stated desire to increase stockholder value 
as a result of these two events  the company is evaluating its level of spending in electron beam technology and may decide to either continue its efforts in electron beam technology  seek a partner for sharing future development funding in electron beam technology  sell its electron beam technology unit  or otherwise cease operations of its electron beam technology unit 
in such a scenario  significant uncertainties exist and circumstances currently unknown may result in the need to recognize an impairment of the company s electron beam technology assets in future financial periods  although management believes it will be able to realize its net investment in the technology and related net assets 
should an impairment occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted 
the company did not recognize any revenue related to its electron beam technology during and certain of the statements contained in this report may be considered forward looking statements that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed herein  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following highly competitive industry  difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  international sales  development of new product lines  rapid technological change  importance of timely product introductions  year compliance  future acquisitions  expansion of the company s product lines  dependence on key personnel  sole or limited sources of supply  intellectual property matters  environmental regulations  effects of certain anti takeover provisions  volatility of stock price  and the other risk factors listed from time to time in the company s sec reports 
due to these and additional factors  certain statements  historical results and percentage relationships discussed below will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
net sales vs 
net sales consist of revenue from system sales  spare parts sales  and service 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of as compared with net sales of million for the increase  relative to  was primarily attributed to improved conditions within the semiconductor industry  which has resulted in higher capital spending levels  partially offset by lower front end equipment sales to the thin film head industry 
for the year ended december   the company s unit system shipments increased  relative to  while the weighted average selling price of all systems sold declined slightly 
service revenue increased for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the product lines and related service business of isi in june of net sales of spare parts and product upgrades declined for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   international net sales were million  as compared with million for  an increase of 
international net sales represented of total net sales for the year ended december   as compared with for this year over year increase  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributed to sales to back end thin film head manufacturers in asia  excluding japan 
however  the company continues to be cautious in its outlook for the asian markets 
the company believes that the severe currency and equity market fluctuations that have been experienced in recent years by many of the asian markets has resulted in the past  and may continue to result  in delays  deferrals and cancellations of orders of the company s products  particularly in the short term  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are typically denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts  however  there can be no assurance of the success of any such efforts 
international sales expose the company to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which  in turn  impact the relative cost of ownership of the company s products and may place the company at a competitive disadvantage 
see additional risk factors international sales  japanese market 
during and  the company experienced a significant level of shipment delays and purchase order restructuring by several of its customers  and also experienced purchase order cancellations 
there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue in the future 
accordingly  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior level of sales 
additionally  the tfh market is currently in an over capacity situation 
this factor had a material adverse impact on net sales for the quarter ended december  and may further adversely impact net sales for at least the next several quarters 
the company presently expects that net sales for the three month period ending march  will be higher than net sales in the comparable period in however  due to lack of order visibility  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current sales levels 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab is effective for the company s first fiscal quarter  ending on march  at the present time  the company believes that the issuance of sab will result in the company recognizing sales of its systems based on installation and customer acceptance  rather than its current practice of recognizing revenue upon shipment 
the company is unsure as to the impact of sab on reported net sales and results of operations for the quarter ending march  however  in accordance with the provisions of sab  the company presently anticipates that it will report a significant cumulative charge relative to a change in accounting principle at the beginning of the quarter ending march  this charge will appear as a non operating item in the company s statement of operations 
in effect  systems shipped but not yet installed and accepted by customers as of december  would be included in the company s backlog 
these systems would be recognized as sales in the quarter in which installation and acceptance by the customer occurs 
the company presently anticipates that a majority of the net sales for the quarter ending march  will result from installation and customer acceptance of systems shipped in preceding periods 
because the company s net sales are subject to a number of risks  including intense competition in the capital equipment industry and the timing and market acceptance of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company will exceed or maintain its current level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  the company believes that the market acceptance and volume production of its xls advanced reduction stepper acquired from isi  and its titan  saturn and series families of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to its future financial results 
to the extent that these products do not achieve significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for such products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor industry  or any other reason  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  a decrease of as compared with net sales of million for the decline  relative to  was primarily attributed to the extremely weak market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the related markets for semiconductor capital equipment 
within this market segment  the company experienced significantly lower unit system shipments across all product lines 
additionally  the company experienced lower system shipments for front end thin film head processing  micromachining applications and the production of photomasks 
for the year ended december   the company s unit system shipments decreased  relative to  while the weighted average selling price of all systems sold declined slightly 
net sales from spare parts and product upgrades increased for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the product lines and related service business of isi 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  as compared with million for  a decline of 
international net sales represented of total net sales for the year ended december   as compared with for this year over year decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributed to decreased system sales to the asian market 
gross profit loss vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with a gross loss as a percentage of net sales of for in  the company recognized million in special charges related primarily to the write down of inventories and provisions for estimated losses associated with open purchase commitments 
these charges were primarily a result of the company s lower sales and bookings levels in  revised sales demand forecasts for and delays in the production readiness of the company s electron beam lithography system 
in addition to the special charges recognized in  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in can be further attributed to significantly higher capacity utilization  favorable changes in product mix  and a lower percentage of service revenue relative to total net sales  which typically has lower standard margins than system sales  partially offset by lower weighted average selling prices 
the company believes that gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of may be comparable to levels achieved during the three month period ended march  intense competition in the markets the company serves may make it difficult for the company to increase or maintain its current gross margin percentages in the near term 
vs 
the company s gross loss as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared with positive gross margin of for in  the company recognized million in special charges related primarily to the write down of inventories and provisions for estimated losses associated with open purchase commitments 
these charges were primarily a result of the company s lower sales and bookings levels in  revised sales demand forecasts for and delays in the production readiness of the company s electron beam lithography system 
in addition to the special charges recognized in  the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales can be further attributed to significantly lower capacity utilization  lower product margins as a result of higher production costs  unfavorable changes in product mix  a higher percentage of service and spare parts sales relative to total net sales  which typically have lower standard margins than system sales  and continued manufacturing inefficiencies as a result of non linearity of system shipments and customer cancellations  deferrals and reschedulings 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses were million for  as compared with million for the company continued to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its ultrabeam electron beam lithography system and its verdant rapid thermal annealing laser doping systems and technologies  together with continued expenditures for its x and reduction optical products and technologies 
the company presently expects that the absolute dollar amount of research  development and engineering expenses for the quarter ending march  will be significantly higher  relative to the comparable period in  due primarily to increased spending on its x and reduction optical products and technologies 
vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses  net of third party funding for certain projects  were million for  as compared with million for despite lower net sales  the company invested significant resources in the development and enhancement of its ultrabeam electron beam lithography system and in the development of its verdant rapid thermal annealing laser doping systems and technologies  together with continued expenditures for its x optical products and technologies 
additionally  in the company commenced research  development and engineering spending in the area of reduction lithography  as a direct result of the acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  as compared with million recorded for as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in  primarily as a result of higher net sales and cost containment measures implemented in the second half of the company presently anticipates that the absolute dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly during the quarter ending march   relative to the comparable period in  primarily as a result of higher anticipated net sales 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  as compared with million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in in  higher general and administrative expenses related to the operations acquired in the acquisition and higher general and administrative expenses for the company s verdant and ultrabeam operations were offset by cost containment measures implemented during the second half of the year 
additionally  lower expenses as are typically associated with a reduction in sales 
acquired in process research and development on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems 
as a result  the company recognized a charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d expense of million  or per share net of tax benefits  representing products in development stage that were not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company s management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated  by both interviews and data analysis  to determine its state of development and related fair value 
the company s review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to the company in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology was comprised of the total present value of the anticipated net cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the ipr d associated with the isi acquisition related to the development of optical and post optical lithography systems 
included were five projects i the xls isis and project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  ii the unity project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  iii the xls nm mid field and nm small field platforms  which were complete as of the acquisition date  iv the scalpel engineering feasibility project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  and v the euv stage project  which was complete as of the acquisition date 
the aforementioned completion percentages were based on an estimated weighted average of the time  cost  and complexity required to bring the projects to fruition 
the significant technological hurdles remaining to be addressed included the development of high resolution optical systems with ffuaxis illumination  the integration of complex sub 
systems into production worthy tools with user friendly operator interfaces  while achieving more precise overlay  the ability to design vacuum and inert gas containment systems without unacceptable reductions in throughput  the development of caf optical elements in sizes that have never been built  and the development of an autofocus system that is four times more accurate than any system ever developed 
the company estimated that as of the acquisition date  the remaining research and development work on these projects would cost approximately million and would be completed over the next one to five years 
these projects had progressed more slowly than originally projected due to lower than anticipated staffing 
the lower staffing levels were a result of the company s actions to reduce expenses during a period of reduced revenues and earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development and successful marketing of any products resulting from the completion of these projects 
a failure to successfully develop and market such products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of lepton inc  a developer of electron beam lithography systems 
as a result of this acquisition  the company recognized a charge for technology acquired for a research and development project of million  or per share  net of related income tax benefits 
special charges due primarily to the continued downturn in the thin film head and semiconductor industries  the company realized significantly lower sales and bookings levels during as a result  the company significantly reduced its production demand forecast for and implemented various cost containment measures beginning in the third quarter of during the third and fourth quarters of  the company recognized special charges in the amount of million and million  respectively  for the write down of excess inventories and provisions for estimated losses on open purchase commitments 
these charges were included in cost of sales 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company recognized charges in the amount of million and million  respectively  related to collection uncertainty of certain accounts and leases receivable and provisions for sales returns and allowances 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the company recognized charges of million as a result of the reduction in the company s workforce and the consolidation of certain of its facilities 
these charges have been included in operating expenses for in december  the company terminated its relationship with its japan distributor  innotech corporation 
this resulted in a special charge of million  or per share  in the quarter ended december   net of related income tax benefits  primarily related to termination fees negotiated between the company and innotech 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  which consists primarily of interest income  was million for as compared with million for and million for income taxes benefit the company did not recognize an income tax benefit on its pre tax loss for  due to uncertainty related to the utilization of its net operating loss carry forward 
income taxes benefit represented and of income loss before income taxes for and  respectively 
the decline in the tax rate for  relative to  is primarily a result of not recognizing a benefit for the net operating loss carry forward and certain deferred tax asset reserves recognized during the year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with million provided by operating activities during positive cash flows from operating activities during were primarily attributed to non cash charges to income of million  a reduction in inventories of million  an increase in income taxes payable of million  an increase in advance billings of million and a reduction of prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  partially offset by the net loss of million for the year ended december   an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decline in accrued expenses of million and an increase in other assets of million 
the increase in accounts receivable  as compared with december   was primarily attributed to a combination of higher sales levels and lower levels of accounts receivable sales to third parties  partially offset by improved collections 
the company sells certain of its accounts receivable in order to mitigate its credit risk and to enhance cash flow 
sales of accounts receivable typically precede final customer acceptance of the system 
among other terms and conditions  the agreements include provisions that require the company to repurchase receivables if certain conditions are present including  but not limited to  disputes with the customer regarding suitability of the product 
from time to time the company has repurchased certain accounts and leases receivable in accordance with these terms 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were outstanding to third party financial institutions 
the company may continue to attempt to mitigate the impact of extended payment terms and non linear shipments by selling a substantial portion of its accounts receivable in the future 
there can be no assurance that this financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of its systems  particularly newer products  the company s inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
additionally  as of december   the company had approximately million of net inventories and million of net long lived assets related to several new product lines  including its electron beam lithography technologies 
as such  these assets may be subject to a greater risk of impairment  which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company has determined that two recent events have transpired which may result in a change in its electron beam technology efforts 
the first event is the announced intention of a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer to acquire the market share leader in electron beam technology 
the second event is the company s decision to ensure that its research and development spending is in line with the current stage of the industry s economic cycle and the company s stated desire to increase stockholder value 
as a result of these two events  the company is evaluating its level of spending in electron beam technology and may decide to either continue its efforts in electron beam technology  seek a partner for sharing future development funding in electron beam technology  sell its electron beam technology unit  or otherwise cease operations of its electron beam technology unit 
in such a scenario  significant uncertainties exist and circumstances currently unknown may result in the need to recognize an impairment of the company s electron beam technology assets in future financial periods  although management believes it will be able to realize its net investment in the technology and related net assets 
should an impairment occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted 
the company did not recognize any revenue related to its electron beam technology during and during the year ended december   the company used million of net cash in its investing activities  primarily as a result of the net investment of million in available for sale securities  capital expenditures of million  and million for the purchase of licensed technology 
for the year ended december   there was  net cash provided by financing activities  as million generated from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan was partially offset by million used in repayment of a note payable 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company s principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  the company must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  investments in systems  procedures and controls and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
the company expects that anticipated cash flows from operations and its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital or capital equipment needs 
additionally  the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect any company profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event the company acquires product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement the company s business  or which otherwise do not enhance the company s sales or operating results  the company may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on the company s business or operating results 
additionally  the company may experience renewed interest in its equipment leasing program and this may result in the further formation of significant long term receivables  which  in turn  would require the use of substantial amounts of working capital 
the formation of significant long term receivables and the granting of extended customer payment terms exposes the company to additional risks  including potentially higher customer concentration and higher potential operating expenses relating to customer defaults 
during the three month periods ended september  and december   the company took significant reserves against certain leases receivable  which are currently non performing 
if additional reserves on lease receivables were required in the future  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent that the company s financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
year disclosure the information provided below constitutes a year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
march update through the first two months of the year  the company s operations around the world are fully functioning and have not experienced any significant issues associated with the year problem 
our customer support operations continue to communicate to us that the company s customers have not reported any consequential year incidents 
at the company s sites worldwide  we have not experienced any significant year related issue that would affect our ability to manufacture  ship  sell or service our products 
while we are encouraged by the success of our year efforts and that of our customers and suppliers  the company will continue to offer year support to customers and monitor our own operations 
the company presently estimates that the total cost for the entire yk project approximated one million dollars and that there are no significant project costs remaining 
however  additional requirements may be identified in the future and unscheduled costs may be incurred 
accordingly  despite favorable results so far  there can be no assurance that the company  or its vendors  will be able to timely and cost effectively update its products to avoid yk date errors  and this may result in material costs to the company  including costs associated with detecting and fixing such errors and costs incurred in litigation due to any such errors 
year readiness overview many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit entries in the attached date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields needed to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies needed to be upgraded to comply with such year yk requirements 
the company has provided an assessment  below  of the state of readiness of its information and non information technology systems  together with a summary of the status of related testing  remediation and implementation 
the company estimates that the total cost for the entire yk project approximated million and that the remaining project cost is insignificant 
however additional requirements may be identified and unscheduled costs may be incurred as the project proceeds 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company  or its vendors  will be able to timely and cost effectively update its products to avoid yk date errors  and this may result in material costs to the company  including costs associated with detecting and fixing such errors and costs incurred in litigation due to any such errors 
many commentators had predicted that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues and the company is aware of several such suits that are currently pending 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation and the highly technical nature of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by claims related to yk compliance 
although the company presently believes that it has made required changes to the software in its products  it believes that the most likely worst case scenario is from unknown impacts to its customers manufacturing processes  which could potentially adversely impact product yields and throughput 
in addition to possible litigation  the company could incur substantially higher product returns and warranty related expenses  either of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company s customers may be required to devote substantial financial resources to their own internal yk audit and compliance 
this may result in fewer financial resources available to purchase the company s products  fewer system sales by the company  and could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its own yk efforts have resulted  and may continue to result in  a diversion of management and financial resources  which has further resulted in the delay or deferral of various information technology and engineering projects 
information technology systems the company established  for all of its information systems  a yk conversion project to address necessary code changes  testing  and implementation and contingency plans 
the company has completed testing and verification of its primary business information system and has identified the significant potential risks associated with yk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  the company maintains a strict investment policy  which is designed to ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted long term investments 
these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading

beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest for financial reporting purposes at december  ending fair values comprise the estimated market principal plus accrued interest at a twelve month time horizon  and assumes no change in the investment principal or portfolio mix

the company mitigates default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
to date  the company has not experienced liquidity problems with its portfolio 
the company has not materially altered its investment objectives or criteria and believes that  although the composition of the company s portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally due to the limited scope of those operations and because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  the company has commenced direct sales operations and orders are typically denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
the realized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and offset against realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of the related yen denominated receivables 
at december  there were approximately million outstanding foreign currency forward contracts
