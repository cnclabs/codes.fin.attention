item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except average sales prices  per share data and ratio amounts the company is the largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in the world 
as of december   the company operated  funeral service locations  cemeteries  crematoria and two insurance operations located in countries on five continents 
the company conducts funeral service operations in all of the countries mentioned above  cemetery operations in north america  south america  australia and certain countries within europe  and financial services operations in north america and france 
as of december   the company s largest markets were north america and france  which when combined represent approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  of the company s consolidated income from operations and of the company s total operating locations 
the majority of the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that lower their individual overhead costs by sharing common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical and accounting staff  limousines  hearses and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest operating expense for the company  are the cost components most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allows the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities due to the traditional fluctuation in the number of funeral services and cemetery interments performed in a given period 
historically  the company s growth has been largely attributable to acquiring funeral service locations and cemeteries 
this resulted in the company creating the world s largest network of funeral service locations and cemeteries 
the company believes this network forms the foundation of its business plan going forward 
during the mid s  the market to acquire funeral service locations and cemeteries became more competitive than ever before and resulted in increasing prices which lowered returns on invested capital 
as a result  the company suspended its acquisition program in and is in transition from an acquisition company to an operating company 
this transition focuses on reducing overhead  streamlining operational functions and processes  increasing cash flow  providing better returns on the company s invested capital and reducing the company s debt 
the transition to an operating company will continue in the company s primary goals in are as follows continue to reduce overhead and streamline management structures 
improve business processes and information systems 
increase cash flow by continuing certain initiatives such as the reduction of capital expenditures compared to historical levels  the elimination of the company s quarterly dividend  the suspension of the acquisition program  the realignment of preneed cemetery and prearranged funeral sales structures and other working capital initiatives 
continue the development of third party consumer financing programs 
continue the sale of certain assets and non core businesses that are i not meeting the company s return on invested capital criteria and ii can provide a better return to the company from sales proceeds rather than from future projected operating cash flows 
continue the reduction of the company s debt levels to create a sound capital structure for the company and to reduce cash paid for interest costs 
continue the implementation of the company s long term strategic revenue and marketing initiatives intended to provide internal revenue growth without the outlay of significant additional capital 
such initiatives include implementation of dignity tm memorial plan funeral packages and the associated branding of many of the company s or affiliated locations  continued development of global affinity relationships and continued growth in the sale of prearranged funeral contracts in all jurisdictions 
continue to improve customer satisfaction throughout the company s global network while monitoring such customer satisfaction through new client family surveys tied to certain employees compensation 
the company believes the execution of the above initiatives will allow the company to maintain its position as the industry leader  as well as to provide long term value to our shareholders 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and for purposes of discussions between the years and  funeral homes  cemeteries and crematoria owned and operated before january   are referred to as comparable operations  and for discussions between the years and  funeral homes  cemeteries and crematoria owned and operated before january  are referred to as comparable operations 
correspondingly  for discussions between the years and  operations acquired or opened after january   are referred to as acquired operations and for discussions with respect to the years and  operations acquired or opened after january   are referred to as acquired operations 
the following table represents revenues and gross profit for the three years ended december  revenues funeral    cemetery    financial services    gross profit and margin percentage funeral    cemetery    financial services   the company s results of operations for from a gross profit margin and percentage standpoint were below and levels 
the primary reason for this was the difficult transition in to an operating company focused on cash flow and returns on invested capital from a company previously focused in and on growth through acquisitions 
more specifically  the results of operations in were negatively affected by i the reduction of net cemetery trust earnings  ii a reduction in gains on sales of businesses  iii a reduction of operating earnings related to the sale of excess undeveloped cemetery property  iv the downward pressure on operating margins related to the january acquisition of eci which historically had lower volume operations  v a delay in the realization of expected cost savings from cost rationalization programs primarily related to finalization of labor negotiations in the company s funeral operations in france  vi inefficiencies in the standardization of the company s cemetery sales cost structure  vii the focus on preneed sales of heritage cemetery property which generate higher commission and have higher property costs and viii loan loss provisions related to certain loans held by the company s lending subsidiary 
in  the company realigned its management of geographic segments to focus on total european operations 
although total amounts reported have not changed  the company has made certain reclassifications in all years in order to reflect the results of these geographic segments 
funeral funeral revenues for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage percentage increase increase decrease north america    european    other foreign    total funeral revenues    the  increase in funeral revenues from north american operations was primarily the result of the eci acquisition with revenues from comparable operations remaining relatively flat compared to the  increase in revenue over was primarily the result of a  increase in revenues from acquired locations offset by a  decrease from comparable locations 
the number of funeral services performed in comparable locations in north america increased over while the number of funeral services performed in comparable locations in north america decreased from the increase in volume for comparable locations in north america were slightly offset in by a decrease in average sales prices while the comparable locations in north america also experienced a decrease in average sales price of compared to the comparable average sales prices in north america for the years ended  and  respectively  were   and  the average sales price decreases have occurred because of continuing changes in the company s sales mix resulting from a higher proportion of funerals from prearranged contracts being serviced and an increase in the number of cremations performed  which typically carry lower sales price averages than traditional atneed funeral services 
the sales average related to prearranged funeral contracts turning atneed has historically been lower than the current atneed sales average primarily due to the servicing of prearranged contracts inherited by the company through acquisitions 
north america acquired locations performed  funeral services in and  in  while acquired locations in north america performed  funeral services in and  in government data indicates the number of deaths in the united states has increased over the last three years 
the center for disease control and prevention cdc tracks deaths in cities in across the united states and in those cities total deaths have increased in from and in from the company has comparable locations in in of those cities and cdc statistics from these cities indicate the company increased market share in those cities during compared to revenues from the company s european operations increased  in compared to and  in compared to  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
these acquisitions were primarily in spain  norway and the netherlands in and france  spain  portugal  norway and the netherlands in revenues from comparable locations decreased in compared to due to decreases in the average sales price of approximately while volumes were relatively consistent with the prior year 
revenues from comparable locations in increased over revenues from other foreign operations increased  in as a result of acquisitions in chile and argentina and growth in comparable locations in the pacific rim of over while volume declined in the pacific rim by  the average sales price increased partially as a result of favorable exchange rate variances between the australian dollar and the us dollar 
revenues from other foreign operations decreased  in from primarily due to a decline in the australian dollar versus the us dollar  partially offset by increased revenues from argentinian acquisitions 
during the year ended december   the company sold  of prearranged funeral contracts compared to approximately  in and  in the obligations are funded through both trust and insurance backed contracts 
of those prearranged sales  approximately  in and  in will be funded by company insurance operations 
the revenues associated with these prearranged funeral services are deferred and will be reflected in funeral revenues in the periods that the funeral services are performed 
the company expects to continue the emphasis on selling prearranged funerals as a means of protecting current market share and sales mix  as well as to expand market share in certain markets 
funeral gross profit and margin percentage for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage percentage percentage of revenue of revenue of revenue north america    european    other foreign    total funeral gross profit    the decreases in gross margin percentage in north america in and were due to increased costs and expenses of and  respectively  while revenues increased and  respectively  as discussed above 
the increased costs and expenses were primarily due to higher costs at acquired locations  specifically related to the company s merger with eci in january typically  acquisitions will temporarily exhibit lower gross profit margins than those experienced by the company s comparable locations until these locations have been fully assimilated into the company s clusters 
further  the gross margin percentage at eci locations had been historically lower than the company s gross margin percentages and this has negatively affected the total gross margin percentage in north america 
comparable locations experienced a increase in operating expenses in compared to primarily related to increases in promotional and advertising expenses as part of the transition to an operating company from one previously focused on growth through acquisitions 
in such comparable costs were relatively flat as compared to the decrease in european gross profit and margin percentage in was primarily the result of less funeral services performed causing reduced profit due to the company s fixed cost structure  coupled with delays in labor negotiations in france related to cost rationalization programs 
the decrease in european gross profit and margin percentage in was primarily the result of a disproportionate increase in total costs and expenses of primarily related to acquisitions 
the decrease in other foreign gross margin percentage in was primarily due to increased costs and expenses in australia coupled with the addition of lower operating margin funeral businesses from the chilean acquisitions  partially offset by improved margins in argentina 
the decrease in other foreign gross profit and margin percentage in was primarily due to increased costs and expenses in australia and lower operating margins in argentinean acquisitions 
in  australian costs and expenses increased approximately more than the change in revenue 
cemetery cemetery revenues for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage percentage increase increase north america    european    other foreign    total cemetery revenues    the increase of  in north american cemetery revenues was primarily the result of the  increase in acquisitions as a result of the january merger with eci  partially offset by the decrease of net cemetery trust earnings of and a reduction of operating earnings related to the sale of excess undeveloped cemetery property 
comparable atneed and preneed revenue in remained stable compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue from north american cemetery operations of  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from acquisitions  increased trust earnings of and increased revenue from sales of excess undeveloped cemetery property compared to comparable preneed and atneed sales in were relatively flat as compared to the increases in revenue from european operations were the result of acquisitions in the united kingdom and belgium in and in the united kingdom and the netherlands in the  increase in revenues from other foreign operations was the result of acquisitions in chile  argentina and uruguay and a increase in revenue in australian operations 
the  increase in revenues was the result of the inclusion of new argentina operations for the full year offset by a decline in australia cemetery revenue 
cemetery gross profit and margin percentage for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage percentage percentage of revenue of revenue of revenue north america    european    other foreign    total cemetery gross profit    north america cemetery gross profit declined  primarily due to increased costs of at comparable locations 
these increased costs were primarily the result of increases in property costs and commission expenses related to the sale of heritage cemetery property sales initiatives 
the decrease in the north america cemetery gross profit margin percentage in was primarily the result of these increased costs coupled with the reductions in net cemetery trust earnings and operating earnings related to the sale of excess undeveloped cemetery property 
the north america cemetery gross profit increased  primarily due to the corresponding growth in revenue discussed above 
costs of services at comparable locations remained flat in from and  while costs from acquired locations increased  these increases were offset by increases in net cemetery trust earnings and operating earnings related to sales of excess undeveloped cemetery property 
the increase of  in european gross profit was the result of increases due to acquisitions in belgium and the united kingdom 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was the result of increased costs in anticipation of growth associated with comparable locations in the united kingdom 
the increase of  in other foreign gross profit and the corresponding increase in the margin percentage was the result of increases in the gross profit and margin percentage from the company s acquired south american operations 
the margin percentage in argentina has improved to in from in the decline in other foreign margin percentage in was due to the inclusion of a full year of cemetery operations in argentina during which reduced gross margin percentage when combined with the higher margin australian operations 
argentina has significantly lower gross margin percentages than chile or australia  however  these margin percentages are in line with the company s expectations 
financial services financial services represents a combination of the company s insurance operations and a lending subsidiary 
financial services revenues for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage increase percentage decrease increase insurance north america   france    total insurance    lending subsidiary    total financial services revenues    the increase in insurance revenues in and was due to the north american acquisition of aml effective july further  a portion of the increase in revenue in is related to the company s initiatives to fund a higher percentage of prearranged funeral contracts through aml as opposed to third party insurance or trust funded contracts 
insurance revenues from the company s french operations decreased due to decreased investment income related to a repositioning of the investment portfolio 
although the average outstanding loan portfolio associated with the lending subsidiary increased in from  revenues remained relatively flat between the two years due to the non performing status of certain loans subsequent to september  growth from the lending subsidiary in is attributable to the increasing loan portfolio 
the average outstanding loan portfolio was  in   in and  in financial services gross profit and margin percentage for the three years ended december   were as follows percentage percentage percentage of revenue of revenue of revenue insurance north america   france    total insurance    lending subsidiary    total financial services gross profit loss   the decrease in the north american insurance gross margin percentage was the result of increased production 
while revenue and gross profit have both increased during this period of growth  benefits and expenses have also increased  thereby reducing the gross margin percentage 
although french insurance revenues in were negatively affected by decreased investment income related to the repositioning of their investment portfolio  gross profit was negatively impacted only slightly due to a corresponding reduction in expense and the margin percentages were positively affected due to the lower revenue used to calculate the margin percentage 
the company s lending subsidiary reported a gross loss of  for the year ended december   compared to gross profit of  and  for the same periods in and  respectively 
as part of its cost rationalization programs initiated in  the company decided to indefinitely suspend the operations of the lending subsidiary by selling a portion of the loan portfolio and acquiring by deed in lieu of foreclosure the collateral underlying other certain loans in its portfolio 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  in the fourth quarter of associated with the lending subsidiary s loans that are not being held for sale 
see note eighteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of these nonrecurring charges related to the company s lending subsidiary 
the lending subsidiary s gross profit was affected in by a decrease in the average interest rate spread for the year  primarily as a result of the non performing status of certain loans discussed above 
for the three years ended december   the average interest rate spread was  and  respectively 
other income and expenses the company s general and administrative expenses increased in to  compared to  in and  in expressed as a percentage of revenues  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to and levels is primarily related to non recurring cost items such as information technology costs related to the company s year preparation and professional costs associated with process improvement initiatives and implementation of eva r based incentive compensation models 
interest expense increased  or in compared to and increased  or in compared to this increased interest expense was primarily reflective of increased indebtedness assumed due to acquisitions  specifically as it relates to the eci merger in january the average borrowings during were  compared to  in and  in the average interest rates for each of these years were  and for  and  respectively 
the company expects interest expense to increase to approximately  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the company s lower credit rating 
other income primarily consists of gains and losses from the sales of businesses that are disposed of for strategic or government mandated purposes 
in  other income was  compared to  in and  in the fluctuation between  of other income in and  of other income in reflects the gain on the sale in of the company s equity interest in eci of  the provision benefit for income taxes reflects a effective tax rate for  compared to a effective tax rate in and a effective tax rate in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the nondeductible losses recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the company s restructuring charges 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a larger relative profit contribution from international operations which are taxed at lower rates 
included in the provisions for all years were tax benefits relating to enacted tax rate changes in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
financial condition and liquidity general historically  the company has funded its working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank revolving credit agreements and commercial paper 
funding required for the company s acquisition program historically has been generated through public and private offerings of debt and the issuance of equity securities supplemented by the company s revolving credit agreements 
during  the company s liquidity needs and capital funding requirements changed as the company transitioned away from an acquisition company to an operating company focused on increasing cash flow  reducing overhead costs and paying down debt 
the company developed a series of cash flow initiatives in related to ongoing operations of the company  the sale of certain assets and non core businesses and sources of cash flow from providing third party financing to consumers 
these cash flow initiatives were developed in late and will not effect the company s cash flow until and beyond 
cash flow initiatives related to the ongoing operations of the company include i the suspension of the acquisition program  ii the reduction of capital expenditures compared to historical levels  iii the suspension of the quarterly cash dividend  iv the obtaining of funds available from certain of the company s trusts more efficiently  and v the realignment of preneed cemetery and prearranged funeral sales structures to become more cash flow positive 
the company believes the above cash flow initiatives  coupled with other working capital initiatives  will produce operating free cash flow on an after tax basis in the range of  to  in the company defines operating free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles  less capital expenditures  dividends paid  the net effect of prearranged funeral production and maturities 
the operating free cash flow projections above do not include approximately  of projected net cash outflow in associated with the company s first and fourth quarter restructuring and nonrecurring charges 
the company developed cash flow initiatives in to sell certain assets and non core businesses that are either not meeting the company s criteria for returns on invested capital or are more valuable to parties outside the company 
the company expects after tax proceeds of  to  from these sales of non core financial or operational assets in in  the above cash flow initiatives developed in are expected to produce approximately  to  of funds available for reducing debt on an after tax basis 
this projection again does not include approximately  of net cash outflows in associated with the company s restructuring charges 
these funds available for debt reduction also do not include any possible effect on cash flows associated with the development of a consumer financing program in north america for the company s atneed funeral and cemetery and preneed cemetery client families  which could improve or generate cash flow for the company and enhance the company s ability to further pay down debt 
the company had total debt of  at december  versus  at december  the largest component of this debt relates to the company s primary revolving credit agreements 
the company s primary revolving credit agreements provide for borrowings up to  and consists of two day facilities and a five year  multi currency facility due in one of the day facilities permits borrowings up to  and the outstanding balance at maturity june  may be converted into a two year term loan at the company s option 
the second day facility permits borrowings up to  and expires november  as of december   approximately  was available under these three facilities 
these facilities have financial compliance provisions that contain certain restrictions  including a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of  a minimum interest coverage of  a minimum net worth requirement defined in the facility agreements  and limitations on cash disbursements  subsidiary borrowings  liens and guarantees 
see note eight to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information on the company s primary revolving credit facilities 
historically  the company has classified borrowings under these facilities as long term debt since it has been the company s intent to refinance such borrowings with long term debt or equity 
in  however  the company s downgraded credit ratings  both short term and long term  have limited its access to the capital markets 
as such  borrowings primarily commercial paper of approximately  backed by the  facility have been classified as current maturities of long term debt 
as of december   the company had a total of  of current maturities of long term debt 
as mentioned above  the company believes it will generate funds available for reducing debt on an after tax basis of  to  not including the projected net cash outflow of  related to the company s restructuring charges 
based on these funds available  coupled with banking relationships that the company would characterize as positive  the company believes it will meet all of its financial obligations and requirements in sources and uses of cash cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an improvement of  significant components of cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  include net loss of  adjusted for normal non cash items such as  of depreciation and amortization  restructuring and nonrecurring charge provisions of  reduced by cash paid of  related to the charges  an increase in receivables of  primarily related to the sales of preneed cemetery products and services which are usually financed on an installment basis in excess of twelve months and an increase in other liabilities of  primarily related to the non cash add back associated with the actuarially determined liability recorded by the company s insurance operations 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an improvement of  significant components of cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   include capital expenditures of   of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment   of cash used in acquisitions and  of purchases in excess of sales of securities associated with the company s insurance operations 
one of the insurance operations had an approximate  cash position at december   of which a significant portion of the cash was used to purchase securities during the remaining amount of cash used to purchase securities in excess of the sales of securities represents the investment of net cash generated by insurance premiums received from customers after payment of cash expenses which is included within net cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the same period in the company issued approximately  of long term debt in  which is included in the  amount above 
significant components of cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   include increases in borrowings of  from the company s revolving credit facilities offset by  for the early extinguishment of certain floating rate debt and eci convertible debentures  payments of debt of  and payments of cash dividends of  at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  compared to working capital surplus of  as of december  the working capital deficit of  is primarily a result of the current liability of  at december  related to the company s restructuring charges as well as related to  of current maturities of long term debt  of which  relates to the company s revolving credit facilities 
as discussed earlier  certain balances outstanding on the company s revolving credit facilities cannot be classified as long term at december   due to the company s current lack of access to the capital markets 
as part of the company s ongoing cash flow initiatives  the company terminated or assigned certain interest rate swaps and all cross currency interest rate swaps subsequent to year end and received approximately  in net pretax proceeds 
these proceeds were primarily used to purchase certain of the company s bonds  of which approximately  of these bonds were due in the company had a current ratio at december   compared to a current ratio of at december  the company had a cash balance of  at december  compared to a cash balance of  at december  approximately  of the december  cash balance was contemplated to be used to repay eci s revolving credit facility and aml had an approximate  cash balance at december  which was used to purchase securities in as of december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was compared to at december  excluding the  of restructuring and nonrecurring charges  the interest coverage ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period of at december   the company had the ability to issue  in securities registered with the securities and exchange commission the commission under a shelf registration 
in addition   shares of common stock and a total of  of guaranteed promissory notes and convertible debentures are registered under a separate shelf registration to be used exclusively for acquisitions 
the company has suspended its acquisition program and does not anticipate these acquisition shelf registrations to be drawn upon in the near future 
prearranged funeral services the company sells prearranged funeral contracts in most of its service markets  including its major foreign markets 
the company has a marketing program to sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts and the funds collected are generally held in trust or are used to purchase life insurance or annuity contracts 
the amounts paid into trust funds or premiums paid on insurance contracts will be received in cash by a company funeral service location at the time the funeral is performed 
earnings on trust funds and increasing benefits under insurance and annuity funded contracts also increase the amount of cash to be received upon performance of the funeral service 
direct costs incurred with the sale of prearranged funeral contracts are a current use of cash which is partially offset with cash retained  pursuant to state laws  from amounts trusted and certain general agency commissions earned by the company for sales of insurance products 
the company has an investment program which entails the ongoing consolidation of multiple trustees  the use of institutional managers with differing investment styles and consolidated performance monitoring and tracking 
this program targets a real return in excess of the amount necessary to cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service as well as any selling costs 
this is accomplished by allocating the portfolio mix to investments that match the anticipated maturity of the contracts 
the company targets an asset allocation for prearranged funeral trusts of approximately equity  fixed income and alternative investments 
the company s north american prearranged funeral trust portfolio earned a return of  and in  and  respectively including realized and unrealized gains and net of investment expenses 
aml  which was acquired by the company in  has been a provider of insurance products used to fund company prearranged funerals in north america for several years 
during  the company began a strategic initiative to fund a higher percentage of its north american prearranged funeral sales through aml as opposed to third party insurance or trust funded contracts 
auxia primarily sells insurance and annuity products used to fund prearranged funerals to be performed by the company s french funeral service locations 
prearranged funeral sales afford the company the opportunity to protect both current market share and mix as well as expand market share in certain markets 
the company believes this will stimulate future revenue growth 
prearranged funeral services fulfilled as a percent of the total funerals performed at comparable north america funeral service locations approximates in and in this percentage is expected to grow  thereby making the number of funerals performed and related revenues  which will be recognized in future periods  more predictable 
the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts includes both trust funded and insurance funded contracts and represents the original contract value plus any accumulated trust earnings or increasing insurance benefits 
the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts consists of two components i contracts funded by trust or third party insurance companies and ii contracts funded by the company s insurance operations 
the value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts to be funded by trust or third party insurance companies are included in deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues in the consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of the value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts to be funded by the company s insurance operations is included as a component of reserves and annuity benefits insurance operations in the consolidated balance sheet and reflects only the actuarially determined amounts to be funded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for life insurance companies 
the remaining component of reserves and annuity benefits insurance operations represents the actuarially determined amounts to be funded for non sci unperformed prearranged funeral contracts 
as of december  and  the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts was as follows assuming the company s contracts only  at face value  plus accrued earnings or increasing death benefits deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues   contracts funded by the company s insurance operations   the following table summarizes the changes in the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts for the years ended december beginning balance   net sales   acquisitions dispositions   realized earnings and increasing insurance benefits   maturities   change in cancellation reserve   effect of foreign currency and other   ending balance   the increase in net sales was due to the company s revenue initiative to increase prearranged funeral sales 
acquisitions and dispositions has increased primarily due to the merger with eci in january the increase in the cancellation reserve is due to adjustments made to better reflect the company s historical experience 
the recognition of the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral revenues is estimated to occur in the subsequent years as follows through  and thereafter  cremations in recent years there has been a steady growth trend in the number of cremations in north america that have been chosen as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
outside of north america  the cremation rate is much more stable 
in  in of all families served by the company s comparable north america funeral service locations selected cremation  substantially more than the national average according to industry studies 
the company has a significant number of operating locations in florida and the west coast of north america where cremation rates have been historically higher than the national average 
though a cremation typically results in fewer sales dollars than a traditional funeral service  the company believes funeral service locations which are predominantly cremation businesses typically have higher gross profit margin percentages than those exhibited at traditional funeral service locations 
the company has expanded its product alternatives in high cremation markets in north america which has resulted in higher average sales 
the company continues to believe there are markets in select areas within north america where products and services related to the memorialization of cremated remains represent a source of revenue and margin growth 
cremation memorialization has long been a tradition in australia and the united kingdom 
based on industry studies  approximately of all dispositions in australia and the united kingdom were cremations 
it is estimated that approximately of all dispositions in france are cremations 
the company also operates the only nationally branded cremation society with the largest membership in north america called national cremation society ncs 
ncs currently operates in four high cremation states and has plans to expand into nine additional high cremation states and canadian provinces in ncs locations are predominately store front locations with little capital investment and have a prearranged backlog of approximately  contracts as of december  while the average sale of ncs contracts is approximately  to  gross profit margins are in the to range

the capitalized expenditures represent new hardware and new enterprise software that introduced new functionality to the company 
all of the estimated remaining  expenditures will be expensed over the course of the related lease term 
in an effort to report material costs related to the company s yk effort  the company has adopted a policy of capturing all costs of one thousand dollars or more  all contractor expenses  and internal costs for dedicated resources those working exclusively on yk issues 
as such  the company acknowledges that many internal resources worked part time on yk related issues for which no payroll or overhead costs are being reported

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes nine and ten to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company uses derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
the derivative instruments held by the company are for hedging purposes and are neither leveraged nor speculative in nature 
movements in interest rates that impact the fair value of the interest rate swaps generally offset corresponding movements in the value of the underlying debt being hedged 
likewise  movements in currency rates that impact swaps generally offset corresponding movements in the value of the underlying foreign assets being hedged 
in addition  currency movements that impact foreign interest expense due under the cross currency interest rate swaps generally offset corresponding movements in the earnings of the foreign operation 
at december   after giving consideration to the interest rate swaps  the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
at december   the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
the company s overall sensitivity to floating interest rates is diversified in that approximately of the company s floating rate exposure  as of december   is based in eight markets other than the united states at december  
in general  the company has hedged up to of its net investment in foreign assets when such investment is considered significant and when it is reasonably cost efficient to do so 
in addition  the company does not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
approximately of the company s net investment and of its income from operations are denominated in foreign currencies at december  due to the cross currency hedges described above  approximately of the company s net assets and approximately of the company s income from operations are subject to translation risk at december  in january  the company materially modified its participation in derivative transactions by terminating or assigning away certain interest rate swaps and all cross currency interest rate swaps as mentioned in note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  thereby removing the company s hedges of foreign exchange rate exposure and the diversification of floating rate exposure mentioned above 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with the company s insurance operations  prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and services sales  the company owns investments in equity securities and mutual funds which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and  are presented in notes four  five and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk the company s financial instruments that were subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate risk at december   include debt instruments  us dollar interest rate swaps  and cross currency interest rate swaps 
the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these risks on earnings 
this analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical impact 
the analysis conducted below excludes the assets of both the lending subsidiary and the company s insurance operations 
instead  these are referenced separately in tabular format below 
a sensitivity analysis of those instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumed an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  the company s pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would have been negatively impacted by approximately  on december   and  on december  had the company terminated certain interest rate swaps in december  as discussed in note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  this same sensitivity analysis indicates that the company s pretax annual earnings would have been negatively impacted by approximately  on december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on interest expense 
at december   the company s debt and derivative exposure was primarily associated with the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  chilean peso  swiss franc  and norwegian krone 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar would have negatively impacted the company s interest expense on an annual basis by approximately  on december   and  on december  had the company terminated the cross currency interest rate swaps in december  as discussed in note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  this same sensitivity analysis indicates that the company s annual interest expense would have been negatively impacted by approximately  on december  for certain assets associated with the company s lending subsidiary and insurance operations  the tables below present principal cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rates as of december  thereafter fair value lending subsidiary receivables        average rate insurance subsidiaries investments in debt securities        average rate as of december  thereafter fair value lending subsidiary receivables        average rate insurance subsidiaries investments in debt securities        average rate to reduce exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so the weighted average duration of the investments approximates the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the insurance companies are subject to reinvestment risk upon either sale or maturity of the debt securities 
management believes that absence of any material amounts of high yield or non investment grade investments in the portfolios of the company s insurance operations enhances the ability of the insurance companies to provide security to their policyholders
