the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and owned a interest as of december  as additional limited partners are admitted to the operating partnership in exchange for the contribution of properties  the company s percentage ownership in the operating partnership will decline

the company conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the operating partnership either directly or through subsidiaries such that an op unit is economically equivalent to a share of the company s common stock 
an upreit may allow the company to offer units in the operating partnership in exchange for ownership interests from tax motivated sellers 
under certain circumstances  the exchange of units for a seller s ownership interest will enable the operating partnership to acquire assets while allowing the seller to defer the tax liability associated with the sale of such assets 
effectively  this allows the company to use units instead of stock to acquire properties  which provides an advantage over non upreit entities

economic conditions inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years with certain segments of the economy experiencing disinflation  such as apparel sales 
disinflation in this market segment has slowed the growth of tenant sales  which adversely affects the company s revenue due to lower percentage and overage rents on some properties 
any weakness in the overall retail environment as it relates to tenant sales volumes may have an impact on the company s ability to renew leases at current rental rates or to re lease space to other tenants 
a decline in sales does not affect base rent  aside from renewals  however  sales declines could result in reduced revenue from percentage rent tenants  as well as overage rent paid to the company 
both revenue items are directly impacted by sales volumes and represented of the company s total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for december  continuation of this trend may affect the company s operating centers occupancy rate  rental rates  and concessions  if any  granted on new leases or re leases of space 
this in turn may cause fluctuations in the cash flow from the operation and performance of the operating centers
