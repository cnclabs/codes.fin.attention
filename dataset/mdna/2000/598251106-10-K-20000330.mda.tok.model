total loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in total loans was principally due to increased commercial  commercial real estate  and agricultural loans 
commercial loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase reflects increased demand due to a strong economy  and increased working capital and equipment requirements both by existing borrowers and new customer relationships 
commercial real estate loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in commercial real estate loans reflects the strong economy  continued growth in the commercial real estate market  increased commitments with existing borrowers and market penetration and market share growth of new banking centers

although the risk of nonpayment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan

risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a loan type such as commercial or residential and fluctuating land values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan 
consumer loans additionally face the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
while the company has a sizable portion of its loan portfolio secured by real estate in one form or another  a significant portion of those loans have fixed or adjustable or floating interest rates 
the company believes that most credits should have both a primary and a secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be supported by operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be disposition of collateral 
the company engages in very little unsecured lending  and generally requires personal guarantees of principals for business obligations 
the company practices a system of concurrence in the approval of commercial credit whereby the documented concurrence of an officer s credit committee or approval by the board or a board committee  where applicable is obtained in addition to that of the recommending officer 
this system is intended to assure that commercial credit is subjected to an independent objective review on at least two different levels

on a case by case basis  the company discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan once it becomes days past due 
all accrued and uncollected interest is charged against income at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the financial position of the borrower indicates that there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely payment of principal and interest

analysis of allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses has been established to provide for those loans that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for potential loan losses

the company maintains an internal loan review function  which reviews commercial and consumer credits with the individual loan officers and assigns a risk rating grade 
in the event loan review downgrades a loan  it is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance allocated to the loans is based upon regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences ie  collateral value is minimal  ie once the specific portion of the allowance is calculated  management then calculates a percentage of each loan category based upon the past five years of loan loss history 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is determined based upon current economic conditions  trends in the portfolio  including delinquencies and impairments  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses increased  or to million for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  and million at december  total recoveries on loans previously charged off were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  these recoveries were due primarily to payments from customers bankruptcy proceedings or payment plans on charged off loans  which were negotiated subsequently with customers

the securities portfolio consists primarily of agency guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented   and of total securities as of december    and  respectively 
based upon the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are a superior investment vehicle for the banks 
mortgage backed securities also offer the best combination of yield and liquidity within the company s planning periods 
mortgage backed securities offer attractive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
the banks investment strategy during the past two years have been focused on seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives years which have been purchased at discounts  at par  and at a premium to par 
historically  management believes these securities are reasonably predictable in terms of price volatility  prepayment speeds and monthly cash flows 
the sharp decrease in long term investment yields  and as a consequence lower mortgage rates  led to a significant increase in prepayment speeds in as a result  management repositioned the securities portfolio to reduce the overall impact on yields and improve longer term profitability 
the portfolio is still composed primarily of mortgage backed securities  but a significant portion of mortgage backed securities held in was replaced in and collateralized mortgage obligations have been a decreasing percentage of the total portfolio during the past three years 
collateralized mortgage backed securities were million or of the total portfolio as of december  collateralized mortgage obligations were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented and of the total securities portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
management s decision to reduce collateralized mortgage backed obligations was consistent with overall regulatory concerns regarding this type of investment for community banks 
all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment rates 
the company uses computer simulation models to test the average life and yield volatility of adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations under various interest rate assumptions to monitor volatility 
stress tests are performed quarterly

in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
in the third quarter of  the banks received approval for membership in the federal home loan bank fhlb  which provides an additional source of liquidity 
the banks have used the fhlb extensively during   and assuming collateral is available to secure loans  the banks can borrow up to of assets with the federal home loan bank which provided an additional million in unused capacity at december  the banks also have various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to million of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements and brokered certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was million at december  the banks maintain these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk and to enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the company monitors and manages its position on several bases  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring the majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly  and also by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio

net cash provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of earnings  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each bank s internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each bank s assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each bank and the effects of rate changes on each bank s earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the board of directors 
each bank also maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based upon simulation modeling  these guidelines include a change in net interest income upon an immediate or gradual basis point change in interest rates 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and asset liability management 
impact of new accounting standards beginning january   statement on financial accounting standards no 
the statement on derivatives will require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value in the balance sheet 
unless designated as hedges  changes in these fair values will be recorded in the income statement 
fair value changes involving hedges will generally be recorded by offsetting gains and losses on the hedge and on the hedged item  even if the fair value of the hedged item is not otherwise recorded 
since the company has no significant derivative instruments or hedging activities  adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements  but the effect will depend on derivative holdings when this standard applies 
year compliance the company tested its critical systems in connection with the year date change 
no significant problems were encountered during the testing phase 
the company also developed a contingency plan to address potential problems arising with the year date change 
the century date change has not affected any of the company s critical or noncritical systems 
the company did not experience any significant disruption in operations as a result of year while the company is not aware of any year issues affecting it at this time and none are expected  there can be no assurance that problems  not yet apparent to the company  its vendors  or its customers will not arise as the year progresses 
if potential problems were to arise  they could have a material adverse affect on the company and result in unexpected costs 
total expenditures on the year project through december  were approximately  which is consistent with the amount management estimated for the project 
expenditures were primarily related to repair or replacement of specific software and hardware  expenses associated with facilities  products and supplier reviews  customer disclosure  marketing expenses  and project management expenses 
the cost does not include internal salary and employee benefit costs for individuals that had responsibilities or were involved with the year project 
unless undetected problems arise  management does not anticipate any additional expenditures in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis and gap analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp  base  bp  bp   net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands bp  bp  base  bp  bp  as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would increase the company s net interest income by or approximately million 
overall net interest income sensitivity has increased slightly from to  but remains within company and recommended regulatory guidelines
