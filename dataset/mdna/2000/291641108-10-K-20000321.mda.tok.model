see note of notes to financial statements under item for further information 
the merger  which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the constituent companies  is expected to close after all of the conditions to the consummation of the merger are met or waived 
the merger is conditioned  among other things  upon approvals of federal regulatory agencies and approvals of state regulatory authorities in states where the combined company will operate 
at a special meeting of stockholders held on september   the merger was approved with of the company s outstanding shares voting in favor of the proposal 
utilicorp is not required to obtain its stockholders approval of the merger 
the company and utilicorp filed joint applications with the ferc on november  and the missouri commission on december  requesting approval of the merger 
applications to merge were filed with the arkansas public service commission on january  and with the kansas corporation commission and oklahoma corporation commission on january  the applications set forth a proposed regulatory plan the plan which would result in a five year rate moratorium following the conclusion of a rate case the company plans to file in the second half of this rate case is designed to recover the costs associated with the company s state line project anticipated to be operational by june the plan also calls for utilicorp to keep any savings generated by the merger to offset the acquisition premium 
utilicorp may file a rate case at the end of the five year rate moratorium allowing utilicorp to include one half of any unamortized acquisition premium in the rate base  thus allowing it to be recovered in rates 
the missouri commission has scheduled hearing dates for the merger proposal for september  in jefferson city  missouri  which means a ruling could be issued by that commission before the end of this year 
utilicorp is a multinational energy and energy services company headquartered in kansas city  missouri 
it has regulated utility operations in eight states and energy operations in new zealand  australia  the united kingdom and canada 
it also owns non utility subsidiaries involved in energy trading  natural gas gathering  processing and transportation  energy efficiency services and various other energy related businesses 
for more information on the merger  see the company s proxy statement for its special meeting of stockholders held on september   which is dated august  results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of the company s total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers and from wholesale off system transactions 
the remainder of such revenues were derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total on system kwh sales for the company s on system customers increased slightly during while revenues increased slightly more than the corresponding increase in kwh sales 
customer growth increased slightly in over the growth rate in despite above average temperatures in july and august  residential kwh sales decreased with revenues decreasing as compared to this decrease was primarily due to unusually mild temperatures during the second quarter of  as well as in september  november and december  and the unusually warm second and third quarters of commercial and industrial classes showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues due to continued increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory 
on system wholesale kwh sales were down slightly in  reflecting the mild temperatures discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales decreased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
this clause permits the pass through to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
kwh sales for the company s on system customers increased during primarily due to above average temperatures during the second and third quarters 
revenues increased more than the corresponding increase in kwh sales primarily due to increased rates in missouri and arkansas as reflected in the table below and the winter summer differential in rates 
this differential results from summer rates being higher than winter rates  so warm summer temperatures that increase summer kwh usage cause the corresponding annual revenues to increase at a greater rate than the annual kwhs 
revenues and kwh sales were also positively impacted by million  and million kwhs respectively  as a result of a change in the estimation of periodic loss factors used to calculate unbilled revenues 
customer growth increased slightly to in as compared to in residential and commercial kwh sales increased as compared to  primarily due to the above average temperatures discussed above 
industrial classes  although not particularly weather sensitive  also showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues due to continued increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory 
on system wholesale kwh sales were up significantly in  reflecting the warm summer temperatures and continued increases in business activity discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause 
the following table sets forth information regarding electric rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above percent date increase increase increase date jurisdiction requested requested granted granted effective arkansas   missouri   an increase of  was granted effective an additional  increase became effective in addition to sales to its own customers  the company sells power to other utilities as available and provides transmission service through its system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during revenues from such off system transactions were approximately million as compared to approximately million in and approximately million during the increase in revenues during was primarily the result of an increase in firm capacity charges as well as an increase in sales resulting from the ability to sell power at market based rates 
pursuant to orders issued by the ferc and subsequent tariffs filed by the company and spp  these off system sales have been opened up to competition 
see competition below for more information 
the company s future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  regulation  the utilities change from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers 
inflation affects the company s operations in that historical costs rather than current replacement costs are recovered in the company s rates 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
merger related expenses  which are not tax deductible  contributed million to this increase 
a significant portion of these expenses include payments to the company s financial advisors for the first and second portions of the agreed upon transaction fee for their financial services in connection with the merger 
this agreement calls for payment of of the transaction fee upon execution of the merger agreement  upon stockholder approval of the merger and the remaining upon the consummation of the merger  payable upon closing 
including the final payment to be made under this agreement  remaining merger costs are expected to total approximately million 
total purchased power costs decreased by approximately million during  primarily due to increased availability of the company s generating units 
the asbury plant set a new continuous run record of days in total fuel costs were up approximately million during as compared to the same period in primarily reflecting the increased generation from the higher cost gas turbines at the state line power plant 
the hot temperatures in july and august resulted in a significant increase in the price of purchased power  making it more economical for the company to run its gas turbines during those months 
in addition  natural gas prices were higher by during as compared to  contributing to the increase 
other operating expenses decreased slightly by approximately million during  compared to maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during primarily due to decreased maintenance costs at asbury and riverton 
the riverton plant had a five year scheduled maintenance outage in these decreases offset maintenance and repairs expense resulting from a new year s day ice storm that interrupted service to approximately  of the company s missouri and kansas customers over a three day period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income during the current year 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year largely as a result of increased property taxes 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during  due primarily to the increased generation from gas fired combustion turbine units at both state line and the energy center 
this increased generation was due to increased customer demand in the second and third quarters of resulting from the warmer temperatures 
natural gas prices were lower by during as compared to  helping to offset some of the additional expense 
total purchased power costs increased slightly by approximately million during other operating expenses increased approximately million during  compared to  due primarily to increases in customer accounts expense and administrative and general expense 
approximately million of this increase was a one time charge due to the initiation of the directors stock unit plan  a stock based retirement compensation program for the company s directors 
maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during scheduled maintenance on combustion turbines at the energy center and the state line power plant accounted for approximately million of this increase while approximately million can be attributed to the first quarter spring maintenance outage at the asbury plant and the second quarter five year scheduled maintenance outage at the riverton plant 
transmission and distribution system maintenance contributed million to the increase 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total income taxes increased approximately million during due primarily to higher taxable income during the current year 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year largely as a result of increased property taxes and city taxes 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during  and during afudc increased significantly during reflecting higher levels of construction work in progress related to the state line project 
afudc decreased significantly during reflecting lower levels of construction work in progress due mainly to the completion of state line unit no 
in june see note of notes to financial statements under item interest charges on long term debt increased in both and due to the issuance of million of the company s unsecured senior notes in november and million of the company s first mortgage bonds in april the proceeds from the senior notes were added to the company s general funds and were used to repay short term indebtedness  including approximately million in commercial paper incurred in connection with the company s preferred stock redemption on august   as well as that incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
the proceeds from the company s first mortgage bonds were added to the company s general funds and were used to repay million of the company s first mortgage bonds due may  and to repay short term indebtedness  including that incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
commercial paper interest increased million during due to increased usage of short term debt for financing purposes  particularly in connection with the company s preferred stock redemption 
interest income for that year also increased  reflecting the higher balances of cash available for investment 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in earnings per share were down primarily due to the million in merger costs incurred during  as well as the million in excess consideration paid on redemption of the company s preferred stock 
earnings for were also negatively impacted by mild temperatures and increased interest expense 
excluding the million in merger costs  earnings per share would have been 
earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenue resulted mainly from the unusually warm second and third quarters of the arkansas rate increase and the missouri rate increase also favorably impacted the company s operating results in  as the missouri jurisdiction accounts for approximately of the on system retail sales of the company 
competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  oklahoma and arkansas are the only states in which the company operates that have taken any such action 
in missouri  the public service commission adopted an order in establishing a docket and creating a task force on retail electric competition 
the commission task force  on which the company was represented  was charged with preparing a comprehensive report for the commission on how missouri could implement retail electric competition 
the joint committee of the missouri legislature received testimony during and no legislative action was taken in there are bills pending in the missouri legislature  but no action is expected this year 
in kansas  although different bills have been introduced into the house and senate  no legislative action has been taken 
in oklahoma  the electric restructuring act of was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor 
the bill  with a target date of july   was designed to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state and move the state toward open competition for electric generation 
an electric utility task force has been studying all issues in oklahoma and has prepared legislation to provide a more comprehensive framework for the transition to retail open access 
that legislation is under consideration by the oklahoma general assembly 
approximately of the company s operating revenue was derived from sales subject to oklahoma regulation 
the arkansas legislature passed a bill in april that would deregulate the state s electricity industry as early as january a special provision  however  applies to utilities with a small portion of arkansas customers whose majority of customers are from another state 
this provision  which applies to the company  exempts the company from restructuring in arkansas until restructuring is enacted in missouri or until january   whichever comes first 
the bill would freeze rates for three years for residential and small business customers of utilities that seek to recover stranded costs  and freeze rates for one year for residential and small business customers of utilities  such as the company  that do not seek to recover stranded costs 
this freeze applies only to rate increases and does not apply to any fuel adjustment clause or energy cost recovery rider approved by the arkansas commission  such as the one the company has to recover its fuel and purchased power costs 
the bill also requires the unbundling of services on electric bills by june the company is currently engaged in the regulatory proceedings that have commenced as a result of the new law 
approximately of the company s operating revenue was derived from sales subject to arkansas regulation 
in april  the ferc issued order no 
order which required all electric utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services that they provide themselves 
the utility would have to take service under those tariffs for its own wholesale power transactions 
order required a functional unbundling of transmission and power marketing services 
the company and the spp have filed open access transmission tariffs covering these wholesale transmission services 
the spp tariff applies to most of the transmission services for which the company tariff was designed 
where that is the case  the company shares revenues received from such transmission services with other members of the spp based on a megawatt mile method of calculating transmission service charges 
there are  however  limited circumstances where the company tariff still applies and the company receives of the revenues from the transmission services 
the spp tariff will continue to apply unless and until a new tariff is filed as part of any regional transmission organization rto which the company may join as discussed below 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
order  which encourages the development of rtos 
rtos are designed to control the wholesale transmission services of the utilities in its region 
order is intended to continue the process of promoting open and more competitive markets in bulk power sales of electricity that was begun with order on december   spp filed with the ferc for recognition as an independent system operator and as an rto 
the company does not expect the implementation of order to have a significantly different impact on its results of operations than the implementation of order and the operation of the spp tariff had 
several factors exist which may enhance the company s ability to compete as deregulation occurs 
the company is able to generate and purchase power relatively inexpensively  during  the company s retail rates were approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  less than of the company s electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling 
at the same time  the company could face increased competitive pressure as a result of its reliance on relatively large amounts of purchased power and its extensive interconnections with neighboring utilities 
in addition  the company has continued its investments in non regulated businesses which it commenced in the company now leases capacity on its broadband fiber optics network and provides electronic monitored security  decorative lighting and other energy services 
year costs the company experienced no year related problems as it passed from to the company s total cost which includes the costs of a new financial management software package and a new customer information system to update all of its systems for year readiness was approximately million  of which approximately million was capitalized while million was expensed 
of these capitalized costs  million was included in the capital budget and million was included in the capital budget 
costs for specific year remediation projects were charged to expense while costs to replace software for business purposes other than addressing year issues were capitalized 
liquidity and capital resources the information discussed below in this section is presented without giving any effect to the company s proposed merger with utilicorp 
the company s construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
a breakdown of the company s construction expenditures is as follows construction expenditures amounts in millions new construction state line combined cycle unit distribution and transmission system additions combustion turbine improvements and upgrades additions and replacement asbury and riverton capitalized software costs fiber optics general and other additions total approximately of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations 
the company estimates that its construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  the company anticipates that it will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to the company s distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these construction expenditure estimates also include approximately million  million and million in  and respectively  for the construction of the state line combined cycle unit 
the total cost of construction at the state line combined cycle unit is estimated to be million 
the company s share of this amount  after the transfer to wgi of an undivided joint ownership interest in the existing state line unit no 
and certain other property at book value is expected to be approximately million 
for more information on the state line project see item  properties electric facilities 
wgi is responsible for of expenditures made by the company in connection with the construction and operation of the state line combined cycle unit 
in addition  wgi will continue to make monthly prepayments to the company for the future transfer of its joint ownership interest in the existing state line unit no 
 as well as an interest in certain underlying and surrounding land and other property and equipment now owned by the company 
these prepayments are reflected in state line advance payments on the balance sheet
