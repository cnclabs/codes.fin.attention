item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general scottish holdings is an insurance holding company  and our principal assets include the ownership of scottish insurance  harbourton and scottish annuity 
scottish holdings was formed on may   and scottish insurance was formed on june   under the laws of the cayman islands 
we commenced our insurance operations on november   immediately following our ipo 
harbourton was acquired effective as of september  and scottish annuity was acquired on december  results of operations the following table summarizes our net income period from year ended may  to december  december  revenues net premium reinsurance fees  interest income  net   variable life fees  insurance administration fees   realized losses on securities  net   total revenues   benefits and expenses interest credited and other policy benefits  acquisition expenses and other insurance expenses  operating expenses   total benefits and expenses   net income before benefit for federal income taxes   benefit for federal income taxes current deferred  net income   basic and diluted net income per oridnary share date of incorporation overview our net income of  or per share was driven by revenues from our investment portfolio and insurance administration fees 
our investment income in included  earned on our surplus and  earned in relation to our reinsurance activities 
comparisons to the prior period are not meaningful because of our limited period of operations after our november ipo 
investments our investment portfolio is managed by two professional investment managers  prudential investment corporation and gen re 
our investment guidelines are designed to diversify the portfolio to maximize investment income while minimizing risk 
at december   the portfolio had an average quality rating of aa  an average duration of years and an average book yield of 
at december   the portfolio had an average quality rating of aa  an average duration of years and an average book yield of 
our fixed maturity portfolio increased from  to  principally as a result of the reinsurance transactions and acquisition of harbourton 
the duration of our portfolio was reduced from years to years as investments of short duration were acquired to match the duration of liabilities acquired through our reinsurance operations 
the realized loss of  recorded for the year was due to portfolio restructuring 
as at december  we had unrealized depreciation of million  a result of the effect of the current interest rate environment on our fixed income portfolio 
insurance operations our business consists of two lines of business  variable life insurance and annuities  and life and annuity reinsurance 
prior to the acquisition of scottish annuity  we provided a variety of insurance administration  accounting and other services to scottish annuity 
during  we wrote our first variable life insurance contracts and entered into several reinsurance treaties 
the first treaty was a coinsurance transaction involving group long term disability claims for which we have established a reserve for policyholder benefits of approximately million 
this transaction involves a closed block of existing claims that were in effect as of june  the block consists of approximately  claimants who are receiving disability income payments 
no additional claimants may be added 
further  our liability is limited to income benefit payments only and does not include any health  medical or other types of payments 
under our second reinsurance agreement  we contracted to reinsure up to million of group funding agreement business 
this transaction was structured so that reserves would be transferred in four separate million tranches 
additionally  closing each tranch is subject to final approval by both parties 
we closed on the two first tranches in july and august 
subsequently  in mutual agreement with the ceding company  we elected to delay taking down the third and fourth tranches 
this decision does not reflect the quality of the reinsured business  but rather came as a result of adverse conditions in the overall market that were outside our control and that of the ceding company 
as of december   we have not taken down the third and fourth tranches 
as of year end  the business reinsured has perfomed as we had expected and  if market conditions permit  we will consider taking down the final two tranches 
on october  we closed our acquisition of harbourton 
harbourton provides us with a united states platform to write reinsurance business 
harbourton is licensed in states and the district of columbia and is an authorized reinsurer in an additional states 
harbourton has approximately million of annuity reinsurance in force as of year end subsequent to year end  we have hired reinsurance professionals to expand the reinsurance operations of harbourton 
while we expect to write short duration annuity reinsurance business in harbourton  the principal focus of new business in harbourton will be traditional life reinsurance 
in addition  we are in the process of changing the name of harbourton to scottish re us  inc 
we expect to have all required regulatory approvals for the name change by the end of the second quarter of in the fourth quarter we executed a letter of intent with lincoln national life insurance company  under which  beginning in february  scottish insurance will reinsure a share of the new fixed annuity business written by lincoln and sold through financial institutions 
the business  which is managed by first penn pacific life insurance company  is expected to generate million of reinsurance reserves during the treaty has subsequently been executed  reinsuring business sold on or after february  however no assurance can be given that these expectations can be achieved 
effective december  we acquired ownership of scottish annuity  which has approximately million of variable annuity business 
we had previously provided insurance administration and accounting services to scottish annuity under an administration agreement 
outlook our business consists of two lines of business  variable life insurance and annuity products  and annuity and life reinsuance 
both lines of business are designed to capitalize on our offshore location  which allows us to offer unique product features and competive pricing 
during the past year  we entered into several reinsurance agreements and we are pricing and underwriting several more 
in addition  the variable products business is beginning to grow more rapidly as we develop relationships with independent insurance brokers 
capital resources and liquidity at december   total capitalization was  in the third quarter we completed a stock repurchase program 
at its conclusion  we had repurchased  shares for  on october  we completed our acquisition of harbourton for  on december  we acquired scottish annuity for  we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures and do not anticipate incurring material indebtedness other than letters of credit  which may be required in the ordinary course of our planned reinsurance business 
during the year  we paid quarterly dividends of  or per share  to the shareholders of record as at june  and september  we also paid  or per share to shareholders of record as at december  we expect that our cash and investments  together with cash generated from our businesses  will provide sufficient sources of liquidity and capital to meet our needs for the next several years 
in addition  we have access to a combined million through available lines and letters of credit  none of which have been utilized to date 
year risk many computer programs used only two digits to identify a year in the date field prior to december  these programs  if not corrected  could have failed or created erroneous results by or at the year this year issue was believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations  including us 
because most of our computer hardware and software is less than three years old  we believed that our exposure with respect to our own computer systems to year related problems was not significant  and we encountered no year related problems 
we are continuing to monitor our systems and those of our primary suppliers of data 
changes in accounting standards the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june and requires adoption no later than fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the effect this standard will have on us 
we do not currently own any securities that would be subject to this statement

our variable life annuity insurance business is dependent upon referral sources 
we will not be successful in our variable life and annuity insurance business if we cannot get clients from referrals by financial advisors  investment managers  private bankers  attorneys and other intermediaries in the united states and elsewhere 
since scottish insurance and scottish annuity are not licensed or registered to do business in the us  these referral sources may not act as our agent  nor can they be compensated by us for any activities in the us as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement our insurance plans 
we can  however  pay non us referral sources for activities undertaken outside the us we expect to compensate referral sources based on a percentage of the revenue received from referrals 
subject to any regulatory limitations  we may provide referrals to persons or entities that provide referrals to us 
we cannot assure you that we will receive a significant amount of referrals or  if so  that any referrals will result in actual sales of variable life and annuity insurance policies 
our ability to develop our reinsurance business is dependent upon building relationships 
we will not be successful in our non traditional annuity and life reinsurance businesses if we cannot develop business primarily through relationships with reinsurance intermediaries  insurance consultants  members of the actuarial profession and senior insurance company executives 
our reinsurance business targets a competitive market 
the scottish insurance business plan for reinsurance activities provides that one of our principal targets is reinsuring blocks of in force fixed annuities issued by insurers that are no longer actively writing these contracts or that want to lessen the reserve and capital requirements associated with these contracts 
another principal target is reinsuring new issues of fixed annuities 
reinsurance of new business can be used to increase capacity  lessen reserve and capital requirements  improve the competativeness of the product  improve the return to the insurance company  or some combination of the above 
the harbourton business plan primarily targets reinsurance of mortality risk associated with life insurance products issued by us direct writers 
while sales of life reinsurance have increased dramatically in recent years  the market is also well established and competitive 
as the business targets of both scottish insurance and harbourton are addressed by several domestic and international reinsurers  we cannot be certain that it will meet our expectation 
our ability to develop our business plan is dependent upon maintaining our claims paying ability rating 
potential purchasers of insurance policies  insurers  reinsurers and insurance and reinsurance intermediaries use insurance ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers 
in addition  an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating will adversely affect a company purchasing reinsurance 
although duff phelps has assigned scottish insurance and harbourton a claims paying ability rating of a and am best has assigned both companies a rating of a excellent  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain these ratings 
if we are unable to maintain these ratings  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain similar claims paying ability ratings from other major rating agencies 
changes in us tax laws with respect to variable annuities and life insurance could adversely affect our product sales the tax treatment afforded annuity and life insurance products both variable and non variable by united states tax law is in many respects more favorable than the tax treatment of certain other investment alternatives  and is therefore a primary competitive feature of such products 
any material change in the current tax treatment of annuity or life insurance products  including the imposition of a flat tax or national sales tax in lieu of the current united states federal income tax structure  could adversely affect the market for variable annuities or life insurance products 
in addition  elimination of the federal estate tax has been proposed from time to time 
were the federal estate tax to be eliminated  the sale of life insurance products could be adversely affected 
the clinton administration s fiscal year budget proposal contains provisions that  if enacted into law  could adversely affect the sale of variable products 
first  the proposal would require the reporting of payments of more than  made to entities in identified tax havens 
it is not known if the cayman islands will be treated as an identified tax haven  but if so purchasers of variable policies issued by scottish insurance or scottish annuity will be required to provide certain information to the irs 
second  the proposal would require insurance companies to report to the irs items of income and gain with respect to a private separate account 
although the reporting requirements that would be imposed under this proposal would generally not apply to insurers that do not do business in the united states  the proposal indicates that the irs might take the position that a united states taxpayer that is the owner of a variable contract that is based on a private separate account ie  the separate account supports only a small number of insurance or annuity contracts will be treated as the owner of the assets held in the separate account for federal income tax purposes 
third  the proposal would reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of corporate owned life insurance 
finally  the proposal would eliminate the crummey rule  pursuant to which certain gifts to trusts for the payment of life insurance premiums are treated as present interests that are eligible for the annual exclusion from the gift tax 
the elimination of this rule would eliminate the primary and most efficient method of making premium payments by insurance trusts 
because we expect that insurance trusts will purchase our variable life insurance policies  or such policies will be contributed to trusts  to provide liquidity for estate taxes and to effect the transfer of assets from one generation to another  adoption of this proposal could adversely affect the sales of these policies  which could adversely affect our results of operation and our financial condition 
in its most recent business plan  the irs announced that it intends to issue guidance as to whether an annuity that is issued by an insurer that is not an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter l the provisions of the united states internal revenue code that apply to insurance companies that do business in the united states will be subject to the favorable tax treatment generally afforded annuity contracts  or instead will be treated as debt instruments that are not eligible for tax deferral 
were the irs to adopt a rule or regulation treating annuities issued by scottish insurance or scottish annuity  which do not do business in the united states  as debt instruments  the market for such annuities could be adversely affected 
governmental regulation could adversely affect our business 
scottish insurance and scottish annuity 
scottish insurance and scottish annuity are licensed as unrestricted class b insurers and are subject to regulation and supervision by the cayman islands monetary authority 
they are not registered or licensed to do business in any jurisdiction in the united states or any other country 
generally  the sale of insurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
under the operating guidelines  scottish insurance and scottish annuity do not operate in the united states or  to the extent prohibited  in any other country 
we can give no assurance that inquiries or challenges to our insurance activities will not be raised in the future 
scottish insurance s variable life insurance products have customized features that are not typically available from a company subject to those laws 
if scottish insurance were to become subject to those laws  our business  results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 
in the past  federal and state governments have proposed to regulate foreign insurers 
while none of these proposals has been adopted  we cannot assure you that federal or state legislation will not be enacted subjecting our business to supervision and regulation in the united states 
our reinsurance business could be adversely affected by uncertainties of letters of credit or other collateral amounts 
because many jurisdictions do not allow insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless appropriate security measures are in place  we anticipate that our reinsurance clients will typically require us to post a letter of credit or provide other collateral through a funds withheld or trust arrangement 
if we are unable to obtain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or are unable to arrange for such other collateral  our ability to operate our reinsurance business will be severely limited 
our products carry with them inherent insurance industry risks and risks specific to our business plan 
life reinsurance mortality risk 
the principal risk associated with our planned life reinsurance business is mortality risk 
harbourton will reinsure various forms of life insurance products including term life  universal life and traditional life insurance 
mortality risk typically is more stable when spread across large numbers of insureds 
as our life reinsurance business grows  we will initially have a relatively small number of lives covered and as a result  our mortality risk exposure is likely to be larger  and our probability of loss less predictable  than an insurer with a larger risk pool 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our actual mortality experience will be consistent with our pricing expectation 
mortality risk is also a factor in our variable life insurance product  however  currently we reinsure of the mortality risk on all variable life policies 
fixed annuity and life reinsurance investment risk 
the principal risk associated with our fixed annuity reinsurance activities is investment risk 
specifically  we are subject to the following risks 
the risk that invested assets supporting the reinsured business will decrease in value  
the credit risk that the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  
the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than expected  and 
the risk that we may have to sell assets at a loss to provide for policyholder withdrawals 
universal life insurance and similar policies sensitive to interest rates provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return based on applicable interest rates in effect from time to time 
as a result  the risks with respect to reinsuring those kinds of policies may also include investment risks similar to those for fixed annuities 
in addition  like annuities  life insurance policies and variable annuities are subject to surrender risk 
reinsurance business ceding insurer risk 
an additional risk associated with our reinsurance business is the risk that the ceding insurer will be unable to pay to us amounts due because of its own financial difficulties 
we can give no assurance that the ceding insurers will be able to pay amounts due to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we can give no assurance that the ceding companies will maintain appropriate interest crediting rates with respect to fixed annuities or interest rate sensitive life insurance policies 
our business is dependent on our ability to manage risks in our investment activities 
our fixed income investments are subject to the following two primary sources of investment risk 
credit risk  relating to the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  and 
interest rate risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you we will be able to effectively manage these risks 
if we are unable to effectively manage these risks  our ability to support our planned variable insurance and reinsurance businesses  and our results of operations and financial condition  will be adversely affected 
in addition  under our investment guidelines  we can invest up to of our investment portfolio in below investment grade fixed income securities 
while any investment carries some risk  the risks of investing in lower rated securities are greater than the risks of investing in investment grade securities 
in addition  we seek to invest the assets transferred to us to match our anticipated reinsurance liabilities 
we expect to invest these assets in fixed income and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
we may invest in foreign denominated securities to manage currency risk if the coinsurance transaction involves foreign currency 
we may also enter into interest rate swaps and other hedging transactions in an effort to manage interest rate risks 
we can not assure you that we will successfully structure our investments so as to match our anticipated reinsurance liabilities 
if our calculations are incorrect  or if we improperly structure our investments to match these liabilities  we could be forced to sell investments before they mature at a significant loss with the result that our assets may not be adequate to meet our needed reserves  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  because a portion of our planned business  including premiums  may be in currencies other than united states dollars and because we may maintain a small portion of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than united states dollars  we may have losses if we do not properly manage or otherwise hedge  our currency risks 
we have limited experience competing with established companies in the life insurance and reinsurance industry 
the life insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive and most of the companies in these industries are significantly larger  have operating histories and have access to significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
we have limited experience competing with these companies 
our business would be adversely affected by the imposition of or increases in united states taxes 
as cayman islands companies  scottish insurance and scottish annuity  we operate in a manner so that we are not subject to united states tax  other than withholding tax on certain investment income from united states sources 
however  the internal revenue service could contend that we are conducting business in the united states 
if the internal revenue service were to prevail in that contention  we would be subject to united states tax at regular corporate rates on taxable income that is effectively connected with united states business plus an additional branch profits tax on the income remaining after the regular tax  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
harbourton is a us licensed insurance company and is therefore subject to united states tax at regular corporate tax rates on taxable income 
any increase in united states taxes on income in harbourton could adversely affect our results of operation 
insurance and reinsurance premiums that will be paid to scottish insurance and scottish annuity will be subject to a us excise tax to the extent the underlying risks are located in the united states 
in addition  our investment income from united states sources could be subject to withholding tax 
these taxes could be increased and other taxes could be imposed on our business  which could also adversely affect our results of operation 
owners of our ordinary shares may in certain circumstances be exposed to adverse personal united states tax risks 
controlled foreign corporation rules 
each united states shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation who owns shares in the controlled foreign corporation on the last day of its taxable year generally must include in his gross income for united states federal income tax purposes his pro rata share of the controlled foreign corporation s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income has not been distributed 
for these purposes  any united states person who owns directly or indirectly or more of our ordinary shares will be considered to be a united states shareholder 
in general  a foreign insurance company such as our subsidiary  scottish insurance  is treated as a controlled foreign corporation only if such united states shareholders collectively own more than of the total combined voting power or total value of our stock for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any year 
we believe that  because of the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership among holders and because of the restrictions in our articles of association on transfer  issuance or repurchase of our ordinary shares  our shareholders will not be subject to treatment as united states shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation 
in addition  because under the articles of association no single shareholder will be permitted to exercise or more of our total combined voting power  our shareholders should not be viewed as united states shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of these rules 
there can be no assurance  however  that these rules will not apply to our shareholders 
related person insurance income risks 
if our related person insurance income  determined on a gross basis  were to equal or exceed of our gross insurance income in any taxable year  and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds were directly or indirectly to own more than of the voting power or value of our capital stock  a united states person who directly or indirectly owns our ordinary shares on the last day of the taxable year may be required to include in his income for united states federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of our related person insurance income for the taxable year  determined as if this income were distributed proportionately to the united states person at that date 
related person insurance income is generally underwriting premium and related investment income attributable to insurance or reinsurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are united states shareholders or are related to united states shareholders of the insurance company issuing the policies 
if we have related person insurance income  and all united states persons own or more of the voting power or value of our shares  any shareholder who is a united states person who owns or more of our shares and disposes of the shares would have any gain from the disposition generally treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s portion of our undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares 
the shareholder also will be required to follow certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to sales of our shares because we are not directly engaged in the insurance business and because proposed united states treasury regulations applicable to this situation appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business 
we can give no assurances however  that the irs will interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the proposed regulations will not be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of ordinary shares 
passive foreign investment company risks 
you will have adverse united states federal income tax consequences if we are deemed a passive foreign investment company 
in general  a foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company if or more of its income constitutes passive income or or more of its assets produces passive income 
passive income generally includes interest  dividends and other investment income 
however  passive income does not include income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent this income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
because we intend to continue to be in the insurance business and do not intend to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of our insurance business  we do not expect to be a passive foreign investment company 
we can give no assurance  however  that the irs or a court will agree in this view 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the success of our subsidiaries and regulatory constraints 
we are a holding company engaged in the variable insurance and reinsurance business through our wholly owned subsidiaries  scottish insurance  scottish annuity  and harbourton 
our principal source of income is dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends largely on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us 
scottish insurance and scottish annuity are subject to cayman islands regulatory constraints which also affect their ability to pay dividends to us 
specifically  scottish insurance and scottish annuity must keep enough capital to support its variable insurance and reinsurance businesses and comply with restrictions under cayman islands insurance corporate law 
accordingly  there is no assurance that dividends will be declared or paid in the future 
our articles of association contain substantial limitations on ownership  transfers and voting rights 
except as described below with respect to the purchase and sale of our shares on the nasdaq national market  our articles of association require our directors to decline to register any transfer of our shares if they believe that the transfer would result in a person or any group of which such person is a member beneficially owning  directly or indirectly  or more of our outstanding shares 
similar restrictions apply to our issuance and repurchase of shares 
the directors also may  in their absolute discretion  decline to register the transfer of any shares if they believe that the transfer may expose us  any subsidiary or shareholder or any person insured or reinsured or proposing to be insured or reinsured by us to adverse tax or regulatory treatment or if they believe that registration of the transfer under any federal or state securities law or under the laws of any other jurisdiction is required and the registration has not been done 
a transferor of ordinary shares will be deemed to own the shares for dividend  voting and reporting purposes until a transfer of the shares has been registered on our register of members 
we are authorized to request information from any holder or potential acquirer of our shares as necessary and may decline to register any transaction if we do not receive complete and accurate information 
our directors will not decline to register any transfer of our shares executed on the nasdaq national market 
however  if any transfer results in the transferee or any group beneficially owning  directly or indirectly  or more of any class of shares or causes our directors to have reason to believe that a transfer may expose us  any subsidiary or shareholder thereof or any person insured or reinsured or proposing to be insured or reinsured to adverse tax or regulatory treatment in any jurisdiction  under our articles of association  the directors have the power to deliver a notice to the transferee demanding that the transferee surrender to an agent  designated by the directors  certificates representing the shares and any dividends or distributions that the transferee has received as a result of owning the shares 
a transferee who has resold the shares before receiving this notice will be required to transfer to the agent the proceeds of the sale  to the extent such proceeds exceed the amount that the transferee paid for such shares  together with any dividends or distributions that the transferee received from us 
as soon as practicable after receiving the shares and any dividends or distributions that the transferee received  the agent will use its best efforts to sell the shares and any non cash dividends or distributions to the extent tradeable as market securities in an arm s length transaction on the nasdaq national market 
after applying the proceeds from such sale toward reimbursing the transferee for the price paid for such shares  the agent will pay any remaining proceeds and any cash dividends and distributions to organizations described in section c of the code that the directors designate 
the proceeds of any such sale by the agent or the surrender of dividends or distributions will not inure to our benefit or the agent s benefit  but the amounts may be used to reimburse expenses incurred by the agent in performing its duties 
in addition  the articles of association generally provide that any person or any group holding or more of the total voting rights of all of our outstanding capital shares  will have the voting rights of its voting shares reduced so that the person or group may not exercise more than approximately of the total voting rights 
because of the attribution provisions of the us tax code and the rules of the securities and exchange commission regarding determination of beneficial ownership  this requirement may have the effect of reducing the voting rights of a shareholder whether or not the shareholder directly holds of record or more of the voting shares 
the directors also have the authority to request from any shareholder certain information for the purpose of determining whether such shareholder s voting rights are to be reduced 
if the shareholder fails to respond to the notice  or submits incomplete or inaccurate information  the directors or their designee have the discretion to disregard all votes attached to the shareholder s ordinary shares 
our articles of association and cayman islands confidentiality laws have anti takeover effects 
our articles of association contain provisions that make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  a proxy fight or otherwise  including by reason of the limitation on transfers of ordinary shares and voting rights described above 
while these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control to negotiate with our board of directors  they could have the effect of discouraging a potential purchaser from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control 
cayman islands law restricts disclosure of  among other things  shareholder lists 
accordingly  such laws may make the acquisition of control by means of a tender offer or proxy fight more difficult 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our qualitative discussion about market risk is contained in the following sections

risk factors of investing in our ordinary shares our products carry with them inherent industry risks and risks specific to our business plan  
risk factors of investing in our ordinary shares our business is dependent on our ability to manage risks in our investment activities  and 
risk factors of investing in our ordinary shares our success may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
quantitative market risk relates to those financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity price 
scottish holdings portfolio is principally composed of fixed maturity bond investments 
these investments  by their nature  are subject to market value changes in relation to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk scottish holdings could incur losses on securities if it were required to liquidate during periods of volatile movements in interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to adverse interest rate movement through asset liability duration matching exercises  and by staggering the maturities of its fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
sensitivity anaylsis scottish holdings regularly conducts various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on its financial condition 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following table represents a summary of the par values of the company s financial investments at their expected maturity dates  the weighted average coupons by those maturity dates and the estimated fair value of those instruments for the period ended december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration par amortization for mortgage backed securities  call features and sinking fund features 
the estimated market value of available for sale securities is based on bid quotations from security dealers or on bid prices published in news quote services
