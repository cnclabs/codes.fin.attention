william h 
lyon is the son of william lyon and a director and an employee of the company 
the total purchase price consisted of approximately  in cash and the assumption of approximately  of liabilities of old william lyon homes 
the purchase price was determined based on the values as of december  of the real property and related assets acquired 
the parties intended that these assets  together with all income  receivables  escrow and other proceeds  purchase deposits  cash and other assets earned or received from any sale of these assets  including any assets acquired with sales proceeds  in the ordinary course of business since january  and through november  would inure to the buyer 
these amounts were to be net of any amounts used to pay or satisfy land acquisition or development costs  capital expenditures  principal or interest on indebtedness  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  employee wages and benefits  taxes and other liabilities and operating expenses and incurred in the ordinary course of business 
the company funded the asset purchase through borrowings from its existing working capital facility and the assumption of existing indebtedness on certain real estate projects that were acquired 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired amounting to approximately  has been reflected as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of seven years 
after the acquisition described above and prior to the effectiveness of the merger as described below  william lyon and william h 
lyon acquired  shares of the company s series a common stock for per share in a tender offer for the purchase of up to  shares of the company s series a common stock which closed on november  and  shares of the company s series b common stock for per share under agreements with certain holders of the company s series b common stock which closed on november  on november  william lyon and the company cancelled all of william lyon s outstanding options to purchase  shares of the company s series a common stock 
the completion of these transactions  together with the previous disposition on august  of  shares by william lyon and a trust of which william h 
lyon is the beneficiary  resulted in william lyon and a trust of which william h 
lyon is a beneficiary owning approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
the foregoing number of shares does not reflect the subsequent merger and the conversion of each share of series a and series b common stock into share of common stock as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the bond indenture agreement governing the company s senior notes which are due in  if the company s consolidated tangible net worth is less than million for two consecutive fiscal quarters  the company is required to offer to purchase million in principal amount of the senior notes 
because the company s consolidated tangible net worth has been less than million beginning with the quarter ended june   the company would  effective on december   june   december   june  and december   have been required to make offers to purchase million of the senior notes at par plus accrued interest  less the face amount of senior notes acquired by the company after september   march   september   march  and september   respectively 
the company acquired senior notes with a face amount of million after september  and prior to december   again after march  and prior to june   and again after september  and prior to december   again after march  and prior to june  and again after september  and prior to december  and therefore was not required to make offers to purchase senior notes 
as a result of these transactions  the company has recognized a net gain of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  after giving effect to income taxes and amortization of related loan costs 
every six months  until the company s consolidated tangible net worth is million or more at the end of a fiscal quarter  the company will be required to make similar offers to purchase million of senior notes 
at december   the company s consolidated tangible net worth was million 
the company s management has previously held discussions  and may in the future hold discussions  with representatives of the holders of the senior notes with respect to modifying this repurchase provision of the bond indenture agreement 
to date  no agreement has been reached to modify this repurchase provision 
any such change in the terms or conditions of the bond indenture agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority in principal amount of the senior notes outstanding 
no assurances can be given that any such change will be made 
because of the company s obligation to offer to purchase million in principal amount of the senior notes every six months so long as the company s consolidated tangible net worth is less than million  the company is restricted in its ability to acquire  hold and develop real estate projects 
the company changed its operating strategy during to finance certain projects by forming joint ventures with venture partners that would provide a substantial portion of the capital necessary to develop these projects 
the company believes that the use of joint venture partnerships better enables it to reduce its capital investments and risks in the highly capital intensive california markets  as well as to repurchase the company s senior notes as described above 
the company generally receives  after priority returns and capital distributions to its partners  approximately of the profits and losses  and cash flows from joint ventures 
as of december   the company and certain of its subsidiaries are general partners or members in nineteen joint ventures involved in the development and sale of residential projects 
such joint ventures are or less owned and  accordingly  the financial statements of such joint ventures are not consolidated in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for condensed combined financial information for these joint ventures 
based upon current estimates  substantially all future development and construction costs will be funded by the company s joint venture partners or from the proceeds of construction financing obtained by the joint ventures 
at december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million  of which million expires in  million expires in  million expires in  million expires in  million expires in and  expires in the company s ability to utilize the tax benefits associated with its net operating loss carryforwards will depend upon the amount of its otherwise taxable income and may be limited in the event of an ownership change under federal tax laws and regulations 
the ability of the company to meet its obligations on its indebtedness will depend to a large degree on its future performance which in turn will be subject  in part  to factors beyond its control  such as prevailing economic conditions  mortgage and other interest rates  weather  the occurrence of events such as landslides  soil subsidence and earthquakes that are uninsurable  not economically insurable or not subject to effective indemnification agreements  availability of labor and homebuilding materials  changes in governmental laws and regulations  and the availability and cost of lands for future development 
at this time  the company s degree of leverage may limit its ability to meet its obligations  withstand adverse business or other conditions and capitalize on business opportunities 
results of operations homes sold  closed and in backlog as of and for the periods presented are as follows as of and for years ended december  number of homes sold company    unconsolidated joint ventures number of homes closed company    unconsolidated joint ventures backlog of homes sold but not closed at end of period company unconsolidated joint ventures dollar amount of backlog of homes sold but not closed at end of period in millions company unconsolidated joint ventures homes in backlog are generally closed within three to six months 
the dollar amount of backlog of homes sold but not closed as of december  was million as compared to million as of december  and million as of september  the cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow at the company s projects was approximately during the number of homes closed in increased percent to  from  in net new home orders for the year ended december  increased percent to  units from  for the year ended december  the backlog of homes sold as of december  was  down slightly from units as of december   and down percent from units at september  the company s inventory of completed and unsold homes as of december  increased to units from units as of december  the improvement in net new home orders and closings for as compared with is primarily the result of improved market conditions in substantially all of the company s markets and additional sales locations as a result of new land acquisitions 
at december   the company had sales locations as compared to sales locations at december  financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  statement no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on assets to be held and used by the company when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets excluding interest are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
statement no 
also requires that long lived assets that are held for disposal be reported at the lower of the assets carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
under the new pronouncement  when an impairment loss is required for assets to be held and used by the company  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
the net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash charge of  during the second quarter of to record impairment losses on certain real estate assets held and used by the company 
the impairment losses related to three of the company s master planned communities 
the impairment losses related to two communities  which are located in the inland empire area of southern california  arose primarily from declines in home sales prices due to continued weak economic conditions and competitive pressures in that area of southern california 
the impairment loss relating to the other community  which is located in contra costa county in the east san francisco bay area of northern california  was primarily attributable to lower than expected cash flow relating to one of the high end residential products in this community and to a deterioration in the value of the non residential portion of the project 
the significant deteriorations in the market conditions associated with these communities resulted in the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest estimated to be generated by these communities being less than their historical book values 
accordingly  the master planned communities were written down to their estimated fair value 
the following represents the home sales and excess of revenue from sales over related cost of sales ie  gross profit of the three master planned communities since the recordation of impairment losses on june  for the for the for the six months ended year ended year ended december  december  december  sales    gross profit    gross profit the gross profits recognized on the three master planned communities subsequent to the recordation of the impairment losses has increased due to better than projected sales price increases beginning in the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine whether such assets have been impaired and therefore would be required to be adjusted to fair value 
fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions  as well as the availability of suitable financing to fund development and construction activities 
the realization of the company s real estate projects is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and  accordingly  the actual timing and amounts realized by the company may be materially different from the estimated fair values as described herein 
this annual report on form k does not attempt to discuss or describe all of the factors that influence or impact the evaluation of an impairment of the company s real estate assets 
interest incurred during the period in which real estate projects are not under development or during the period subsequent to the completion of product available for sale is expensed in the period incurred 
economic conditions in the real estate industry can cause a delay in the development of certain real estate projects and  as a result  can lengthen the periods when such projects are not under development and  accordingly  have a significant impact on profitability as a result of expensed interest 
interest expense during   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing prices 
interest rates  the length of time that assets remain in inventory  and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest cost 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices sufficiently to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  the company s sales  gross margins and net results may be adversely impacted 
to a limited extent  the company hedges against increases in interest costs by acquiring interest rate protection that locks in or caps interest rates for limited periods of time for mortgage financing for prospective homebuyers

inflation although inflation rates have been low in recent years  the company s revenues and profitability may be affected by increased inflation rates and other general economic conditions 
in periods of high inflation  demand for the company s homes may be reduced by increases in mortgage interest rates 
further  the company s profits will be affected by its ability to recover through higher sales prices increases in the costs of land  construction  labor and administrative expenses
