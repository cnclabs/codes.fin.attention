item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company the company s operating results are affected by company specific factors  primarily its refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds  seasonal factors  such as the demand for refined products and working capital requirements  and industry factors  such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices  the demand for and prices of refined products and industry supply capacity 
the effect of crude oil price changes on the company s operating results is determined  in part  by the rate at which refined product prices adjust to reflect such changes 
as a result  the company s earnings have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
in march  the company and phillips petroleum company terminated discussions related to the formation of a proposed joint venture diamond between the two companies 
during the first quarter of  the company expensed million of transaction costs incurred related to the formation of diamond  which costs are included in restructuring and other expenses for the year ended december  in december  the company finalized the sale of the michigan convenience stores  pipelines and terminals to marathon ashland and recognized a gain of million 
upon completion of the sale  the company permanently closed the alma refinery and recognized a loss of million  which included a million write down of assets and million of severance and closure costs 
the gain and loss have been included in restructuring and other expenses for the year ended december  also during  the company sold or closed convenience stores  including under performing convenience stores associated with the retail restructuring program and various other assets for a net gain of million 
the net gain is included in restructuring and other expenses for the year ended december  during  the company reduced the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventories by million to reduce such inventories to market value which was lower than the lifo carrying value 
during  the company reduced the carrying value of crude oil inventories by million due to the decline in crude oil prices in late these reductions in inventories are included in the cost of products sold and have been recognized as permanent reductions to the inventory balance as of december  and in june  the company terminated a proposed joint venture with petro canada

in december  the company finalized plans to eliminate approximately non essential jobs  programs and expenses and to implement new initiatives designed to further reduce capital employed and improve earnings 
as a result of these changes  the company recorded a million charge for severance costs associated with terminated employees which is included in restructuring and other expenses for the year ended december  seasonality in the northeast system  demand for refined products varies significantly during the year 
distillate demand during the first and fourth quarters can range from to above the average demand during the second and third quarters 
the substantial increase in demand for home heating oil during the winter months results in the company s northeast system having significantly higher accounts receivable and inventory levels during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
the company s us system is less affected by seasonal fluctuations in demand than its operations in the northeast system 
the working capital requirements of the us system  though substantial  show little fluctuation throughout the year 
both the us and northeast systems are impacted by the increased demand for gasoline during the summer driving season

us system the us system had operating income of million for the year ended december  as compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the unusual items discussed above significantly impacted operations 
sales and other revenues increased from to due primarily to the increase in refined product selling prices at both the wholesale and the retail levels 
refined product selling prices increased steadily throughout as crude oil costs rose from per barrel in january to per barrel by december  a increase 
in addition  the volumes of refined product sold increased approximately from to us refining operations in improved significantly over levels 
despite continuing reductions in industry refining margins everywhere but on the west coast  the company was able to improve refining realizations for the us system by favorably managing its crude oil and other feedstock acquisition activities particularly for crude oil purchases in the mid continent region where purchases are arranged approximately days in advance of delivery 
the wilmington refinery operated at full capacity during the second and third quarters when refining margins hit an all time high on the west coast as a result of significant operating problems at other west coast refineries 
in september  the west coast refining margins returned to more normal levels after other west coast refineries which had been shut down  were restarted and taken to full capacity 
in addition to the higher refinery margin  throughput at the wilmington refinery increased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to the debottlenecking of the fccu which was performed during the day turnaround in december operating costs per barrel at the wilmington refinery decreased to per barrel in from per barrel in as a result of higher throughput volumes and the cost reductions implemented in late throughput at the mid continent refineries dropped less than from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in even after operations at the alma refinery were suspended in october in  throughput and the refinery margin were adversely affected due to the downtime at the ardmore refinery after it sustained a power failure and fire in the fccu in july operating costs decreased per barrel from to due to lower utility expenses and other cost reductions 
the us retail operations were negatively impacted by the increase in crude oil prices and short term supply imbalances during which pushed wholesale gasoline prices up faster than retail pump prices 
consequently  the retail fuel margin decreased cents per gallon from to the decrease in the us retail merchandise margin was caused by increased cigarette prices in december and during which could not be fully passed on to customers 
on a positive note  merchandise sales per store improved from to as a result of closing and selling under performing company operated convenience stores

northeast system the northeast system had operating income of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the operating income is due primarily to lower refining margins and retail fuel margins from to despite a increase in sales and other revenues from to  the rising cost of crude oil during negatively impacted the quebec refinery s margin resulting in a decrease from per barrel in to per barrel in however  operating costs per barrel in as compared to decreased due to the cost reduction programs implemented at the beginning of which partially offset the impact of the reduced refining margin 
retail fuel volumes increased from to due to continued successful promotions programs 
the overall retail margin declined to cents per gallon in from cents per gallon in due to slightly lower margins in the home heating oil business which was caused by the warm winter  high inventories and the margin squeeze that resulted as crude oil prices rose during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million increased million from to due to additional selling expenses associated with higher sales volumes  severance payments and higher year end bonus accruals

the denver  ardmore and alma refineries contributed approximately  barrels per day during throughput for the ardmore refinery decreased from approximately  barrels per day during the first six months of to approximately  barrels per day during the last half of the year as a result of a power failure and fire in the main fractionation column in the plant s fccu which occurred in mid july the repair to the ardmore refinery fccu was completed in mid september the refining margin for the mid continent refineries of for the year ended december  decreased from in the decrease in the refining margin was caused by a scheduled day maintenance turnaround at the three rivers refinery  lower throughput from the ardmore refinery due to the fire in mid july and an unplanned repair of the fccu at the mckee refinery 
more significantly  refined product selling prices were negatively impacted by high industry inventories and decreased by more than the decrease in crude oil costs 
throughput at the wilmington refinery decreased to  barrels per day in from  barrels per day in in december  the refinery had significant downtime for scheduled maintenance turnarounds on the no 
coker and crude unit  the gas oil hydrotreater  and the fccu s alkylation unit 
these turnarounds caused approximately days of downtime during december and thus affected negatively per day throughput volumes 
the addition of new convenience stores in and and the acquisition of the high volume total stores in the third quarter of are major factors in for the increase in retail fuel volumes to  barrels per day and the increase in the daily merchandise sales to million per day 
the increase in retail fuel margins to cents per gallon in from cents per gallon in was due primarily to the termination of the frequent fueler stamp programs in the third quarter of the retail merchandise margins remained stable from to the adverse impact on retail merchandise sales from the heavy rains in california caused by el nino in early was offset by the increased rebate activity from soft drink and tobacco vendors in the third and fourth quarters of during  the petrochemical ngl businesses contributed to operating income at lower levels than in due to the declining prices of propylene and other petrochemicals which continue to be impacted by very weak economic conditions in asia and the far east

northeast system the northeast system had operating income of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the operating income is due primarily to the unusual items discussed in the general section above 
sales and other revenues in the northeast system totaled billion for as compared to billion in this decrease was caused by lower sales in the retail and wholesale segments following the mild winters in the first and fourth quarters of in the northeastern united states and eastern canada 
the lower sales were also directly affected by the reduced selling prices of refined products as a result of high industry inventories and low crude oil prices 
throughput at the quebec refinery increased to  barrels per day in from  barrels per day in the low throughput in was caused by a significant planned maintenance turnaround on the fccu in may and june the refinery margin increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in the scheduled maintenance turnaround in mid combined with lower crude oil costs achieved from favorable long term supply contracts contributed to the improved refinery margins 
retail fuel volumes remained level in as compared to at  barrels per day 
however  retail margins decreased to cents per gallon in from cents per gallon in the drop in retail margins was caused mainly from a decrease in demand for high margin home heating oil due to the mild winter of which was partially offset by a increase in demand for lower margin retail and cardlock products 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million decreased million from to principally due to continuing efforts to control administrative costs 
restructuring and other expenses include million of costs incurred related to the cancelled petro canada joint venture  million related to the severance benefits expensed in december for the terminated employees associated with the company s corporate restructuring and profit improvement program and million loss on the sale of assets during the year

the consolidated income tax provision for the year ended december  was based upon the company s effective income tax rate for the year of 
the consolidated effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effects of foreign operations  and the amortization of non deductible goodwill 
outlook the company s earnings depend largely on refining and retail margins 
the petroleum refining and marketing industry has been and continues to be volatile and highly competitive 
the cost of crude oil purchased by the company as well as the price of refined products sold by the company have fluctuated widely in the past 
as a result of the historic volatility of refining and retail margins and the fact that they are affected by numerous diverse factors  it is impossible to predict future margin levels 
refining margins during the fourth quarter of declined from year ago levels due to a continued increase in the price of crude oil  combined with lower overall demand in gasoline and distillates 
gasoline demand was seasonally lower than the third quarter of while distillate demand was lower due to yet another mild winter  especially in eastern canada and the northeastern part of the united states where the company operates its home heating oil business 
refiners cut production levels in december in response to the lower refining margins 
the decrease in refining utilization did help in lowering the gasoline and distillate inventories on a national level 
moving into the first quarter of  crude oil prices once again moved higher in response to rumors that opec and other major producers will not increase production until the summer of this rumor caused an already tight market to push the price of crude oil to per barrel in mid february new sulfur requirements in europe are helping the distillate margin as jet fuel is needed to lower the sulfur content of diesel fuel in that market 
this has benefited the us refiners in the form of lower foreign imports 
refining fundamentals are showing continued improvement as inventories of gasoline and distillates are at or below fifteen year lows during the normal refinery turnaround season 
this should help increase refining margins from year ago levels in both the first and second quarters of retail fuel margins were negatively impacted in as retail pump prices did not keep pace with rising crude oil costs and wholesale gasoline prices 
this pressure is continuing into the first quarter of as demand decreases during the winter season 
however  winter finally arrived in eastern canada and the northeastern united states in january resulting in sharply higher heating oil prices as demand reduced inventory levels to four year lows 
merchandise margins in the first quarter of are expected to move incrementally higher than the average of as the company moves into the second phase of its marketing strategy 
in december  the company announced plans to improve earnings by million in these improvements include continued expense reductions  refinery yield and throughput improvements and increased merchandise contributions from retail 
the announced improvements should help the company achieve its goal of increasing return on capital employed roce in a low margin environment

exchange rates the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has weakened substantially since the acquisition of the canadian operations in during  the canadian dollar improved against the us dollar from at december  to at december  however  as the company s canadian operations are in a net asset position  the weaker canadian dollar has reduced  in us dollars  the company s net equity as of december   by million 
although the company expects the exchange rate to fluctuate during  it cannot reasonably predict its future movement 
with the exception of its crude oil costs which are us dollar denominated  fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate will affect the us dollar amount of revenues and related costs and expenses reported by the canadian operations 
the potential impact on the refining margin of fluctuating exchange rates together with us dollar denominated crude oil costs is mitigated by the company s pricing policies in the northeast system  which generally pass on any change in the cost of crude oil 
retail margins  on the other hand  have been adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations as competitive pressures have  from time to time  limited the company s ability to promptly pass on the increased costs to the ultimate consumer 
the company has considered various strategies to manage currency risk  and it hedges the canadian currency risk when such hedging is considered economically appropriate 
year issue the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change has not been fully recognized 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively affected if its key suppliers  vendors and customers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its key suppliers  vendors and customers 
as of december   the company incurred and expensed approximately million related to the remediation and testing of all company systems for year purposes and the development of year contingency plans

in august  the company implemented a new stand alone  year compatible  enterprise wide information technology it system for the northeast system 
effective february   this new enterprise wide it system was implemented in the us system because it offers superior technological enhancements and operating efficiencies not available in the existing us it system

as of december   the company had incurred million of costs related to the new it system 
see certain forward looking statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has stabilized in recent years 
however  it is still a factor in the united states and canadian economies and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and or increase the costs of supplies and labor 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company has and will continue to pass along increased costs to its customers 
in addition  the company is affected by volatility in the cost of crude oil and refined products as market conditions continue to be the primary factor in determining the costs of the company s refined products 
throughout  the price of crude oil and refined products increased significantly from levels 
the cost of refined products sold by the company  as reported in its consolidated financial statements  approximates current cost since the company uses the lifo method to account for most of its inventories 
however  the sharp rises in crude oil and refined product prices during outpaced retail pump prices  which negatively impacted retail fuel margins for the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices related to crude oil  refined products and natural gas 
to manage or reduce these market risks  the company uses interest rate swaps  foreign exchange contracts  and commodity futures and price swap contracts 
the company s policies allow using derivatives for the purchase of physical quantities of crude oil and refined products as well as for the management of crude oil costs 
generally  the derivatives relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment 
during  as part of the company s crude oil procurement activities  commodity futures contracts were used to manage the price of crude oil supplied to its mid continent refineries 
the company has from time to time  on a very limited basis  used derivative instruments for trading purposes  however  the gains and losses from such activities have been immaterial 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures in derivative financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under revolving credit facilities do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings have maturities of less than three months 
the carrying amount of the company s floating interest rate debt approximates fair value 
generally  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is managed by obtaining debt that has a floating interest rate or using interest rate swaps to change fixed interest rate debt to floating interest rate debt 
generally  the company maintains floating interest rate debt of between and of total debt 
since mid  the federal reserve has raised interest rates on three different occasions and is biased towards continued rate increases as long as the economy remains in an expansion mode 
as a result  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt is declining as shown in the following tables 
the following table provides information about the company s long term debt and interest rate swaps  both of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for long term debt  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  after consideration of refinancing  are presented 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date

average interest rate n a floating rate average interest rate n a interest rate swaps fixed to floating average pay rate n a average receive rate n a foreign currency risk the company periodically enters into short term foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on the trade payables of its canadian operations that are denominated in us dollars 
these contracts involve the exchange of canadian and us currency at future dates 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset losses and gains on the us dollar denominated trade payables 
at december   the company had short term foreign exchange contracts totaling million and commitments to purchase million of us dollars 
the company s exposure to market risk is minimal on these contracts as they matured in early january the company does not hedge for the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of its foreign results of operations or financial position 
commodity price risk the company is subject to the market risk associated with changes in market prices of its underlying crude oil  refined products and natural gas inventories  however  such changes in values are generally offset by changes in the sales price of the company s refined products 
price swaps are price hedges for which gains and losses are recognized when the hedged transactions occur  however  losses are recognized when future prices are not expected to recover 
during  the company purchased billion of crude oil to supply its various refineries 
in conjunction with these purchases  the company entered into commodity futures contracts 
the commodity futures contracts are generally satisfied by the company taking physical delivery of the underlying crude oil or refined product  however  there are contracts which are closed without taking physical delivery of the underlying barrels 
as of december  and  the company did not hold any commodity futures contracts not designated as hedges 
however during  the company reduced its crude oil cost by million associated with such contracts not designated as hedges which are marked to market value and recognized currently in cost of products sold 
as of december   the company had outstanding commodity futures contracts designated as hedges and price swap contracts to purchase million and sell million of crude oil and refined products or to settle differences between a fixed price and market price on aggregate notional quantities of million barrels of crude oil and refined products which mature on various dates through june as of december   the company had outstanding commodity futures contracts designated as hedges and price swap contracts to purchase million and sell million of crude oil and refined products or to settle differences between a fixed price and market price on aggregate notional quantities of million barrels of crude oil and refined products which mature on various dates through june the fair value of commodity futures contracts designated as hedges is based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of price swap contracts is determined by comparing the contract price with current broker quotes for futures contracts corresponding to the period that the anticipated transactions are expected to occur 
the information below reflects the company s futures contracts and price swaps that are sensitive to changes in crude oil  refined product or natural gas commodity prices 
the tables present the notional amounts in barrels for crude oil and refined product or mmbtu for natural gas  the weighted average contract prices and the total contract amount by expected maturity dates 
contract amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments and quantity of barrels of crude oil or mmbtu of natural gas to be exchanged under the futures contract
