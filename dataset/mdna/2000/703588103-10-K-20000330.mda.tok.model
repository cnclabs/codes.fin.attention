item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
due to the company s significant level of investments in fixed maturity securities bonds  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position  although the company also has limited exposure to equity price risk 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s financial activities as of december  caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used below and because unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are not included in the hypothetical effects of changes in market conditions discussed below 
as of december  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent of the company s total liabilities and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents of the company s total assets 
interest rate risk the company employees a conservative investment strategy emphasizing asset quality and the matching of maturities of its fixed maturity investments to the company s anticipated claim payments  expenditures and other liabilities 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio includes investments in cmo s which are exposed to accelerated prepayment risk generally caused by interest rate movements

as of december   notes payable and notes payable to bank account for of total liabilities 
the company s fixed maturity investments  including cmos  notes payable and notes payable to bank are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  cmo prepayment rates  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions utilized in computing fair values as of december  should interest rates decline  mortgage holders are more likely to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates 
acceleration of repayments could adversely affect future investment income  if reinvestment of the cash received from repayments is in lower yielding securities 
such changes in prepayment rates are not taken into account in the following disclosures

as of december   equity securities represent of the company s total assets 
the carrying values of publicly traded investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of the investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the carrying values of privately held investments are subject to equity price risks which are based on the foregoing market price considerations and also on the underlying value of the issuer and other buyer s perceptions of such value  as well as lack of liquidity considerations 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of december  and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and decrease in the market prices as of december  the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios
