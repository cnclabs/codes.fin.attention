in  accounts receivable from customers have been collected on average within days 
this represents an increase of days in terms of average days to collect receivables from customers

page forward looking information and factors affecting future performance this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities and exchange commission act of for this purpose  any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of idx systems corporation to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements including among others  the factors set forth below 
if any risk or uncertainty identified in the following factors actually occurs  idx s business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of idx s common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of the money you paid to buy idx s common stock 
the following important factors affect idx s business and operations generally or affect more than one segment of our business and operations idx stock prices may continue to be volatile 
idx has experienced  and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its stock price due to a variety of factors including delay in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors such as consolidation  management changes and regulatory developments  market prices of competitors  announcements of technological innovations  including internet delivery of information and use of alication service provider technology  new product introductions by idx or its competitors  market conditions particularly in the computer software and internet industries  and healthcare reform measures and healthcare regulation 
these fluctuations have had a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  and may have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may affect operating results as follows ability to transact stock acquisitions  and ability to retain and incent key employees 
adverse financial trends including declining net income and cash from operations have and may continue 
year over year net income and cash from operations have generally declined since in  idx generated a net loss of approximately million 
if these negative trends continue  idx will have difficulty financing future growth and funding operating initiatives  including future acquisitions 
idx expects its quarterly operating results to fluctuate and its customer sales and installation requirements to change 
idx expects its quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate 
because a significant percentage of idx s expenses are relatively fixed  the following factors could cause these fluctuations delay in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors such as consolidation and management changes  delay in customers purchasing decisions due to customers year problems  the volume and timing of systems sales and installations  recognizing revenue at various points during the installation process  the timing of new product and service introductions and product upgrade releases  and the sales and implementation cycles of idx s customers 
in light of the above  idx believes that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful or reliable indicators of future performance 
page idx may not be successful in implementing its acquisition strategy 
idx intends to continue to grow in part through either acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses or alliances with complementary businesses 
idx may not be successful in these acquisitions or alliances  or in integrating any such acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses into its current business and operations 
factors which may affect idx s ability to expand successfully include the generation of sufficient financing to fund potential acquisitions and alliances  the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses  effective integration and operation of the acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses despite technical difficulties  geographic limitations and personnel issues  and overcoming significant competition for acquisition and alliance opportunities from companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
idx s success depends on new product development and its ability to respond to rapidly changing technology 
to be successful  idx must enhance its existing products  respond effectively to technology changes and help its clients adopt new technologies 
in addition  idx must introduce new products and technologies to meet the evolving needs of its clients in the healthcare information systems market 
idx may have difficulty in accomplishing this because of the continuing evolution of industry standards  for example  transaction standards pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  and the creation of new technological developments  for example  internet and application service provider technology 
idx is currently devoting significant resources toward the development of enhancements to its existing products  particularly in the area of internet based functionality and the migration of existing products to new hardware and software platforms  including relational database technology  object oriented programming and application service provider technology 
however  idx may not successfully complete these product developments or the adaptation in a timely fashion  and idx s current or future products may not satisfy the needs of the healthcare information systems market 
any of these developments may adversely affect idx s competitive position or render its products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
political  economic and regulatory changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry may cause idx to suffer financially 
idx currently derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of financial  administrative and clinical healthcare information systems and related services within the healthcare industry 
as a result  the success of idx is dependent in part on the political and economic conditions in the healthcare industry 
virtually all of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship operate in the healthcare industry and  as a result  are subject to governmental regulation  including medicare and medicaid regulation 
accordingly  idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship are affected by changes in such regulations and limitations in governmental spending for medicare and medicaid programs 
recent actions by congress have limited governmental spending for the medicare and medicaid programs  limited payments to hospitals and other providers under such programs  and increased emphasis on competition and other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship 
in addition  federal and state legislatures have considered proposals to reform the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
if enacted  these proposals could increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship 
idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship could react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for idx s products and services 
page in addition  many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for idx s products and services 
if idx is forced to reduce its prices  its operating margins would decrease 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring each customer will become greater 
there is intense competition in the market for healthcare information systems and if idx fails to compete successfully  it will suffer financially 
the market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
idx believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and product offerings  the features and capabilities of the systems  the price of system and product offerings  the ongoing support for the systems  and the potential for enhancements and future compatible products 
some of the idx s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than idx  and some of its competitors offer products that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include cerner corporation  eclipsys corporation  mckesson hboc  inc and shared medical systems corporation  each of which offers a suite of products that compete with many of idx s products 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing products 
many of idx s competitors have also announced or introduced internet strategies that will compete with idx s internet applications and services 
idx may be unable to compete successfully against these organizations 
in addition  idx expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
idx may be faced with product liability claims exceeding its insurance coverage 
any failure by idx s products that provide applications relating to patient medical histories and treatment plans could expose idx to product liability claims 
these potential claims may exceed idx s current insurance coverage 
unsuccessful claims could be costly to defend and divert management time and resources 
in addition  idx cannot assure you that it will continue to have appropriate insurance available to it in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
idx s success is significantly dependent on key personnel 
the success of idx is dependent to a significant degree on its key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
to be successful idx must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including programmers  consultants  systems architects skilled in the technical environments in which idx s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense 
idx does not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of its executives 
not all idx personnel have executed noncompetition agreements 
government regulation may impose burdens and costs on idx s operations 
virtually all of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship operate in the healthcare industry and  as a result  are subject to governmental regulation 
because idx s products and services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement systems currently in place in the united states  and because idx is pursuing a strategy of developing and marketing products and services that support its customers regulatory and compliance efforts  idx may become subject to the reach of  and liability under  these regulations 
page the federal anti kickback law  among other things  prohibits the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for medicare  medicaid and certain other federal or state healthcare program patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by the federal health care programs 
violations of the federal anti kickback law may result in civil and criminal sanction and liability  including the temporary or permanent exclusion of the violator from government health programs  treble damages and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation 
if the activities of a customer of idx or other entity with which idx has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the federal anti kickback law and idx  as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity  was found to have knowingly participated in such activities  idx could be subject to sanction or liability under such laws  including the exclusion of idx from government health programs 
as a result of exclusion from government health programs  idx customers would not be permitted to make any payments to idx 
the federal civil false claims act and the medicare medicaid civil money penalties regulations prohibit  among other things  the filing of claims for services that were not provided as claimed  which were for services that were not medically necessary  or which were otherwise false or fraudulent 
violations of these laws may result in civil damages  including treble and civil penalties up to  for each false claim filed 
in addition the medicare medicaid and other federal statutes provide for criminal penalties for such false claims  including fines of up to  and imprisonment up to five years for each offense 
if  as a result of the provision by idx of products or services to its customers or other entities with which idx has a business relationship  idx provides assists with the provision of inaccurate financial reports to the government under these regulations  or idx is found to have knowingly recorded or reported data relating to inappropriate payments made to a healthcare provider  idx could be subject to liability under these laws 
hipaa contains provisions regarding standardization  privacy  security  and administrative simplification in healthcare 
as a result of regulations now proposed under hipaa  idx will make investments to support customer operations in areas  such as electronic data transactions  computer system security  and patient privacy 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of regulations under hipaa  idx has made and expects to continue to make investments in product enhancements to support customer operations that are regulated by hipaa 
responding to hipaa s impact may require idx to make investments in new products or charge higher prices 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation or regulation 
the united states food and drug administration has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  idx  as a manufacturer of such products  could be required  depending on the product  to register and list its products with the fda  notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products  or obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending on the intended use of a device  the fda could require idx to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness  or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires this data  idx would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete 
idx cannot provide assurances that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  these products would be subject to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
page although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  idx expects that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions like service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
system errors in idx s healthcare information systems could cause unforeseen liabilities 
idx s healthcare information systems are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  idx s healthcare information systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
idx s healthcare information systems are intended to provide information to healthcare providers for use in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of idx s products may have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
failure of an idx customer s system to perform in accordance with its documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and require idx to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation 
if such failure is not timely remedied  it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract and subject idx to liability 
claims by other companies that idx s products infringe their proprietary rights could hinder or block idx s ability to sell its products  subject idx to significant monetary liability and divert the time and attention of its management 
if any of idx s products violate third party proprietary rights  idx may be required to reengineer its products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering its products without substantial reengineering 
any efforts to reengineer idx s products or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful  in which case idx may be forced to stop selling the infringing product or remove the infringing functionality or feature 
idx may also become subject to damage awards as a result of infringing the proprietary rights of others  which could cause idx to incur additional losses and have an adverse impact on its financial position 
idx does not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technologies used in its products infringe patents held by others 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
idx s competitive position would be adversely affected if it were unable to protect its proprietary technology 
idx s success and competitiveness are dependent to a significant degree on the protection of its proprietary technology 
idx relies primarily on a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect its proprietary technology 
despite these precautions  others may be able to copy or reverse engineer aspects of idx s products  to obtain and use information that idx regards as proprietary or to independently develop similar technology 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend idx s proprietary technology or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 
idx may have conflicts of interests with some of its executives 
richard e 
tarrant  president  chief executive officer and director  and robert h 
hoehl  chairman of the board of directors  indirectly own  through various entities  real estate which idx leases in connection with its operations 
during  idx paid an aggregate of approximately million in connection with these leases 
idx is currently negotiating to contract to purchase its headquarters facilities in south burlington  vermont from a real estate entity owned by richard e 
tarrant and robert h 
hoehl for a purchase price of approximately million 
idx has commenced a million construction project to expand its office facilities at that location 
in connection with these arrangements  the economic interests of these executives and directors and idx may diverge 
page the following important factors affect our internet services and content business segement or channelhealth business channelhealth s limited operating history may make it difficult to value and evaluate its business and future prospects 
channelhealth commenced operations october and only recently commercially released its first product 
an evaluation of the risks and uncertainties of channelhealth s business will be difficult because of channelhealth s limited operating history 
in addition  channelhealth s limited operating history means that it has less insight into how technological and market trends may affect its business 
the revenue and income potential of channelhealth s business and market are unproven  and its business model is emerging and unproven 
channelhealth s business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties typically encountered by businesses in their early stages of development  particularly those in new and rapidly evolving markets such the internet healthcare information industry 
channelhealth has incurred substantial losses to date and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
channelhealth has incurred losses since it began operations 
channelhealth incurred a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of and a net loss of million for the year ended december   and its accumulated deficit through december  was million 
channelhealth cannot be certain if or when it will become profitable 
channelhealth s failure to become profitable within the timeframe expected by idx investors or at all may adversely affect the market price of idx common stock 
channelhealth expects to continue to increase its expenses in an effort to develop its business and  as a result  will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability 
even if channelhealth does achieve profitability  there can be no assurance that channelhealth can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
currently  channelhealth s business depends on integrating internet related technology into its customers businesses  and  as a result  its business will suffer if use of the internet as a means for commerce declines 
if commerce on the internet does not continue to grow or grows slower than expected  the need for channelhealth s internet healthcare information products and services could decline  resulting in fewer projects and reduced revenues 
consumers and businesses may reject the internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons  including actual or perceived lack of security of information  lack of access and ease of use  congestion of internet traffic or other usage delays  inconsistent quality of service  increase in access costs to the internet  evolving government regulation  uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership  costs associated with the obsolescence of existing infrastructure  and economic viability of the internet commerce model 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results 
the adoption of internet solutions by healthcare participants will require the acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
the healthcare industry  in particular  relies on legacy systems that may be unable to benefit from channelhealth s internet healthcare information services 
to maximize the benefits of channelhealth s services  healthcare participants must be willing to allow sensitive information to be stored in channelhealth s databases 
channelhealth can process transactions for healthcare participants that maintain information on their own proprietary databases 
however  the benefits of channelhealth s connectivity and sophisticated services are limited under these circumstances 
customers using legacy and client server systems may refuse to adopt new systems when they have made extensive investment in hardware  software and training for older systems 
page government regulation could adversely affect channelhealth s business 
channelhealth s business will be subject to government regulation 
existing as well as new laws and regulations could adversely affect its business 
laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other on line services covering issues such as user privacy  system security  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
demand for channelhealth s applications and services may be adversely affected by additional regulation of the internet 
if channelhealth systems experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure  channelhealth s reputation and business will suffer 
a material security breach could damage channelhealth s reputation  cause users to lose confidence in channelhealth s systems or result in liability 
channelhealth will retain confidential customer and patient information in its processing centers 
channelhealth may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of internet security could deter people from using the internet or from conducting transactions that involve transmitting confidential information  including confidential healthcare information 
therefore  it is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
any damage to channelhealth s reputation or loss of user confidence as a result of a security breach could reduce the willingness of patients and physicians to use channelhealth s products and services and as a result  adversely affect channelhealth s business 
channelhealth depends upon a single transaction service provider to provide most of channelhealth s transaction services and if that provider is unable or unwilling to provide such services  channelhealth may not be able to provide service to its customers 
channelhealth currently relies on proxymed for most of its electronic transaction services 
channelhealth s reliance on a single provider of these services exposes channelhealth  and idx as a reseller of channelhealth s products and services  to a number of risks  including the loss of customer goodwill and possible liability  if proxymed fails to provide transaction services 
if proxymed is unable or unwilling to provide such services to channelhealth on a timely basis  channelhealth may be forced to engage additional or replacement providers  which could result in additional expenses and delays and disruptions in channelhealth s service 
performance problems with the systems of channelhealth s transaction  service and content providers could harm channelhealth s business 
channelhealth will depend on service and content providers to provide transactions and information on a timely basis 
channelhealth s web sites could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information 
in addition  channelhealth s customers will depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
all of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to channelhealth s systems 
any significant interruptions in channelhealth s services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing customers  strategic partners  advertisers or sponsors and  if sustained or repeated  would likely reduce the attractiveness of channelhealth s services

due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
