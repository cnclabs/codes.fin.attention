ii funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
see selected financial data 
in march  nareit issued a white paper analysis to address certain interpretive issues under its definition of ffo 
the white paper provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
in october  nareit revised the definition of ffo to include gains and losses from sales of properties and non recurring events 
this revised definition is effective for all periods beginning on or after january  since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
the following table presents the company s ffo calculation for the years ended december  in thousands income before preferred dividends and distributions  limited partners interest in the operating partnership and extraordinary loss    less preferred dividends and distributions   extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in the operating partnership of  and  respectively   limited partners minority interest in the operating partnership    net income available to common shareholders    adjustments for funds from operations add limited partners minority interest in the operating partnership    real estate depreciation and amortization    minority interests in consolidated partnerships   extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in the operating partnership of  and  respectively   less gain on sales of real estate  amount distributed to minority partners in consolidated partnerships    basic funds from operations    add dilutive preferred dividends and distributions   diluted fund from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    diluted weighted average shares units outstanding    assumes conversion of limited partnership units of the operating partnership
