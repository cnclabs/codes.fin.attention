of the total reserve additions of million  approximately million related to incurred costs for periods prior to these reserve additions represent revisions to estimates of the company s incurred medical costs based on information gained in the process of reviewing and reconciling previously delayed claims and claims paid or denied in error 
these revised estimates resulted from significant increases in medical costs in prior periods in the company s commercial  medicare  medicaid and new york individual plans that exceeded prior estimates 
health care services expense for and also included provisions of million and million  respectively  related to valuation reserves established in respect of provider advances 
as part of its turnaround plan  the company decided to restructure its medicare arrangements and or withdraw from medicare in the counties where the medicare business was not profitable and to withdraw from the medicaid business entirely 
premium deficiency reserves totaling million were established in the second quarter of and charged to health care services expense 
based on the company s decision to restructure or withdraw from these businesses by the end of  the reserves were determined by estimating the premium deficiency for the remainder of the company entered into an agreement to dispose of its remaining medicaid business in the fourth quarter of  completed two medicare risk transfer agreements late in the third quarter of and notified hcfa in the fourth quarter of of its intention to withdraw from medicare in certain counties effective january  under the two risk sharing arrangements the company transferred a substantial portion of the medical cost risk associated with the provision of medical services to certain of the company s medicare members to a network management company in one case and an integrated health care system in the other

as part of the turnaround plan  the company decided that it was not in a position to make the investment in noncore markets required to achieve normalized operating results 
accordingly  the company decided to withdraw from certain states  namely pennsylvania  new hampshire  florida and illinois  and focus on its core businesses of commercial and medicare membership in new york  new jersey and connecticut 
the company was prohibited by the various state regulators from simply canceling the outstanding policies and immediately withdrawing from these noncore markets 
as a result  the company was required to continue to service the outstanding policies 
using these assumptions  the premium deficiency reserve aggregating million was established for the noncore businesses in accordance with sfas and the aicpa healthcare audit guide 
the company recognizes premium deficiency reserves based upon expected premium revenue  medical expense and administrative expense levels and remaining contractual obligations using the company s historical experience 
the company evaluated the necessity for premium deficiency reserves in periods prior to and concluded that no reserves were required since  at that time  the company was projecting marginal profits or immaterial losses on these businesses based on normalized premiums and medical and administrative expense levels 
the projections that had previously shown marginal profits or immaterial losses on these businesses contemplated growth in the underlying business to support administrative expense levels  premium increases  reductions in medical costs resulting from improved medical management  systems and operational improvements and revised provider contracts 
results in the fourth quarter of were affected by the establishment of an additional million in medical claims reserves for disputed claims  a million provision for anticipated losses on individual products and net accruals of million for certain other medical expense liabilities  partially offset by favorable medical reserve adjustments of million arising from recent claims experience which showed better than expected medical costs during  principally in the company s medicare business

these settlements are not associated with specific dates of service 
the million provision for losses on individual products reflected an expected premium deficiency arising from the company s decision to seek an approximately increase in premium on its new york individual products  instead of seeking a higher increase which would involve uncertainties associated with the requirement of a public rate hearing

the company s paid and received claims data and revised estimates showed significant increases in medical costs in  and for the company s commercial  medicare  medicaid and new york individual plans 
these increases resulted primarily from higher expenses for hospital and specialist physician services and increases in per member per month pharmacy costs 
results for continued to reflect high costs in these areas 
the company s turnaround plan was designed to address the operating losses incurred in these lines of business 
moreover  improvement of results in the new york mandated plans will require increases in rates or additional cost control measures that require nysid approval 
the company expects to continue to experience losses in these plans 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to million during the year compared with million during the year the increase in was primarily attributable to a million rise in payroll and benefits due to higher average staffing levels through the first half of and an million increase in consulting fees primarily related to enhancements to management information systems offset  in part  by significantly lower marketing expenses for advertising and member acquisition 
marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percent of operating revenue were during compared with during marketing  general and administrative expenses included million and million in and  respectively  related to provisions for uncollectible notes and accounts receivable 
the increase in was primarily a result of increases in termination of nonpaying commercial members and groups  the exiting of noncore markets and the exiting and restructuring of medicaid and medicare programs  which make it more difficult for the company to collect amounts due on notes and accounts receivable 
the company s turnaround plan called for significant reductions in administrative costs 
the company expects that results for may continue to be adversely affected by high administrative costs 
moreover  the company may decide to increase certain administrative costs to attempt to improve service levels 
administrative costs in future periods may also be adversely affected by costs associated with responding to regulatory inquiries  investigations and defending pending securities class actions  shareholder derivative and other litigation  including fees and disbursements of counsel and other experts  to the extent such costs are not reimbursed under existing policies of insurance and exceed existing accruals 
there can be no assurance that ultimate costs will not exceed those estimates 
see legal proceedings 
the company s ability to control administrative costs could also be adversely affected by a continuation of the high level of employee attrition that the company has experienced over the last several quarters

in and  the company expensed a total of million and million  respectively  for graduate medical education  and the company expensed a total of million and million  respectively  for hospital bad debt and charity care 
because these payment obligations were not offset by corresponding reductions in payments to hospitals and others  the company believes its costs have increased 
it is not possible to determine the precise impact  however  due to changes made in the company s hospital contracts and the effect of overall changes in hospital costs during the period 
the company incurred interest and other financing charges of million in related to the issuance of million in bridge financing in the first quarter of and million of long term debt in may interest expense on capital leases entered into in aggregated million

the company s future results will continue to reflect interest payments by the company on delayed claims as well as interest expense on outstanding indebtedness incurred in during the second quarter of  the company incurred a net loss of million 
at that time  the company evaluated the deferred tax assets arising from the net loss and established a full valuation allowance pending the results of its turnaround plan

the company employs various means to reduce the negative effects of inflation 
the company has increased overall commercial premium rates when practicable in order to attempt to maintain margins 
the company s cost control measures and risk sharing arrangements with various health care providers as well as its withdrawal from participation in state medicaid programs may mitigate the effects of inflation on its operations 
there is no assurance that the company s efforts to reduce the impact of inflation will be successful or that the company will be able to increase premiums to offset cost increases associated with providing health care

nysid has announced an intention to strengthen current solvency regulations to allow nysid to take over failing health plans without a court order  however  capitalization requirements continue to be subject to state interpretation from time to time 
the company believes that the current capitalization of the subsidiaries is sufficient to meet these requirements 
the new jersey state legislature has passed legislation that includes a million assessment on hmos in the state based on market share and to be collected over a three year period 
although the company does not anticipate that this assessment will have a material impact on its operations  the assessment may result in the necessity of making a capital contribution to oxford nj in an amount up to approximately million 
as a result of delays in claims payments in prior periods  the company experienced a significant increase in medical claims payable 
the increase in medical costs payable was mitigated by progress in paying backlogged claims  by making advance payments to providers and through reductions in ibnr relating to the company s exit from certain businesses during the first quarter of and thereafter 
outstanding provider advances amounted to million  net of a million valuation reserve  at december  and are netted against medical costs payable in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes that it will be able to recover the net outstanding advance payments  either through repayment by the provider or application against future claims 
the company s medical costs payable was million including million of ibnr as of december   before netting advance claim payments of million compared with million including million for ibnr as of december   before netting advance claim payments of million 
the company estimates the amount of its ibnr reserves using standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical data  including the average intervals between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and paid  denied claims activity  expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
the liability is also affected by shared risk arrangements  including arrangements relating to the company s medicare business in certain counties and private practice partnerships partnerships 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the transfer of risk for certain medicare members and the experience of risk sharing partnership providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits 
in the case of the north shore medicare risk arrangement described below  the company no longer records a reserve for claims liability since the payment obligation has been transferred to north shore 
the company has reviewed its partnership program and has terminated most of its partnership arrangements as a result of difficulties and expense associated with administering the program as well as other considerations 
the company believes that its reserves for medical costs payable are adequate to satisfy its ultimate claim liabilities 
however  the company s prior rapid growth  delays in paying claims  paying or denying claims in error and changing speed of payment may affect the company s ability to rely on historical information in making ibnr reserve estimates 
in an effort to control increasing medical costs in its medicare programs  the company has an agreement with north shore long island jewish health systems north shore pursuant to which it has transferred to north shore a substantial portion of the medical cost risk associated with its approximately  medicare members in certain new york counties where it had experienced substantial losses 
the company and north shore have made progress in resolving certain initial operational difficulties 
the company bears the risk of nonperformance or default by north shore  and the failure of the north shore arrangement could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
a similar agreement covering new jersey medicare members was terminated in july the company is currently in arbitration proceedings to resolve the new jersey agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes a significant amount of assets whose fair value is subject to market risk 
since a substantial portion of the company s investments are in fixed income securities  interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
interest rates are managed within a tight duration band  to years  and credit risk is managed by investing in us government obligations and in corporate debt securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio 
the company s investment in equity securities as of december  was not significant 
in order to determine the sensitivity of the company s investment portfolio to changes in market risk  valuation estimates were made on each security in the portfolio using a duration model 
duration models measure the expected change in security market prices arising from hypothetical movements in market interest rates 
convexity further adjusts the estimated price change by mathematically correcting the changes in duration as market interest rates shift 
the model used industry standard calculations of security duration and convexity as provided by third party vendors such as bloomberg and yield book 
for certain structured notes  callable corporate notes  and callable agency bonds  the duration calculation utilized an option adjusted approach  which helps to ensure that hypothetical interest rate movements are applied in a consistent way to securities that have embedded call and put features 
the model assumed that changes in interest rates were the result of parallel shifts in the yield curve 
therefore  the same basis point change was applied to all maturities in the portfolio 
the change in valuation was tested using positive and negative adjustments in yield of and basis points 
hypothetical immediate increases of and basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december  respectively 
hypothetical immediate decreases of and basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s investment in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
because duration and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities  there can be no assurance that the company s portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values
