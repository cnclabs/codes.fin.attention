the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including the timing of acquisitions and expansion opportunities  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from current results or tlc s anticipated future results 
see the company s reports filed with the toronto stock exchange and the us securities and exchange commission from time to time for cautionary statements identifying important factors with respect to such forward looking statements  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially from results referred to in forward looking statements 
tlc assumes no obligation to update the information contained in this annual report 
outlook market based upon the growth of the laser vision correction market over the past several years  it has been forecasted by industry sources that more than  laser vision correction procedures will be performed during the year if  each year  only two percent of the laser vision correction population in the united states  had laser vision correction performed on both eyes  then based on the company s current prices  the us market would be more than billion annually 
the continuing growth of the laser vision correction industry is dependent upon the increasing acceptance of the procedure in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that laser vision correction will continue to be widely accepted by ophthalmologists  optometrists or the general population as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive disorders 
business development strategy tlc will continue to work with local optometrists to expand the co management model  which has been a successful strategy for the company and the optometric community over the last few years 
the company believes that its affiliated doctor network  which includes approximately  optometrists and ophthalmologists  is the largest such network in the laser vision correction industry 
the company will continue to increase its market penetration through opening new facilities and acquiring the business assets of existing practices 
tlc s senior executive team regularly examines acquisition and development opportunities in the refractive market and has identified opportunities in the united states to form strategic relationships with leading practitioners 
finally the company continues to develop and review its various strategic initiatives to ensure an acceptable return on expenditures 
as the market acceptance of laser vision correction continues to increase  tlc believes competition among service providers will grow and candidates for laser vision correction will increasingly select a provider based on factors other than solely the advice of a doctor 
while in recent quarters growth has slowed  the company believes brand recognition will be a key factor for provider selection  and  consequently  tlc is developing a strong reputation and brand recognition 
tlc has dedicated greater resources towards enhancing its marketing programs directed at network doctors and the public to increase tlc s brand recognition 
tlc believes it will enhance its brand recognition through the endorsement of tlc by such well known personalities as tiger woods and se ri pak 
the company continues to undertake joint marketing programs with affiliated doctors 
the company s marketing materials educate the public on laser vision correction as well as promote tlc s position as a clinical leader in providing laser vision services 
tlc has also developed innovative marketing programs including the corporate advantage program  which is directed at vision plans  large employers  and employee associations to provide tlc with preferred access to large employee groups 
employers participating in this program may subsidize the cost of an employee s refractive surgery at a tlc center and the procedure may be provided at a discounted price 
the cost to the employer of the subsidy may be offset by reductions in the ongoing cost of providing eyeglasses or other conventional vision correction 
in addition many employees consider the availability of laser vision correction as a significant enhancement to an employer s benefit plan 
tlc has further developed marketing programs directed at third party providers 
these third party providers include such organizations and businesses as  insurance companies and other related entities 
the third party providers that have affiliated with tlc represent over million lives through both corporate and individual members 
these providers complement the corporate advantage program by enabling tlc to directly market to these individuals exclusively and to provide them with opportunity to have laser vision correction at the company s centers at a preferred rate 
competition laser vision correction is subject to intense competition and the company competes with other entities  including hospitals  individual ophthalmologists and other laser centers 
in addition  laser vision correction competes with other surgical and non surgical treatments for refractive disorders  including eyeglasses  contact lenses  corneal rings  intra ocular lenses and other technologies currently under development 
the company believes that as the market acceptance for laser vision correction continues to increase  brand recognition will be an increasingly key factor for provider selection 
consequently  the company is developing a strong reputation and brand recognition 
tlc faces competition in many of its markets and the company s refractive centers compete on the basis of quality of service  reputation  brand recognition as well as price 
tlc s brand recognition and strong reputation for high level of service and quality of care allows tlc to command a higher price 
although some competitors charge less for laser vision correction  the company strives to be the premium provider in the laser vision correction industry and will not compete solely on price 
however  market conditions may compel the company to lower its prices to remain competitive in some markets 
in addition  further competition could develop if a significant decrease in the price of excimer laser systems were to occur  because the high price of such equipment is currently a barrier to entry for many potential competitors  particularly individual ophthalmologists 
other business segments tlc has continued to support its e commerce internet subsidiary  eyevantage 
com in its efforts to become the leading supplier of e commerce services designed specifically for the eye care industry 
eyevantage 
com is designed to link the company s refractive centers and affiliated ophthalmologists and optometrists with third party suppliers of goods and services 
eyevantage 
com has made several acquisitions designed to enhance its position in the market place 
the company continues to evaluate the potential of this subsidiary and other opportunities 
stock price fluctuation the stock prices of emerging high technology stocks are subject to significant fluctuations 
the stock price may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to lower than expected growth in procedure volume  lower pricing  and higher costs associated with the high growth and market expansion 
in addition  if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on the company s stock price
