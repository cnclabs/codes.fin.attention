item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we design  manufacture  sell and support fault tolerant enterprise storage solutions that protect and ensure access to an organization s critical data 
our products include high performance  fault tolerant storage subsystems that meet a wide range of customer applications for open systems based networks  such as nt  unix and linux operating systems 
our fault tolerant enterprise storage solutions address all three storage markets das  in which the storage device is connected directly to a server  nas  in which the storage device is installed on a network  and san  in which the storage device is used in a specialized network 
these connectivity options provide our customers the flexibility to choose and deploy a particular storage solution to meet their needs 
as data requirements change  customers can migrate their existing storage investments to different connectivity options 
during  we shifted our sales and marketing focus to the development of our direct sales channel from our previous use of alternate channel partners 
our direct sales force concentrates on sales to e commerce and other commercial end users  and the us air force and other federal government end users 
our direct sales force also recruits vars and assists them in their sales to commercial end users 
during the three years prior to  we had focused our sales and marketing efforts through our primary alternate channel partners  unisys and tandem 
as a result of industry consolidation and competitive factors  sales to unisys and tandem declined significantly in we do not expect sales to these alternate channel partners to constitute a significant part of our net sales in although our product development efforts are focused on commercial end users  we believe that several of our products under development could attract the interest of large data users and alternate channel partners  including oems  as the significant software component of these products will allow them to be easily integrated into other storage solutions 
we are presently undertaking a software development effort to create a file aware storage architecture for our future products 
file aware storage products possess embedded intelligence that obviates the need for a server which  in turn  provides for increased performance and lower costs 
our software based implementation of a file aware storage architecture will also incorporate our fault tolerance expertise  allow users to integrate our products with those from other vendors and provide for the migration of our storage to das  nas and san architectures as a customer requires 
we believe our planned software based offering provides many features and capabilities not currently available in the storage marketplace 
we anticipate that the commercial sector will continue to be our fastest growing sales channel 
sales to commercial customers grew from  in the first quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of in the last year  our sales to e commerce companies have increased by approximately as compared to such sales constituted of all sales to commercial customers in we anticipate that sales to e commerce customers will continue to grow rapidly as the data storage needs of these companies expand and we develop our direct sales channel to target this market 
on april   we announced that our net sales for the quarter ended march  are expected to range from  to  which is expected to result in a net loss of  to  for the quarter 
these results are due primarily to lower sales to the us air force through federal integrators 
commercial sales  while up from the first quarter  are also expected to be lower than the fourth quarter level 
sales to the us air force accounted for approximately of net sales in although we do not anticipate that the us air force will continue to purchase from us at historical levels  either in absolute dollars or as a percentage of net sales  we believe that sales to the us air force will continue to comprise a significant portion of our net sales 
quarterly fluctuations in sales to the us air force are the result of several factors over which we have no control  including funding appropriations and departmental approvals 
we cannot be certain that our sales to the us air force through federal integrators will not be adversely affected by the investigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the net sales derived from each of our sales channels year ended december  direct commercial and other federal customers    us air us    indirect alternate channel partners    direct sales include sales through regional and local resellers 
all sales to the us air force are through federal integrators 
federal integrators are government contractors who sell directly to us government entities 
indirect sales include sales through oems and national resellers 
revenue product sales revenue is generally recognized upon product shipment 
periodically  revenue is recognized for product which is being held at the customer s request 
revenue is only recognized on such product when all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has no specific performance obligations remaining 
service revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
revenue related to maintenance contracts is recognized over the respective terms of the maintenance contracts 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue relating to product sales consists primarily of o the costs of purchased material  o direct labor and related overhead expenses  and o amortization of capitalized software 
capitalized software amounts are amortized commencing with product introduction on a straight line basis utilizing the estimated economic life ranging from one to three years 
the profitability of any particular quarter is significantly affected by the relative sales levels of each of our primary sales channels and types of customers in such quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of o salaries  commissions and travel costs for sales and marketing personnel  including trade shows  and o expenses associated with our management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to significantly increase in connection with the expansion of our marketing efforts and our direct sales force 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to software and hardware engineers 
research and development expenses are anticipated to significantly increase to enable us to update and expand upon our product offerings 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for software development costs which are capitalized after technological feasibility has been demonstrated 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  direct net sales commercial and other federal customers us air us indirect net sales alternate channel partners total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses research development expenses operating income loss net interest expense income income loss before extraordinary item and tax benefit extraordinary item benefit for income taxes net loss income our operating results are affected by several factors  particularly the spending fluctuations of our largest customers  including the us air force 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of our costs  a decline in net sales in any fiscal quarter will have a material adverse effect on that quarter s results of operations 
we do not expect such spending fluctuations to be altered in the foreseeable future

as of december   available credit under such line towards future inventory purchases was  we have net operating loss nol carryovers for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which will begin to expire in we also have research and development tax credit carryovers for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which will begin to expire in in addition  we have alternative minimum tax credits of approximately these credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we experienced a change in ownership in as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  future use of some of these nols and income tax credits may be limited 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately  of state nol carryforwards and of research and development tax credit carryforwards to an unrelated third party for approximately we have approximately  of remaining state nol carryforwards which will begin to expire in and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of as of december under sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is established  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been provided to off set our net deferred tax assets since we are in a cumulative loss position 
we will periodically reassess the valuation allowance 
we believe that our existing available cash  credit facilities and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
through december   the company capitalized approximately  in connection with software and hardware acquired to address the year the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
