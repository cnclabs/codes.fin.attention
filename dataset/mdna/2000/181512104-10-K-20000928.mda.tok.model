item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to explain the major factors and variances between periods of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes which begin on page introduction a majority of the company s revenue is derived from the production and licensing of television programming 
the company s television programming is licensed to the major television networks  cable networks  program distributors  domestic and foreign syndicators and advertisers 
the company also receives production fees from program buyers who retain ownership of the programming 
in addition  the company derives revenue from the rerun broadcast of its programs on network and cable television and in foreign markets as well as the licensing of its media and film archives to third parties for use in theatrical films  television movies  specials and commercials 
the company  on a limited basis  also develops theatrical films in association with established studios that generally provide the financing necessary for production 
the company also derives substantial revenue from its restaurant business dcri and its subsidiaries 
this business segment contributed approximately  and to the company s consolidated revenue for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
license fees for the production of television programming are generally paid to the company pursuant to license agreements during production and upon availability and delivery of the completed program or shortly thereafter 
revenue from network and cable television license agreements is recognized for financial statement purposes upon availability and delivery of each program or episode in the case of a series 
revenue from rerun broadcast both domestic and foreign is recognized for each program when it becomes contractually available for broadcast 
production costs of television programs are capitalized and charged to operations on an individual program basis in the ratio that the current year s gross revenue bears to management s estimate of the total revenue for each program from all sources 
substantially all television production costs are amortized in the initial year of delivery  except for those successful television series and television movies where there is likely to be future revenue earned in domestic and foreign syndication and other markets 
successful television series and television movies can achieve substantial revenue from rerun broadcasts in both foreign and domestic markets after their initial broadcast  thereby allowing a portion of the production costs to be amortized against future revenue 
distribution costs of television programs are expensed in the period incurred 
depending upon the type of contract  revenue for dcci is recognized when the services are completed for a live event  when a tape or film is delivered to a customer  when services are completed pursuant to a particular phase of a contract which provides for periodic payments  or as may be otherwise provided in a particular contract 
costs of individual dcci productions are capitalized and expensed as revenue is recognized 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources are more than adequate to meet its current working capital requirements 
the company had cash and marketable securities of approximately  as of june  compared to  as of june  the company has no outstanding bank borrowings or other indebtedness for borrowed money 
marketable securities consist primarily of investments in united states treasury bills and treasury notes 
the company classifies investments in marketable securities as held to maturity  and carries these investments at cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires investments in debt and equity securities  other than debt securities classified as held to maturity  to be reported at fair value 
historically  the company has funded its investment in television program costs primarily through installment payments of license fees and minimum guaranteed license payments from program buyers 
to the extent the company produces television movies and television series  the company may be required to finance the portion of its program costs for these programs not covered by guaranteed license payments from program buyers known in the television industry as deficit financing 
none of the company s television production in fiscal or required material deficit financing by the company 
the company incurred deficit financing in connection with the production of a children s series delivered in fiscal no programs which are currently in development are anticipated to require material deficit financing 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
there was no net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal  and net cash provided by financing activities was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the fluctuations in cash provided by operations and cash used for investing activities for those years primarily reflect changes in production activity  the construction of two and the sale of one dick clark s american bandstand grill restaurants in fiscal  the construction of one restaurant in fiscal  and changes in the company s investment in marketable securities 
the fluctuations in cash provided by financing activities are the result of differing numbers of stock options exercised in a particular year 
the company expects to accomplish future growth of the restaurant division through a focus on licensing agreements requiring little or no capital outlay 
however  the company expects that the opening of any additional owned and operated american bandstand grill restaurants would be financed from available capital and or alternative financing methods such as joint ventures and limited recourse borrowings 
capital requirements for the company s corporate events and communications business  dcci  are anticipated to be immaterial to the company s overall capital position in fiscal the company expects that its available capital base and cash generated from operations will be more than sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
results of operations revenue revenue for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to higher revenue from television series  specials programming  and communications projects  offset in part by decreased revenue in same store sales from restaurant operations 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to lower revenue from television series and specials production as well as reduced revenue from restaurant operations 
during fiscal  revenue from one recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue  and revenue from one television series represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from one recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue and revenue from one television series represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from one recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue and revenue from two different television series each represented approximately of total revenue 
no other production or project accounted for more than of total revenue for fiscal  or gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of increased profitability in television series production 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of lower profitability in television specials and restaurant operations 
general administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in capitalized production overhead to television series production  offset in part by increased bonus compensation 
general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of reduced bonus compensation  offset in part by increased personnel costs for restaurant operations 
impairment of long lived assets as a result of declining operating results in three of the restaurant units during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the evaluation of future operating performance in these units  as required by the financial accounting standards board s sfas no 
 in fiscal  the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of  related to the writedown of the company s investment in these units 
the company considered continued and projected underperformance in these units and changes in market conditions to be the primary indicators of potential impairment 
the impairment charge was recognized as the future projected undiscounted cash flows for these units were estimated to be insufficient to recover the related carrying value of the long lived assets relating to the units 
as a result  the carrying values of the assets for two of the restaurants were written down to their estimated fair values based on the projected discounted cash flows 
assets of the third restaurant unit were written down to their estimated disposal value  the majority of which were disposed of in fiscal other minority interest expense increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a legal settlement received related to the american bandstand club in reno  nevada  and as a result of a major sale of the company s previously produced super bloopers and new practical jokes 
the c c joint venture  of which the company has a interest  produced the super bloopers and new practical jokes television specials 
the bloopers specials currently being produced by the company do not include the practical joke segments and are owned by the company and there is  therefore  no minority interest expense associated with their production 
minority interest expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the planned dissolution of the joint venture associated with the closing of the american bandstand club in reno  nevada 
general other operating data ebitda is earnings before interest and other income  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and other non cash items 
non cash items  such as asset writedowns and impairment losses  are excluded from ebitda as these items do not impact operating results on a recurring basis 
ebitda is presented supplementally because management believes it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or liquidity as promulgated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states such as net income or cash provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities nor should it be considered as an indicator of the overall financial performance of the company 
the company s calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited
