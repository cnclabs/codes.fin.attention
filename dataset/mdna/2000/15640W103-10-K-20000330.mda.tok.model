linux embedded database database for information appliances we expect the majority of our net revenues to come from these products for the foreseeable future 
if we do not deliver products as scheduled  or if the marketplace does not accept our products  our operating results  market share and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our products are distributed in the united states and internationally through a corporate sales organization 
we approach our markets through a combination of direct sales  where our sales force and consulting organization work directly with customers to provide e business and information appliance solutions to business process problems  and through sales channels  which consist of information systems integrators  or sis  independent software vendors  or isvs and distributors 
sis and isvs can collectively be considered value added resellers or vars 
you should read item risk factors  our failure to timely deliver our products and services or to achieve market acceptance may result in negative publicity and losses  software errors in some of our products may cause our future sales to decrease  if the computer industry shifts away from information appliances and e business software  demand for our products may decrease significantly  and the information appliance and e business software market is highly competitive  and we risk losing our market share to other companies  for more information on our products  the marketplace and associated risks 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from primarily two sources  across many industries product license revenue  derived primarily from product sales to resellers and end users  including large scale enterprises  and royalty revenue  derived primarily from initial license fees and ongoing royalties from product sales by original equipment manufacturer  or oems  and service and support revenue  derived primarily from providing software updates  support  training  and consulting services to end users 
we adopted the provisions of statement of position  or sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sop  effective january  we also adopted sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  in the first quarter of prior to  we recognized revenue under sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop and sop  we recognize product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
for certain sales where the licensing fee is not due until the customer deploys the software  revenue is recognized when the customer reports to us that the software has been deployed 
estimated product returns are recorded upon recognition of revenue from customers having rights of return and are based on our historical experience with these customers 
in  our revenue recognition policy for licensing fees was the same as set forth above 
if stock rotation requests from customers and distributors are significantly in excess of our estimates  our revenues and consequently results from operations will be adversely affected 
you should read the information included in part i  risk factors the information appliance and e business software market is highly competitive and we risk losing our market share to other companies of this annual report on form k 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg deliverable products  maintenance and other services  we allocate revenue to the undelivered components of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us  or for products not yet being sold separately  the price established by management 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenue set forth above are met 
we recognize revenue from maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance contract 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
for revenue allocated to training and consulting services  or derived from the separate sales of these services  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
when services are deemed essential to acceptance of the software being delivered  we defer revenue and recognize it over the period of the engagement on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on labor hours incurred 
in  our revenue recognition policy for training  consulting and support services was the same as set forth above 
we recognize product revenue from royalty payments from oems as product is sold and reported to us 
we operate with virtually no order backlog as our products ship shortly after orders are received 
our quarterly product revenue is therefore dependent on orders booked and shipped within any given quarter 
our product revenue  and as a consequence  operating results have tended to be higher in the fourth quarter of any given year compared with the first quarter of the following year 
historically  a substantial portion of our orders  and therefore revenue is booked in the third month of each quarter 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in orders of our products in relation to our expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition

results of operations the table below shows the consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
the results of operations of raima corporation after june  are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  years ended december  net revenues product service total net revenues cost of revenues product service amortization of acquired technology total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing engineering and product development general and administrative amortization of goodwill acquisition expense restructuring expense total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net provision for income taxes net income loss gross margin on product revenues gross margin on service revenues net revenues net product revenues the following table presents our net product revenues by product line and the approximate percentage of total revenues for the years ended december    and in of in of in of millions total millions total millions total embedded databases application development environment other tools and connectivity software total net product revenue 
net product revenues decreased million  or from to  and decreased million  or from to the decrease in overall product revenues from to is due to decreased revenues from embedded database and application development software 
the embedded database software revenue decreased million  or from to  primarily due to decreased sales of sqlbase  an embedded database product primarily utilized in desktop client server applications  which declined during this period 
this decline was partially offset by revenue from the velocis database server and rdm products  also embedded database products  which are primarily utilized in server centric and embedded device applications  respectively 
application development software decreased million  or from to due principally to decreases in centura team developer ctd revenue  our flagship application environment 
this decrease is due principally to the absence of significantly competitive new version releases of ctd in recent years 
the revenue from other tools and connectivity software decreased million from to and includes revenue from ancillary products 
there is no significant revenue reported from esnapp as this was only released in the latter part of the fourth quarter of the decrease in product revenue from to is due principally to decreases in application development software revenue 
revenue from ctd declined million  or from to this decrease is again due principally to the absence of significantly competitive new version releases of ctd in recent years 
the revenue from other tools and connectivity software decreased million from to and includes revenue from ancillary products  not central to our current strategic business direction 
the decline in embedded database revenue from to is due entirely to decreases in sqlbase revenue that declined during this period 
we attribute the decrease in sqlbase revenue to a flattening  and in some markets a shrinking  of the market for desktop client server applications as customers migrate these types of applications to scalable web centric environments 
we anticipate that this trend will continue 
we also anticipate that revenue from velocis database server  together with information appliance oriented product solution sets  which may include our current solution sets of rdm  db 
linux and the esnapp connectivity architecture  will provide at least a partial offset to declines in sqlbase revenue 
we are developing new releases of ctd that will provide a robust gl  object oriented development environment for web centric applications development 
we believe this product set will be competitive in the e business  web centric application development environment market 
delays or difficulties associated with new products or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

the following table presents our net revenues split by geographical regions in of in of in of millions total millions total millions total north america europe rest of world total net revenues international sales represented  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a key component of our strategy is continued expansion into international markets  and we currently anticipate that international sales  particularly in new and emerging markets  will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues 
we will need to retain effective distributors  and hire  retain and motivate qualified personnel internationally to maintain and or expand our international presence 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully market  sell  localize and deliver our products in international markets

cost and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes the cost of production and the amortization of capitalized software 
the cost of production includes the cost of subcontracted production and royalties for third party software 
the table below presents these costs for the years ended december   and in millions cost of production amortization of capitalized software total cost of product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues  excluding amortization of capitalized software cost of product revenue as a percentage of net product revenue decreased from to due to a decrease in royalties  and write offs of development licenses in compare with the increase in cost of product revenue as a percentage of net product revenue in compared with is due primarily to an increase in of royalties and the write off of development licenses for product that had been released from development 
we capitalize internal software development costs that are eligible for capitalization  from the time that a project reaches technological feasibility until the time that the products derived from the project are released for sale 
software purchased from third parties and included in our products is also capitalized  if technological feasibility for the project has been reached at the time of purchase 
these capitalized costs are then amortized ratably over the useful life of the products  generally estimated to be two to three years 
the amortization of capitalized software costs has declined over the last two years 
this decline is largely due to the software purchased from third parties and used in earlier versions of our current product lines  becoming fully amortized during and early cost of net service revenues cost of service consists primarily of personnel costs related to product license maintenance  training and technical support 
the table below presents these costs for the years ended december   and in millions total cost of service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues the decrease in the actual cost of service revenue as well as a decrease in the percentage of the cost of service revenues to service revenues is primarily due to a decrease in headcount in each of the respective years 
in august  we completed an operational restructuring which included outsourcing certain support functions 
the outsourcing activities enabled a lower infrastructural cost of service while maintaining adequate levels of support 
in  following a further review of the support functions  we were able to bring the functions previously outsourced back in house with a reduced staff 
we still lowered the cost of service but maintained the same or improved levels of support to our customers 
amortization of acquired products the amortization expense associated with acquired technology of raima corporation was million 
in  as part of the merger with raima corporation we capitalized million of acquired technology 
this intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated period of benefit of years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of raima corporation in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries  sales commissions and costs of advertising and marketing campaigns 
the table below presents these costs for the years ended december   and in millions total sales and marketing expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues sales and marketing expenses in increased million  or compared with and decreased million  or in compared with the increase in the sales and marketing expense is primarily due to increased staffing as a result of the acquisition of raima and one time severance costs of million  associated with a reorganization of the european sales and marketing organization in the third quarter of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was primarily due to reductions in staffing  including the elimination of portions of the field sales organization which focussed on the foresite product which we discontinued in the fourth quarter of engineering and product development the table below presents engineering and product development expenses  capitalized internal software development costs  and net engineering and product development expenses in dollar amounts and as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and in millions gross engineering and product development expenses capitalized software development costs net engineering and product development expenses as a percentage of net revenues gross engineering and product development expenses net engineering and product development expenses net engineering and product development expenses in increased million  or compared with and decreased million  or in compared with the increase in gross expenses in compared with is principally due to increases in personnel as we expanded our efforts to leverage core technologies into next generation products  and to increased personnel related costs as a result of the additional workforce of raima acquired in the decrease in of gross engineering expenses compared with reflects a reduction in staffing and associated engineering costs as we reduced our emphasis on engineering work for the application development environment software  at that time 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  are essential to our continued success  and we intend to devote substantial resources to new product development 
to the extent that net revenues do not grow at the same rate  such increases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staffing and related expenses  rent and facilities expense  depreciation  and outside services 
the table below presents these costs for the years ended december   and in millions total general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues general and administrative expenses in increased by million  or compared with and decreased million  or in compared with the increase in compared with is primarily due to increased personnel related costs following the acquisition of raima and charges associated with fully staffing the european finance and legal departments 
the decrease in compared with is due primarily to staffing reductions in the first half of in addition  during the third quarter of  we began to sublease a portion of our office space  which resulted in a reduction of net rental expense in amortization of goodwill and workforce intangible the amortization expense associated with goodwill of raima corporation was million 
in  as part of the merger with raima corporation we capitalized million of goodwill  that is being amortized over its period of benefit of years  and million of workforce intangible that is being amortized over its period of benefit of years

acquisition expense on january   in an effort to expand our product offerings into areas that compliment our core products  technology and internet applications  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire infospinner  inc of richardson  texas 
this agreement was not approved by a majority of our stockholders  so the proposed merger was unable to proceed 
costs incurred through the date of the stockholder vote were immediately expensed 
restructuring expenses in we incurred million of charges related to our restructuring efforts following the termination of our non exclusive distribution agreement with infospinner 
these charges included the write off of prepaid distribution royalties in connection with this terminated agreement and severance costs 
offsetting these charges was a million reversal of existing restructuring reserves  originally recorded in there can be no assurance that we will not believe it appropriate to undertake other major restructuring efforts in the future or to what degree any of these efforts will result in improved operational performance  if at all 
other income expense  net other income expense  net is comprised of interest income  interest expense  valuation of warrants  and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions  which are presented in the table below for the years ended december   and in millions net interest expense imputed value of warrants issued foreign exchange loss total other expense our gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have fluctuated from period to period  primarily as a result of fluctuating values of the us dollar and instability in european and latin american currency markets 
our foreign currency loss of for both and was principally due to the decline in the value of certain european currencies 
the costs of currency hedging are reflected in the reported gains and losses of foreign currency transactions 
we anticipate that we will continue to hedge foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in nonetheless  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could result in losses from foreign currency transactions 
sales of our products are denominated both in local currencies of the respective geographic region and in us dollars  depending upon the economic stability of that region and locally accepted business practices 
any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies in these markets may negatively impact revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
this impact is two fold it may adversely impact our ability to contract for sales in us dollars because our products and services may become more expensive to purchase in us dollars for local customers doing business in the countries of the affected currencies 
the us dollar value of a sale denominated in a region s local currency decreases in proportion to relative increases in the value of the us dollar 
the non cash charge of million is associated with the issuance of warrants 
the warrants were valued by an independent appraiser  using a modified black scholes option pricing model 
you should read note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the issuance and valuation of these warrants 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the provision for income taxes relates primarily to foreign withholding taxes 
as of december  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income which expire through and million available to offset future state taxes  which expire through due to cumulative ownership changes at december  our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited to approximately million annually to offset future taxable income 
at december  and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the net deferred tax asset balance due to the existence of uncertainty of our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows in millions cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period net cash from operating activities decreased million in compared with this decrease is primarily due to operating losses incurred in  offset by a smaller reduction in accounts payable and a smaller increase in accounts receivable as compared with net cash from operating activities increased million in compared with this increase is principally due to improved operating results 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in compared with this is primarily attributed to lower levels of property and equipment purchases in compared with net cash used in investing activities in increased by million compared with although property and equipment purchases were lower in than in  maturities of investments in were higher than in  which more than offset the relative higher levels of property and equipment purchases in that year compared with net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared with this is principally due to increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock and net proceeds from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared with principally due to increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we believe that expected cash flows from operations and existing cash balances  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we may  however  choose to raise cash for operational or other needs sometime in the future 
if we need further financing  there can be no assurance that it will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any additional equity financing will result in dilution to our shareholders 
working capital in millions working capital including impact of deferred revenue working capital excluding impact of deferred revenue working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities increased million from december   primarily resulting from an increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock 
excluding the impact of deferred product and support revenue of million at december   our working capital position increased by million 
this deferred product and support revenue of reflects a delay in recognition of revenue in accordance with contractual agreements and requires minimal future monetary resources of centura 
our capital requirements may be affected by acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to our business strategy  which we consider from time to time 
we regularly evaluate such opportunities 
any such transaction  if consummated  may reduce our working capital or require the issuance of our common stock 
at december  we had approximately million in unsecured foreign currency contracts  denominated primarily in various european currencies  as part of a program to hedge the financial exposure arising from foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
equity transactions and debt financing in december  we completed a private placement of  shares of our cumulative convertible series a preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of million  after deducting associated expenses  including the imputed value of warrants issued to our placement agent 
you should also read note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this private placement 
in june  we acquired raima corporation  a vendor of cross platform embedded databases and data management tools 
we acquired raima for million consisting of million shares of our stock valued at million  million of cash payable to former raima shareholders as certain financial conditions were met at the time of acquisition  and acquisition costs of million

in february  computer associates  inc  and newport acquisition company  llp entered into a note purchase and sale agreement which we agreed to 
centura and newport acquisition company then entered into a note conversion agreement whereby a promissory note  plus accrued interest  in the amount of  payable to computer associates was acquired by newport acquisition company  and immediately converted into  shares of centura common stock 
in january  we entered into a million asset based loan facility with coast business credit 
this loan facility allows us to borrow up to million  collateralized by our accounts receivable  combined with a million capital equipment facility 
under the terms of the agreement the loan balance is restricted to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as discussed in
