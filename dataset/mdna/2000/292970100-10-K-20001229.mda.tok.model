item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company energysouth  inc energysouth is a holding company for a family of energy businesses 
energysouth and its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the company 
the company  primarily through mobile gas service corporation mobile gas  is engaged principally in the distribution of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers in southwest alabama 
other energysouth subsidiaries are engaged in providing gas pipeline transportation  gas storage  gas marketing and other energy related services 
the alabama public service commission apsc regulates the company s gas distribution and storage operations 
mobile gas rate tariffs for gas distribution allow a pass through to customers of the cost of gas supplies  certain taxes  and incremental costs associated with the replacement of cast iron mains 
these costs  therefore  have little impact on the company s earnings 
other costs  including a return on investment  are recovered through rates approved in traditional rate proceedings 
interstate gas storage contracts of bay gas storage company  ltd 
bay gas do not require apsc approval since the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which has jurisdiction over such contracts  allows them to have market based rates 
market based rates minimize regulatory involvement in the setting of rates for storage services and allow bay gas to respond to market conditions 
the ferc issued an order on april  granting authority to bay gas to provide transportation only services to interstate and intrastate shippers and approved rates for such service 
the company s distribution business is highly seasonal and temperature sensitive since residential and commercial customers use more gas during colder weather for space heating 
as a result  gas revenues  cost of gas and related taxes in any given period reflect  in addition to other factors  the impact of weather  through either increased or decreased sales volumes 
the company utilizes a temperature rate adjustment rider to mitigate the impact that unusually cold or warm weather has on operating margins by reducing the base rate portion of customers bills in colder than normal weather and increasing the base rate portion of customers bills in warmer than normal weather 
normal weather for the company s service territory is defined as the year average temperature as determined by the national weather service 
in the gas utility industry  heating degree days are the benchmark for measuring coldness and represent the number of degrees that the daily average temperature falls below degrees fahrenheit 
results of operations net income all earnings per share amounts referred to herein are computed on a diluted basis 
net income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the fiscal years ended september   and was  per share   per share and  per share  respectively 
beginning october  the company changed its accounting methods for unbilled gas revenues to be consistent with prevailing industry practice and for start up costs to comply with new accounting standards 
the cumulative effects of the respective accounting changes on prior years are reported as separate components of net income in these accounting changes are discussed in detail within note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming retroactive application of such accounting changes  earnings per share amounts for fiscal and would have been and  respectively 
increased revenues from natural gas storage and transportation operations at bay gas produced the largest positive impact on earnings in fiscal increased utility margins gas revenues less cost of gas and decreased interest expense also contributed to the growth of earnings 
increased operations and maintenance expenses partially offset the positive impacts to earnings 
the increase in pro forma earnings in compared to was due primarily to increased revenues from bay gas  decreased operations expense and decreased interest expense 
operating revenues gas revenues increased  in compared to gas sales revenues from residential and small commercial customers  referred to as temperature sensitive customers since their gas usage is affected to a large degree by temperatures during the heating season  increased  in due primarily to higher purchased gas costs passed through to customers and increased volumes sold of resulting primarily from temperatures as measured by heating degree days in mobile gas service area that were colder than gas sales from large commercial and industrial customers increased  in compared to due primarily to increased pass through of gas costs and increased volumes sold to industrial interruptible customers 
one such customer used significantly more gas during the last six months of fiscal as a backup to its normal fuel supply 
several new industrial customers also impacted the growth in industrial sales revenues in gas transportation revenues  excluding those of bay gas  increased  in compared to resulting from increased gas volumes transported to existing customers in addition to a new gas powered co generation facility that began using natural gas for steam production and testing of turbine generators during fiscal the facility is expected to be fully operational in december several industrial transportation customers have the ability to use fuels other than natural gas and their fuel selection depends on the economic and operational considerations of competing fuels 
natural gas wholesale prices have increased recently to levels far exceeding their year average due to increased demand for natural gas due to a strong economy  increased industrial usage  and increased use of natural gas to produce electricity 
because of the wholesale price increases  which have been passed on by mobile gas to its gas sales customers and are being incurred by transportation customers in their commodity purchases  the company expects a limited decrease in gas consumption by one industrial customer with an alternative fuel choice 
other factors expected to reduce gas transportation volumes are the recent announcements by international paper company of its plan to shut down its mobile operations by the end of calendar year and the announcement by corus group plc corus  formerly known as british steel that it will shut down its mobile plant for an indefinite period beginning late october based on minimum payment provisions of the contract with corus  the company does not expect a material financial statement impact resulting from the shut down of the corus mobile plant 
offsetting the declines in transportation requirements of some customers are additional demands from other customers 
for example  mobile gas entered into a contract in november to transport gas to a co generation facility being constructed in the mobile area that is expected to be operational in early the company does not expect the decreased gas consumption by some industrial customers to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
also  management expects the impact of decreased transportation volumes to be mitigated by the impact of increases in gas consumption by new gas fired electric generating facilities as discussed herein 
bay gas storage and transportation revenues increased  in compared to primarily as a result of a full year of revenues from providing gas storage services for southern company s new gas fired electric generation facilities along the gulf coast 
bay gas began transporting gas to one such facility  alabama power s plant barry  beginning june under a long term transportation contract 
alabama power is currently constructing two additional gas powered generating units at plant barry  expected to be in service in the summer of  to which bay gas has contracted to transport gas 
the construction of natural gas fired electric generation facilities in the southeast and specifically in the mobile area has provided new opportunities for energysouth companies to provide gas storage and transportation 
the company expects this trend to continue since all new electric generation facilities reported to be planned for the southeast are to be natural gas fired 
in august  bay gas entered into a long term natural gas storage contract with southern company services  inc  an affiliate of southern company  as agent for certain southern company subsidiaries 
the new storage capacity in excess of southern company s current contract capacity will be provided primarily from bay gas second underground storage cavern that is in the initial stages of construction 
in addition  bay gas plans to construct two new pipelines to expand and or extend its existing pipeline 
a new mile pipeline expansion  which will parallel the northern part of the existing mile bay gas pipeline  will be constructed to ensure deliverability to the current level of transportation business 
also  in october  bay gas entered into a long term transportation agreement with koch gateway pipeline company  inc to provide firm transportation service through a new mile extension of the existing bay gas system 
a more detailed discussion of these construction projects is included under liquidity and capital resources below 
gas revenues decreased  in compared to included within gas revenues for was the effect of accruing for unbilled gas revenues at month end while no such accrual was included within since this new accounting method was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal the effect on gas revenues of the accounting change assuming retroactive application would not have been materially different from amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
gas sales revenues to residential and commercial customers decreased  in compared to due primarily to decreased gas sales volumes of resulting from weather in mobile gas service area that was warmer than in the prior year and due to lower purchased gas costs passed through to customers 
large commercial and industrial gas sales revenues decreased  in compared to due primarily to warmer weather  reduced rates related to the pass through of gas costs  and several customers changing from sales to transportation agreements 
gas transportation revenues  excluding bay gas  remained flat in compared to revenues from natural gas storage and transportation operations at bay gas increased  in compared to due primarily to transporting gas to a new co generation facility at olin corporation s plant in mcintosh and to storing gas for southern company  both services having begun in fiscal gross margins on gas revenues  defined as gas revenues less related cost of gas  increased  in compared to increased gas margins were due primarily to increases in bay gas revenues  gas sales to industrial interruptible customers and large industrial transportation revenues as discussed previously 
margins from temperature sensitive customers were up slightly in due primarily to an increase in these customers usage per heating degree day 
the company uses its temperature adjustment rider to adjust margins on gas sales to residential and small commercial customers during the months of november through april when temperatures vary from normal 
temperatures during fiscal and were and  respectively  warmer than normal resulting in a recovery of margins from customers subject to the temperature adjustment rider 
despite the temperature adjustment rider  margins from residential and commercial customers in were slightly lower than thus contributing to total gross margins in compared to being lower by  or less than 
decreased gas sales to large commercial and industrial customers was the primary factor in reduced margins in partially offsetting the above impacts on margins was an increase in bay gas revenues 
merchandise sales revenues increased  in compared to due primarily to increased sales of natural gas generators  while merchandise sales revenues decreased  in compared to due to lower sales volume 
other operating revenues is comprised primarily of interest income from the financing of merchandise sales and installations that occur at the company and through trade programs 
also included within other operating revenues are revenues from appliance service work  engineering consulting  operations training  pipeline corrosion protection services and gas marketing services 
other operating revenues increased  in compared to due primarily to revenues generated by a recently created division within energysouth services  inc that performs pipeline corrosion protection services 
interest income from merchandise financing programs also increased in other operating revenues increased slightly in due primarily to increased gas marketing revenues 
operating expenses cost of gas increased  in compared to due to an increase in gas sales volumes and to increased pass through of gas costs resulting from higher purchased gas prices 
the company passes the actual cost of gas on to customers under the purchased gas adjustment provision of rate tariffs 
because cost of gas is recovered from the company s customers  fluctuations in the cost of gas generally have no effect on gas margins 
cost of gas decreased  in compared to due to decreased sales volumes of and decreased pass through of gas costs resulting from lower purchased gas prices 
cost of merchandise in and changed in proportion to the change in merchandise sales revenues 
operations and maintenance expenses increased  in compared to primarily due to increases in bay gas operations and maintenance expenses  sales related expenses  expense related to providing future health benefits to employees on long term disability  employee health and life insurance costs  planned utility maintenance  and operating costs impacted by inflation 
operations and maintenance expenses decreased  in compared to primarily due to decreased advertising and sales promotion expenses and a lower provision for uncollectible gas receivables 
increases in depreciation expense in and were due to increased depreciable plant in service 
taxes  other than income taxes other taxes  primarily consist of property taxes and business license taxes that are based on gross revenues and fluctuate accordingly 
the change in other taxes for and is due primarily to fluctuations in business license taxes associated with gas revenues 
other income and expenses interest expense decreased  in compared to due primarily to a reduction in long term debt 
also  the company redeemed early  of first mortgage bonds in october  and in doing so  related debt issuance costs  which were previously being amortized over the debt repayment period  were written off 
interest expense decreased  in compared to primarily as a result of decreased long term debt caused partly by the early redemption of first mortgage bonds 
allowance for borrowed funds used during construction represents the capitalization of interest costs to construction work in progress 
capitalized interest costs increased  in compared to due primarily to an increase in ongoing capital projects during fiscal in  capitalized interest costs decreased slightly compared to due to lower short term interest rates applied in the computations of capitalized interest 
interest income increased  in compared to due primarily to increased interest income on temporary investments  most of which is attributable to bay gas as a result of its improved financial position 
interest income decreased  in compared to interest income of  on income tax refunds was recorded in while there was no such miscellaneous interest income in increased interest income on temporary investments in compared to resulting from improved bay gas results and the implementation of improved cash management procedures partially offset the decrease resulting from the impact of the tax refunds received in minority interest reflects the minority partners share of pre tax earnings of the bay gas and southern gas transmission company partnerships  in which energysouth  inc subsidiaries hold controlling interests 
minority interest increased  in compared to due to increased pre tax earnings in for both partnerships 
income tax expense fluctuates with the changes in income before taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in  and was  and respectively 
the components of income tax expense are reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation impacts the prices the company must pay for labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
changes in purchased gas costs are passed through to customers in accordance with the purchased gas adjustment provision of the company s rate schedules 
increases in other utility costs must be recovered through timely filings for rate relief 
gas supply a primary goal of the company is to provide gas at the lowest possible cost while maintaining a reliable long term supply 
to accomplish this goal the company has diversified its gas supply by constructing and purchasing pipelines to access the vast gas reserves in its area  both offshore and onshore 
the company has also contracted with certain of these sources for firm supply 
future minimum payments under third party contracts for firm gas supply  which expire at various dates through the year  are as follows   and  a portion of firm supply requirements is met through the withdrawal of gas from the storage facility owned by bay gas 
mobile gas has a gas storage agreement with bay gas to receive storage services for an initial period of years  which began in september with the commencement of commercial operations of the storage facility 
the company s purchased gas adjustment provision in rate schedules filed with the apsc allows the recovery of demand and commodity costs of purchased gas from customers 
should the company s customer base decline due to deregulation or other reasons  resulting in costs related to firm gas supply in excess of requirements  the company believes it would be able to take one or more of the following actions as part of the regulatory decision allowing other suppliers to serve current customers  secure the right to allocate firm gas supply costs to the new company supplying gas  reduce some excess gas supply costs through a negotiated settlement with suppliers  and or pass through excess gas supply costs to existing customers through the purchased gas component of customers rates 
environmental the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  which have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain environmental issues 
liquidity and capital resources the company generally relies on cash generated from operations and on a temporary basis  short term borrowings  to meet working capital requirements and to finance normal capital expenditures 
the company issues debt and equity for longer term financing as needed 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in was due to changes in operating assets and liabilities which generally reflects the timing differences between years of cash receipts on trade receivables 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to an increase in net income  adjusted for non cash components and the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
financing activities used cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in october  the company redeemed early  of first mortgage bonds 
as of september   and  the company had borrowings on its revolving credit agreement of million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million for and  respectively  was related to the purchase of short term federal obligations for shares tax planning purposes 
these investments matured in early october of each year and the proceeds were used to repay the corresponding short term debt 
because of recent changes in the applicable tax code  no such purchases were made in cash used in investing activities reflects the capital intensive nature of the company s business 
during   and  the company used cash for construction of distribution and storage facilities  purchases of equipment and other general improvements of million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects fiscal capital expenditures by mobile gas to be approximately million 
these expenditures will be for normal construction activity  expansion of its distribution system into higher growth areas  pipeline and related equipment to serve a new gas fired electric generation facility  equipment purchases and other general improvements 
bay gas has entered into a contract to provide storage services to southern company services  inc as agent for certain southern company subsidiaries 
in order to provide the storage service under the terms of the contract  bay gas is constructing a second salt dome cavern and installing related equipment 
phase i of the development  which is expected to be completed by december  will provide sufficient working storage capacity so that bay gas can begin providing storage services under the contract noted above 
further expansion of the cavern in phase ii will provide additional working storage capacity and is intended to be accomplished by fiscal year without interruption of storage operations 
bay gas expects fiscal costs relating to the additional cavern and related equipment to be approximately million 
the total cost of both phases of cavern construction will be approximately million  including capitalized interest 
in order to accommodate new transportation customers  bay gas will also construct two new pipelines to expand and or extend its existing pipeline 
both pipelines are expected to be completed by june and will cost a total of approximately million  including capitalized interest 
the expansion of the storage facilities and the construction of the new pipelines will be funded through the issuance of long term debt and from cash generated by bay gas operations 
in conjunction with the expansion  bay gas expects to complete the sale of  of senior secured notes  to be guaranteed by energysouth  in december the proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used toward the construction of the new cavern  pipelines and related equipment  to refinance  of existing debt incurred to construct the first salt dome cavern  to repay a  note to mobile gas for the financing of base gas in the existing storage cavern  and to pay a make whole premium of approximately  related to the refinancing of the existing debt  which will be expensed as debt extinguishment costs 
funds for the company s short term cash needs are expected to come from cash provided by operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
at september  the company had  available for borrowing on its revolving credit agreement 
management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its expected cash needs in the foreseeable future
