this list of important factors is not exclusive 
the company or the bank does not undertake to update any forward looking statement  whether written or oral  that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the company or the bank 
the business of the bank consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using these funds to originate various types of loans primarily in eastern middlesex county  massachusetts  including mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  commercial loans secured by general business assets  commercial real estate loans secured by commercial property  and to invest in us government and federal agency and other securities 
to a lesser extent  the bank engages in various forms of consumer and home equity lending 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio and its cost of funds  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and on borrowings from the fhlb 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of other noninterest income and operating expenses 
other income consists primarily of service fees  loan servicing and other loan fees and gains on sales of securities 
operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits  occupancy related expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution s regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
business strategy the bank s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to financing home ownership  small business and consumer needs in its market area and providing quality service to its customers 
the bank has implemented this strategy by i monitoring the needs of customers and providing quality service  ii emphasizing consumer oriented banking by originating residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  and by offering various deposit accounts and other financial services and products  iii recently increasing its emphasis on commercial banking and lending by originating loans for small businesses and providing greater services in its commercial and commercial real estate loan department  iv maintaining high asset quality through conservative underwriting  and v producing stable earnings 
asset liability management a principal operating objective of the bank is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
since the bank s principal interest earning assets have longer terms to maturity than its primary source of funds  ie  deposit liabilities  increases in general interest rates will generally result in an increase in the bank s cost of funds before the yield on its asset portfolio adjusts upward 
the bank has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
the term interest rate sensitivity refers to those assets and liabilities which mature and reprice periodically in response to fluctuations in market rates and yields 
as noted above  one of the principal goals of the bank s asset liability program is to maintain and match the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of the asset and liability portfolios 
in order to properly manage interest rate risk  the bank s board of directors has established an asset liability management committee alco made up of members of management to monitor the difference between the bank s maturing and repricing assets and liabilities and to develop and implement strategies to decrease the negative gap between the two 
the primary responsibilities of the committee are to assess the bank s asset liability mix  recommend strategies to the board that will enhance income while managing the bank s vulnerability to changes in interest rates and report to the board the results of the strategies used 
since the early s  the bank has stressed the origination of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate home equity loans 
the bank regularly sells fixed rate loans with terms in excess of years 
since  the bank has also emphasized commercial loans with short term maturities or repricing intervals as well as commercial real estate mortgages with short term repricing intervals 
in addition  the bank has used borrowings from the fhlb to fund the maturity or repricing interval of certain commercial real estate mortgages 
at june   the bank s loan portfolio included million of adjustable rate one to four family mortgage loans  million of adjustable rate commercial real estate loans  million of adjustable rate or short term commercial loans  and million of adjustable rate home equity loans 
together  these loans represent of the bank s net loans at june  see business lending activities

operating results are also significantly affected by provisions for loan losses  other income and operating expenses 
each of these factors is significantly affected not only by the company s policies  but  to varying degrees  by general economic and competitive conditions and by policies of state and federal regulatory authorities

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposits  borrowings  repayment and prepayment of loans  sales and participations of loans  maturities of securities and interest bearing deposits  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the company uses its liquidity resources primarily to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund net deposit outflows  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
the company is required to maintain adequate levels of liquid assets 
this guideline  which may be varied depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the company has historically maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of regulatory requirements 
the company s liquidity ratio at june  was  using the short term assets to short term liabilities formula defined under the federal deposit insurance corporation s uniform bank performance reports 
a major portion of the company s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term us government and federal agency obligations  and corporate bonds 
the level of these assets is dependent upon the company s operating  investing  lending and financing activities during any given period 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of management 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  the company believes it could borrow additional funds from the fhlb 
at june   the company had borrowings of million from the fhlb 
at june   the company had million in outstanding commitments to originate loans 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million at june  based upon historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at june   the company and the bank exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements 
for further information regarding the company s and the bank s regulatory capital at june   see regulation federal banking regulations capital requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time because of inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended by sfas no 
and  are effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an entity may elect to designate a derivative as follows a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction  or a net investment in a foreign operation 
the statement generally provides for matching the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss on derivatives designated as hedging instruments with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
depending on the type of hedge  such recognition will be in either net income or other comprehensive income 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value will be recognized in net income in the period of change 
adoption of this statement by the company will require that changes in fair value of covered call options be recognized in net income 
currently  such changes are included as a component of stockholders equity 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies affecting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the alco is composed of members of management and the board of directors to monitor the difference between the company s maturing and repricing assets and liabilities and to develop and implement strategies to manage the possible change in the company s net interest margin resulting from changes in interest rates 
the primary responsibilities of the alco are to assess the company s asset liability mix  recommend strategies to the board that will enhance income while managing the company s vulnerability to changes in interest rates and report to the board the results of the strategies used 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby affecting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
during the year ended june   the company began using working with a consulting group to perform its interest rate risk simulation analysis 
alco utilizes the results of a simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling one year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to board and alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the company uses various other assumptions in its sensitivity analysis 
for securities  in the event of a call provision  if the interest rate is lower than the contractual rate  reinvestment is assumed at the lower rate 
for residential mortgage loans  the company uses the psa method to generate different prepayment assumptions 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans do not include any amortization or prepayment amounts 
for money market accounts  now accounts  and regular savings deposits  not all deposits within these categories are assumed to increase by the full extent of the interest rate shift based upon management s judgment as to deposit elasticity 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of june  estimated nii sensitivity rate change year one year two basis points basis points the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
in addition  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
