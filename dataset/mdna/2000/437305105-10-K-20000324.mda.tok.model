the average cost per pound of plastic resin dropped from to  however  much of the savings from the decline in resin prices were passed along to customers 
this was done to maintain shelf space in response to competitive pressures 
also contributing to the margin improvement was the introduction of higher margin products  primarily within the general storage category and the favorable impact generated from the elimination of under performing and low margin sku s across all of the company s product lines 
offsetting some of the margin improvement was a change in the company s product mix 
in general  product lines acquired as a result of the acquisitions had lower margins than the company s mix of products in this was particularly true of the products acquired in the tenex asset acquisition and ahp products 
capacity constraints forced the company to outsource production of the products acquired in the tenex asset acquisition at a higher cost as compared to in house manufacturing 
the ahp products have a lower margin due to excess manufacturing capacity and too much emphasis on deal pricing

interest expense 
interest expense in was million  as compared to million for the primary contributor to the increase over was the result of million of debt added related to the acquisitions

income taxes 
income tax expense increased from million in to million in before benefit from extraordinary charges 
income tax expense increased because of a change in the company s tax paying position 
in  the company was able to use net operating loss carryforwards and the elimination of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to eliminate the federal tax expense 
by the end of fiscal  the net operating losses had been fully utilized 
as such  the company was in a tax paying position in extraordinary charge  net of tax

capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  unchanged from a year ago 
the company s total debt increased from million a year ago to million at december  the increase in debt is attributable to several factors  including increased working capital  capital spending and the company s stock buyback program 
the company s working capital  excluding cash and short term debt  increased from million in to million at year end the increase was largely due to higher accounts receivable from customers 
customers slowed down payments in the fourth quarter to meet their own purposes 
the increase in receivables is not the result of collection issues 
capital spending of million in primarily consisted of million to expand existing facilities in chicago and mexico  million related to new computer systems including the cost of installation and million to support new product development 
the company s capital spending needs in are expected to be million 
capital projects expected for include molds to support new product development and sales growth  outfitting of the el paso facility and new injection molding machines to improve productivity 
as in the past  management will pursue alternative means of financing including leasing 
during  off balance sheet financing totaling million was obtained through operating leases of machinery and equipment 
the company has entered into a year lease for the el paso facility 
the lease includes a purchase option prior to the end of the lease term 
during  the company spent million to buy back  shares of its publicly issued stock 
the shares were purchased at an average price of per share 
management believes its existing financing facilities together with its cash flow from operations will provide sufficient capital to fund operations  make required debt repayments and meet anticipated capital spending needs

all significant systems were converted and or upgraded prior to december  total costs incurred related to the yk situation were approximately million 
the company will continue to monitor yk issues during the year 
contingency plans are in place to cover any issues that may arise at a later date 
management outlook and commentary in  management took many steps to ensure continued growth in earnings and shareholder value 
the most significant actions taken were the following completed the integration of the various brands the company had acquired over the past few years into one brand homz 
under this brand  the company presents one consistent appearance in its retail offerings 
with the decision to move to a one brand  one company philosophy  management quickly began the process of consolidating all operating functions and eliminating duplicative processes 
the result of the consolidation will be annual pre tax cash savings of over million 
the company broke ground on a new  square foot facility in el paso  texas 
this facility will manufacture both ironing board and storage products as well as provide a launching point for improved western distribution 
the facility opened for production and distribution in march with the consolidation of the retail product lines under the homz brand  management took the opportunity to eliminate over stock keeping units sku s 
most of the products eliminated were duplicative or in unpopular colors 
while this step will result in the elimination of about of the company s sales  it will provide opportunities for improved operating efficiencies and margin improvement 
higher margin new products will replace the eliminated sales 
a uniform computer platform was installed for the homz product lines and facilities resulting in the consolidation of three separate computer systems 
the company acquired molds and inventory from a storage products company  significantly expanding the company s product offering in general storage items 
new injection molding machines were added to the company s chicago facility 
this provided additional capacity and improved productivity through reduced cycle times and energy use 
during  the company executed its plans to balance production levels between manufacturing facilities 
the chicago facility was expanded to a operation from a day  shift operation 
additionally  the minnesota molding facility acquired in was better utilized by adding general storage and closet items to its existing kitchen storage production 
the company added over  square feet of warehousing for its storage product lines 
the additional warehousing is needed to accommodate the company s growing presence with the company s big retailers kmart  wal mart and target 
during  the company will concentrate on revenue growth from existing product lines 
the company will also continue to seek every opportunity to maintain its position as a low cost producer 
some of these plans  together with assorted factors that may influence the performance of the company in and beyond are as follows the company will aggressively seek sales growth from existing product lines the el paso facility provides an opportunity to expand distribution with customers in the western half of the united states 
previously  the company was hampered in its western distribution by the higher freight costs incurred to reach western customers from the company s eastern and midwestern facilities 
the proximity of the el paso facility will provide distribution improvements and sales opportunities for both existing and new customers 
the facility began production in march the introduction of the homz brand will provide sales growth opportunities 
several retailers have already committed to homz ad events that will provide increased sales as well as increased awareness of the brand 
a major retailer has announced its intention to consolidate its general storage vendor base from vendors to less than the company has been selected to participate in the smaller vendor base 
management expects this development will result in sales growth with the customer 
the opening of the el paso facility will not only enhance the company s sales growth  it should favorably impact margins 
this facility will have new  highly efficient manufacturing equipment which will result in lower production costs as compared to the company s other manufacturing locations 
in addition  el paso is a very favorable labor market that can provide needed manpower at a reasonable rate 
the company s primary raw materials are plastic resin  steel  fabric and corrugated packaging 
fluctuations in the cost of these materials can have a significant impact on reported results 
other than plastic resin see discussion below  management does not expect to see a significant change in the cost of these materials as compared to however the cost of these items is affected by many variables outside the control of the company and changes to the current perceived trends are possible 
plastic resin represents about of the company s cost of goods sold 
during  the cost of plastic resin increased significantly 
this occurred after a several year period of declining plastic resin costs during which selling prices also declined in response to competitive pressures 
in the last months of  resin returned to cost levels of years ago 
now that plastic resin costs have increased  the company s ability to pass along this increase to its customers is hampered by both the nature of the retail customer environment and other competitive factors 
as a result of the plastic resin cost increase and the inability to raise selling prices  management expects gross margins in the first half of to be below the gross margins achieved in the future cost of plastic resin is difficult to predict 
plastic resin costs are impacted by several factors outside the control of the company including supply and demand characteristics  oil prices and the overall health of the economy 
any of these factors could have a positive or negative impact on plastic resin costs 
management s decision to consolidate its operating functions will save money for the company 
operating expense reductions as compared to will be achieved in the first half of but will decline as the year proceeds 
operating expenses as a percent of sales are expected to be lower in than in the full utilization of computer systems installed in will provide opportunities for productivity and earnings improvements 
the new systems will allow management to better monitor product and customer profitability  manufacturing performance and customer service levels 
forecasting tools expected to be implemented in will provide for better visibility to customer trends and will enhance inventory management 
the company has financed previous acquisitions primarily with debt 
as a result  the company is highly leveraged with total debt representing about of the company s book capitalization  or a debt to capital ratio 
as a result  earnings could be materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the financial and operating covenants related to the debt agreements place some restrictions on the operations of the company 
during  the company was well within its financial and operating covenants and expects to operate safely within the covenants in hpi has been a successful consolidator within the housewares industry 
most of the company s growth since has come from its acquisition activity 
management had believed that the continued profitable growth of the company would provide momentum for an increasing stock price 
management s strategy was to use the higher stock price to raise additional capital  pay down debt and acquire additional businesses 
unfortunately  the market has not recognized the increased value of the company 
further  management does not believe it would be prudent to pursue additional acquisitions of a significant size financed solely with more debt 
accordingly  the board of directors has retained investment bankers to assist management in addressing its capital needs including ways to raise additional capital to fund further acquisitions
