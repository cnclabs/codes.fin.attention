liquidity and capital resources lithia s principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures and for working capital 
lithia has relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under its credit facilities and the proceeds from public equity offerings to finance its operations and expansion 
ford motor credit company  toyota motor credit corporation  chrysler financial corporation and general motors acceptance corporation have agreed to floor all of lithia s new vehicles for their respective brands with ford credit serving as the primary lender for all other brands 
there are no formal limits to these commitments for new vehicle wholesale financing 
ford credit has also extended a million revolving line of credit for used vehicles and a million acquisition line of credit to purchase dealerships of any brand 
these commitments have an expiration date of december   with interest due monthly 
lithia also has the option to convert the acquisition line into a five year term loan 
in addition  us bank na has extended a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles and a million line of credit for equipment purchases 
the lines with ford credit are cross collateralized and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
the other new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant dealerships 
the ford credit lines of credit contain financial covenants requiring lithia to maintain compliance with  among other things  specified ratios of i total debt to tangible base capital  ii total adjusted debt to tangible base capital  iii current ratio  iv fixed charge coverage  and v net cash

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  lithia s sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year largely due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year

the timing of acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter
