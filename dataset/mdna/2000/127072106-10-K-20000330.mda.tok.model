introduction cabot trust cabot trust owns and operates a diversified portfolio of bulk distribution  multitenant distribution and workspace light industrial  r d and similar facilities properties throughout the united states 
cabot trust was formed on october   but did not begin operations as a fully integrated real estate company until the completion of the formation transactions and offerings on february   the closing date of cabot trust s initial public offering 
cabot trust had no operations prior to february  at december   cabot trust owned industrial properties  of which properties were acquired in connection with the formation transactions described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements herein  of which properties were acquired during and of which properties were acquired during the year ended december  in addition  four properties from the development program were placed into service in and in the near term  cabot trust expects to moderate the pace of its acquisition program  compared to prior years  and cabot trust expects development projects will provide an increasing component of growth due to the higher potential returns on capital 
cabot partners cabot partners was the real estate advisory and management entity that was the sponsor and organizer of cabot trust 
its revenues consisted primarily of asset management and acquisition fees earned under advisory contracts with large institutional investors 
results of operations cabot trust since cabot trust was formed in october and did not begin operations until february   the results for the year ended december  represent activity for days approximately months only  and no comparison of results to prior periods is available 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december   totaled million or per share  compared to million or per share for the year ended december  the increase is the result of having a full year of operations in compared to days in and increased earnings from additional investments in real estate 
the increase in net income allocable to common shareholders is also due to the conversion of units to common shares discussed in note to the financial statements  which resulted in a decrease in the allocation of income to minority interest but has no effect on net income per share 
rental revenues were million  including tenant reimbursements of million  for the year ended december   compared to million  including tenant reimbursements of million  for the year ended december  total rental revenue of million and million was generated in and  respectively  by the properties owned as of february  as a result of the formation transactions and still owned at december  the baseline properties and total rental revenue of million and million in and  respectively  was generated by the properties acquired or developed after february  the remainder of total rental revenue relates to properties sold 
cabot trust s operating margin the ratio of total rental revenues minus property operating and property tax expenses to total rental revenues decreased slightly to approximately for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a change in the composition of leases  primarily as a result of acquisition of multitenant and workspace properties  to more leases where cabot lp pays property and operating expenses and is reimbursed by the tenants compared to leases where the tenant pays these expenses directly 
depreciation and amortization related to real estate investments totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase reflects the acquisition of approximately million of real estate assets in  as well as a full year of expense related to acquisitions  and days of operations in compared to days in general and administrative expense increased by million  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a full year of operations in and it also reflects an increase in personnel to manage the acquisition  development  asset management and financing activity  from the increase in the number of cabot trust s properties during the two year period 
as a percentage of rental revenues  general and administrative expense decreased to in from in interest expense of million for the year ended december  represents interest incurred on an additional million of secured debt incurred during  million of unsecured debt issued in may  and additional borrowings under cabot trust s acquisition facility  net of million of interest capitalized to development projects 
interest expense of million for  net of  of interest capitalized to development projects  was incurred for only days on average indebtedness of million for during cabot trust entered into an interest rate hedge transaction referred to as the treasury lock involving the future sale of million of treasury securities based on an interest rate of approximately for such securities in anticipation of a future debt issuance of at least million with a maturity of years 
at the march  contractual settlement date for this transaction  cabot trust paid million to its counter party in the transaction  reflecting the decrease in treasury security yields since the july commencement of the transaction 
because an offering of the size and maturity contemplated when the interest rate hedge transaction was executed was not completed by the time of  or shortly after  the march  settlement date of the transaction  cabot trust recorded a loss related to the settlement of the treasury lock of approximately million during the year ended december  during  cabot trust sold two properties  which resulted in a net gain of million 
on june   cabot lp sold a  square foot property located in massachusetts for a gross sales price of million  which resulted in a gain of million  and on august   cabot lp sold a  square foot property located in new jersey for a gross sales price of million  which resulted in a loss of  interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earned on cabot trust s invested cash balances and earnings of cabot advisors  decreased by  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cabot trust s share of earnings of cabot advisors for the year ended december  compared with minority interest expense represents net income allocable to holders of cabot lp units and its cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units 
at december   cabot trust owned of cabot lp and the minority common equity ownership interest was 
at december   the minority common equity ownership interest was 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  during the year ended december  a significant number of units were converted to common shares  resulting in a decrease in minority interest expense related to limited partner unitholders 
during  the average minority common equity ownership interest was  whereas in it was 
dividends accruable to preferred unitholders  which totaled million in  are also considered minority interest expense 
cabot partners year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues  primarily consisting of asset management fees and acquisition fees  increased by million for the year ended december   or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in average assets under management for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   which resulted in an  increase in asset management fees 
in addition  acquisition fees increased by  in as compared to  due to an increase in fee earning acquisitions of million 
general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended december   or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  compensation expense increases accounted for  or  of the increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher professional services fees 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for and was and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  for the year ended december   to  due to increased amortization of two advisory contracts terminated during capital resources and liquidity cabot trust intends to rely on cash provided by operations  unsecured and secured borrowings from institutional sources  and public debt as its primary sources of funding for acquisition  development  expansion and renovation of properties 
cabot trust may also consider preferred and common equity financing when such financing is available on attractive terms 
as a result of the completion of the offerings in february  cabot trust issued  common shares to the public and  common shares in a private placement 
all of the common shares were sold at a price of per share 
the proceeds from the offerings  net of offering costs  were million 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  cabot lp issued an aggregate of million of cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units in five separate transactions in the net proceeds from these transactions were million which was used to pay down outstanding balances under the acquisition facility 
these cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units are callable by cabot lp at par on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance 
in march  cabot lp established a million unsecured revolving line of credit the acquisition facility  with morgan guaranty trust company of new york as lead agent for a syndicate of banks 
the acquisition facility is used to fund property acquisitions  development activities  building expansions  tenant leasing costs and other general corporate purposes 
the acquisition facility contains certain restrictions and requirements such as total debt to assets  debt service coverage and unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratios  and other limitations 
cabot trust believes cash flow from operations not distributed to shareholders and unitholders will be sufficient to cover tenant improvements and other costs associated with renewal or replacement of current tenants as their leases expire and recurring non incremental revenue generating capital expenditures 
as of december   cabot lp had million of fixed rate debt secured by properties  million of unsecured borrowings under its acquisition facility  million of unsecured debt and a debt to total market capitalization ratio 
the debt to total market capitalization ratio is calculated based on cabot lp s total consolidated debt as a percentage of the sum of the market value of its outstanding partnership units  plus the liquidation value of cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units plus debt 
in the normal course of its operations  through february   cabot trust purchased approximately million of real estate assets in the current year and has committed to purchase million of additional real estate assets 
the completed real estate asset acquisitions were primarily funded through acquisition facility borrowings and million of assumed debt 
cabot lp entered into an interest rate cap arrangement relating to its libor based acquisition facility for a notional amount of million for the period october  through april  this arrangement is intended to limit the libor component of cabot lp s interest rate on an equivalent amount of borrowings to per annum 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   representing an increase of million 
this was the result of million of cash generated from operating activities and million provided by financing activities  reduced by million used in investing activities 
year during  cabot trust completed its program of determining whether its business operations would be affected by date sensitive calculation errors that might result from computers whose programs do not properly recognize the year commonly referred to as the year issue 
cabot trust has not to date experienced any effects on its results of operations or financial position from the year issue  nor have any of cabot trust s vendors communicated to cabot trust that they have experienced any such effects 
inflation substantially all of the leases of cabot trust s properties require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  either all real estate taxes and operating expenses or all increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of such leases provide for fixed or indexed increases based on the consumer price index or other measures in base rent 
management believes that inflationary increases in operating expenses will be offset  in part  by these expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to using equity capital and retained earnings  cabot trust finances its acquisition and development programs and its ongoing operating cash needs through the use of debt financing 
cabot trust uses short term revolving debt  primarily in the form of its acquisition facility  and long term secured and unsecured debt with original maturities of five years or more 
cabot trust attempts to manage its debt maturities to reduce its exposure to the refinancing risk that would arise from having significant maturities of principal at a time when debt capital may not be available or may be available only at unfavorable interest rates 
cabot trust is exposed to market risk in the form of the effects of changes in market interest rates on its existing and proposed debt financing 
its acquisition facility bears interest at a variable rate  libor plus  while the interest rates on proposed fixed rate unsecured and secured debt instruments will usually be based on treasury securities yields plus a market based spread 
cabot trust has entered into various forms of interest rate protection agreements with investment grade financial institutions from time to time for the purpose of managing a portion of its interest rate risk 
for variable rate libor based borrowings  these agreements include interest rate collar and interest rate cap agreements that are intended to limit cabot s effective cost on variable rate borrowings  either within an agreed range or below an agreed maximum level 
for proposed long term instruments  cabot trust has also entered into treasury lock transactions that are intended to set the treasury securities component of the interest cost in advance through agreements for the sale of treasury securities having notional amounts and maturities comparable to cabot trust s intended debt issuance 
cabot trust does not enter into interest rate protection agreements or any other form of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
as of december   cabot trust was a party to an interest rate cap agreement that was intended to limit its exposure to changes in libor through april  on million of borrowings on its acquisition facility 
under the agreement  cabot trust s counter party is required to pay an amount equal to interest on that notional principal amount of borrowings to the extent that the relevant libor exceeds 
as of december   cabot trust also had a treasury lock agreement in place for the purpose of setting the treasury securities component of the interest rate on an intended future issuance of fixed rate debt 
this agreement provided for the sale of million of year treasury securities at a yield of on march  cabot trust paid its counter party million upon the maturity of this agreement  reflecting the decrease in treasury yields and consequent increase in cost of the notional amount of treasury securities to be sold since the july commencement date of the transaction 
taking into account million of variable rate borrowings that cabot trust had outstanding under its acquisition facility at december   and the above described interest rate cap agreement that was in effect at that date  an instantaneous increase of basis points in libor at that date would  if libor remained at the increased levels thereafter  result in an estimated million reduction in cabot trust s net income in this estimate is provided for the purpose of illustrating the possible effects on cabot trust s results of operations of changing interest rates and cabot trust s interest rate protection agreements 
it does not take into account any other effects that changes in interest rates might have on cabot trust s operations  such as higher interest rates on new fixed rate borrowings  nor does it consider any additional interest rate protection agreements that cabot trust might enter into in reaction to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
while an increase in libor of basis points over a relatively short time period is possible  it is unlikely that interest rates would increase instantaneously or stay at the same rate for a sustained period as assumed for purposes of the illustration 
as of december   cabot trust also had million of fixed rate debt at stated rates ranging from to secured by certain properties and million of fixed rate unsecured debt at a stated rate of 
the current and future use of fixed rate debt is advantageous to cabot trust  as compared with variable rate debt  in times of rising interest rates 
however  in an environment of falling interest rates  fixed rate debt would place cabot trust at a disadvantage as compared with competitors having larger components of variable rate debt
