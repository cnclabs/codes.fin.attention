refer to table for a summary of loans outstanding and mix percentages 
ii inherent in lending is the risk of loss due to the failure of a borrower to repay amounts due 
to minimize this risk  over percent of the billion commercial loan portfolio outstanding at december  is secured 
centura  by preference  is a secured lender 
unsecured commercial loans are generally seasonal in nature to be repaid in one year or less and  like secured loans  are supported by current financial statements and cash flow analyses 
commercial loans secured by commercial real estate are supported by appraisals prepared by independent appraisers approved by the bank in accordance with regulatory guidelines and by current financial statements  cash flow analyses  and such other information deemed necessary by the bank to evaluate each proposed credit 
all loans of  or more require complete and thorough financial and nonfinancial analyses  including in depth credit memos and ratio analyses 
in some cases  borrowers are visited at their places of business and most collateral is inspected by a lending officer 
systematic independent credit reviews ensure proper monitoring of post closing compliance 
weaknesses in credit and non compliance with terms  conditions  and loan agreements are promptly reported to the credit review area and reviewed 
in connection with commercial lending activities  centura had million of standby letters of credit outstanding at december  these letters of credit are subject to the same credit approval and monitoring process as commercial loans 
consumer loans consist of equity lines  residential mortgages  installment loans  and other credit line loans 
combined  these loans increased million to billion at december  equity lines and other credit lines increased million while residential mortgage loans decreased million from the prior year 
the increase in equity lines and other credit lines was in response to sale campaigns held during to help assess borrower risk when extending credit on consumer loans  centura utilizes a standard credit scoring system 
all new lines opened under the sales campaign mentioned above were subject to centura s standard credit approval process 
credit is extended by the bank principally to customers in its market areas of north carolina  south carolina  and the hampton roads region of virginia 
although not a significant part of centura s lending activities  foreign credit is extended on a case by case basis and is subject to the same credit and approval process as other commercial loans including an assessment of country risk

loans and other assets which were not performing in accordance with their original terms and past due loans are discussed under the section asset quality and allowance for loan losses 
on average  loans were up million or percent over  averaging billion for average loans as a percent of average interest earning assets increased slightly to percent compared with percent for the prior year 
for the year ended december   loans generated additional taxable equivalent interest income  including fee income  of million  an increase of percent over the prior year 
without the taxable equivalent adjustment  interest income earned on loans increased million to million 
interest income earned on loans is dependent on interest rates  credit spreads  and product mix 
loans repricing in a lower rate environment throughout the first half of the year accompanied by tighter credit spreads contributed to a basis point decline in the average loan yield between and refer to table  net interest income analysis and volume rate variance taxable equivalent basis

the effective duration of the investment portfolio at december  was years compared with years at year end table summarizes the investment portfolio by contractual maturity date with original contractual lives that range from one day to years

the classification of securities as held to maturity htm or available for sale afs is determined at the time of purchase 
centura classifies most of its investment purchases as available for sale 
this is consistent with centura s investment philosophy of maintaining flexibility to manage the securities portfolio 
for those investments classified as htm  centura has the intent and ability to hold them until maturity 
at december  and  the amortized cost of the htm portfolio amounted to million and million  respectively  decreasing as a result of scheduled maturities within the portfolio

interest expense on deposits declined million to million for compared with million for as shown in table  net interest income analysis taxable equivalent basis  the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points to percent for the decline in deposit interest expense was driven primarily by the rate environment which favorably impacted interest expense by million offset million due to volume changes 
the lower rate environment during the first half of  changes in the portfolio mix as described above  and an emphasis on more efficient and competitive product pricing improved the cost of funds for deposits 
other funding sources management utilizes short term borrowed funds  consisting principally of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and master notes

ii asset quality and allowance for loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the primary types of interest earning assets for centura 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to centura  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and ongoing review of loan payment performance 
total nonperforming assets  including nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties  were million at december  compared with million at december  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
declines in the loans secured by real estate  commercial and industrial and other real estate owned categories of million  million and million  respectively  were primarily responsible for this improvement 
table  nonperforming assets and past due loans  discloses the components and balances of nonperforming assets over the past five years 
during the third quarter of  centura charged off million of loans outstanding to pluma  inc pluma  an eden  north carolina based manufacturer and distributor of fleece and jersey sportswear 
including this credit  year to date net charge offs were percent of average loans versus percent for gross charge offs were million for compared with million in the prior year 
recoveries were down  totaling million for had pluma remained a performing loan  net charge offs would have been approximately million or percent of average loans 
commercial and industrial net charge offs  experiencing the largest increase  rose million over  primarily a result of the million pluma charge off 
the remaining increase in net charge offs was spread across the remaining loan categories 
the allowance for loan and lease losses afll is the amount considered adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses in centura s loan portfolio existing at the balance sheet date 
the afll grew by million to total million at december   compared to million last year 
at december   centura s afll as a percentage of total outstanding loans was percent compared to percent at december  the amount provided for loan losses during totaled million as compared to million for for additional information with respect to the activity in the afll  see tables and  analysis of allowance for loan losses and allocation of allowance for loan losses  respectively 
the allocated portion of the allowance of million as of december  includes both a specific and general allocation 
the afll for the commercial loan portfolio is established considering several factors including current loan grades  historical loss rates  expected future cash flows  and the results of individual loan reviews and analyses 
the afll for consumer loans  mortgage loans  and leases is determined based on past due levels and historical and projected loss rates 
loss percentages assigned for each loan grade used to develop the general allowance are determined based on periodic evaluation of actual loss experience over a period of time and management s estimate of probable incurred losses as well as other factors that are known at the time when the appropriate level for the afll is assessed 
generally  all loans with outstanding balances of  or greater that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific allowance is required 
included in the afll is an unallocated amount that represents the result of analyzing less quantifiable factors such as economic trends and other risk factors that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
during  centura management adjusted the risk factors used for general allocation of the allowance among the respective loan categories 
the risk factors were revised primarily in consideration of the trend in historical charge off levels  enhanced loan underwriting procedures and an evaluation of current economic trends and market conditions 
a combination of the risk factor adjustments and growth in the loan portfolio accounted for the  and million increases in the allowance allocated to the commercial including financial and agricultural and consumer portfolios  respectively 
however  as a percentage of the afll  commercial and consumer allocations were relatively unchanged from the prior year at percent and percent  respectively  at december  compared with percent and percent  respectively  at december  approximately one half of centura s loan portfolio consists of real estate mortgage loans 
accordingly  the million decline in the afll allocated to these loans was primarily attributable to the adjustments in the risk factors 
the million decline in the afll allocated to leases is primarily the result of lower volumes due to centura s decreased emphasis on the auto leasing product line which had failed to meet target objectives 
the increase in the unallocated amount was influenced by the decline in the leasing portfolio  the impact of the instability within the tobacco and other agricultural industries  the continued assessment of the first coastal portfolio  and the effects of the flooding from hurricane floyd on the consumer portfolios 
calculation excludes mortgage loans held for sale 
ii loans past due ninety or more days were million at december   down million from the prior year 
accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when management has serious doubts that such interest will be collected in a reasonable period of time 
generally  open end credit lines that reach days or more past due and substantially all other loans that reach days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 
generally  all loans past due days are placed on nonaccrual status regardless of security 
recorded accrued interest is reversed or charged off 
a loan classified as nonaccrual is returned to accrual status when the obligation has been brought current  has performed in accordance with its contractual terms over an extended period of time  and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt 
in addition to nonperforming assets and past due loans  management has identified approximately million in loans that are currently performing in accordance with their contractual terms that management believes may become nonperforming during the remaining term of the loan 
management believes the afll to be adequate based upon its current judgment  evaluation  and analysis of the loan portfolio 
centura continuously monitors overall credit quality and manages its credit processes  including loans in past due and nonaccrual status 
the afll represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable incurred current losses in the loan portfolio 
however  there are additional risks of future losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the afll is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
the afll is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the afll and the size of the afll in comparison to peer banks identified by the regulatory agencies 
no assurances can be given that the ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of economic conditions and other factors then prevailing will not require significant future additions to the afll  thus adversely affecting the operating results of centura

noninterest income and expense noninterest income nii for totaled million compared to million for  an increase of million or percent 
as a percentage of total revenues  defined as the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  nii grew basis points to percent 
the increase in nii for was primarily driven by growth in income received from service charges on deposits  brokerage commissions  credit card related fees  and other noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of nii  increased million to million  with changes to the fee structure for checking account products and nsf fee increases in the beginning of accounting for the increase

including the merger related expenses  nie increased million or percent to million for  compared to nie of million 
personnel costs are the single largest component of nie and increased percent or million over normal salary growth in combination with higher fringe benefit costs were primarily responsible for this increase 
offsetting the rise in personnel costs was management s decision not to pay certain incentive based bonuses as a result of centura not achieving established targets 
occupancy expenses and equipment expenses increased million and decreased million  respectively  compared to fees for outsourced services  ie  the outsourcing of various functions such as items processing  property management  and call processing generated from centura s telephone banking center  all of which are heavily volume based  were up million for the year ended december  the increase is attributed to greater volumes associated with growth in the customer base and the integration of new customers gained through acquisitions and new locations 
as expected  the acquisitions contributed to an increase in intangibles amortization of million for total intangibles amortization of million for the year 
telephone expenses increased  over marketing expense  office supply costs and losses other than loans decreased  million   and million  respectively 
marketing expenses dropped as a result of decreased emphasis on marketing campaigns 
as discussed below in the year section  centura incurred additional expense related to year remediation efforts 
direct and indirect expenses for and  which are included throughout the various components of noninterest expense  were approximately million and million  respectively

equity and capital resources shareholders equity as of december  and was million and million  respectively  and represented percent and percent of year end assets  respectively 
the growth in shareholders equity has been a function of the retention of earnings  the issuance of common stock in connection with acquisitions and the exercise of stock options 
offsetting increases to shareholders equity are repurchases of common stock  which centura executes from time to time  unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities and dividends to shareholders 
for the year ended december   centura repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
centura s common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cbc

centura s capital ratios are greater than the minimums required by regulatory guidelines 
centura intends to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix 
at december   centura and the bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized 
as a result of its well capitalized status  the bank is assessed at the lowest fdic insurance premium rates available for financial institutions under each insurance fund 
the bank has deposits insured under both of the fdic s insurance funds  the bif and the saif 
centura s total capital and tier i capital were million and million  respectively at the end of note in the consolidated financial statements presents the capital ratios for centura and the bank for and as discussed in the liquidity section  capital securities are a component of tier i capital 
ii table capital ratios of centura total tier i tier i capital capital leverage minimum requirement or or or regulatory agencies have generally taken the position not to include net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investment securities in calculating tier capital 
liquidity centura s liquidity management objective is to meet maturing debt obligations  fund loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  and manage operations on a cost effective basis 
management believes that sufficient resources are available to meet centura s liquidity objective through its debt maturity structure  holdings of liquid assets  and access to the capital markets through a variety of funding vehicles 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that centura is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
investment securities are an important tool to centura s liquidity management objective 
securities classified as available for sale represent an accessible source of liquidity through either repurchase programs or liquidation 
the bank s traditional funding sources consist primarily of established federal funds lines with major banks  proceeds from matured investments  contracts to repurchase investment securities  principal repayments on loans  and core deposit growth 
at december   the bank had billion in total federal funds lines available 
in addition  the bank had the ability to borrow up to million from the fhlb  of which million was outstanding at year end the bank also has the ability to issue debt up to a maximum of billion under an offering by the bank to institutional investors of unsecured bank notes that have maturities that can range from days and beyond from the date of issue 
each bank note would be a direct  unconditional  and unsecured general obligation solely of the bank and would not be an obligation of or guaranteed by centura 
interest rate and maturity terms would be negotiated between the bank and the purchaser  within certain parameters set forth in an offering circular 
as of december   there were million of percent year subordinated bank notes outstanding 
there were no bank notes outstanding at year end in addition  centura also accepts eurodeposits  has a master note commercial paper facility  and offers brokered certificates of deposit 
finally  centura has the ability to draw from an unsecured line of credit of up to million 
at both december  and  million was outstanding under this line 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on centura s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations  which if implemented  would have a material effect on centura 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
centura s market risk primarily stems from interest rate risk  the potential economic loss due to future changes in interest rates  which is inherent in lending and deposit gathering activities 
centura s objective is to manage the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize interest rate risk and stabilize the net interest margin and the market value of equity while optimizing profit potential 
centura does not maintain a trading account nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the table below illustrates the scheduled maturity of selected on balance sheet financial instruments and their estimated fair values at december  for loans  investment securities  and long term debt obligations  principal cashflows are presented by expected maturity date including the weighted average interest rate by exposure category 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at year end 
prepayment assumptions are based on rates evolving along the implied forward yield curve at year end and reflect market conventional prepayment behavior 
for deposits without contractual maturities  including interest checking  savings  and money market accounts  cashflows are separated ii into core and non core components 
the non core cashflows are scheduled to mature in while the core cashflows are presented based on management s assessment of runoff 
centura utilizes off balance sheet derivative financial instruments as one means of managing its interest rate risk associated with on balance sheet financial instruments

mismatches in interest rate repricings of assets and liabilities arise from the interaction of customer business needs and centura s discretionary asset and liability management activities 
exposure to changes in the level and direction of interest rates is managed by adjusting the asset liability mix through the use of various interest rate risk management products  including derivative financial instruments 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate floor and cap arrangements  and interest rate futures and option contracts swaps  floors  caps  futures and options  respectively  are an integral part of centura s interest rate risk management activities 
centura has principally utilized interest rate swaps  floors and caps 
swaps are used to manage interest rate risk  reduce funding costs  and allow centura to utilize diversified funding sources 
floors are used to protect certain designated variable rate financial instruments from the downward effects of their repricing in the event of a decreasing rate environment 
caps are used to protect certain designated financial instruments from the negative repricing effects of an increasing rate environment 
options provide the right  but not obligation  to put or call securities back to a third party at an agreed upon price under the specific terms of each agreement

these simulations include calculating the impact of significant fluctuations in interest rates  both increases and decreases  on net interest income and the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities 
based on a basis point rate shock in either direction  this simulation as of december  shows centura s interest rate risk position to be relatively neutral net interest income would not vary by more than approximately percent and the estimated market value of equity would not vary by more than approximately percent 
centura seeks a reasonable balance between a satisfactorily high and stable return on average shareholders equity and a satisfactorily high and stable estimated market value of equity 
an interest rate gap analysis is shown in table as of december  gap analysis is generally based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities including management s assumptions relative to financial instruments subject to prepayment and indeterminate life deposits 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
at december   centura had a negative one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap of approximately million 
the interest rate gap analysis is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment

year as of the date of this report  centura has not experienced any material effects related to the year readiness problem 
although centura has not been informed of any material risks associated with the year problem from third parties  there can be no assurance that centura will not be impacted in the future 
centura will continuously monitor its business applications and maintain contact with its third party vendors and key business partners to resolve any year problems that may arise in the future 
monitoring and managing the year project resulted in additional nonrecurring expenditures 
direct costs included charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance  and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which were not enhanced 
in addition to the direct costs  indirect costs were also incurred 
these indirect costs consisted principally of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products  and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
the emerging issues task force provided guidance concerning the accounting for the costs related to year modification 
the costs of the modifications were treated as regular maintenance and repair and charged to expense as incurred 
these direct and indirect costs did not have a material effect on centura s results of operations 
including direct and indirect expenditures  centura expensed approximately million and million related to year compliance efforts during and  respectively

ii current accounting matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the statement addresses accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and that those instruments be measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability  exposure to variable cashflows of a forecasted transaction or exposure of foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivatives and its resulting designation
