market risk sensitivity the company uses financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  as well as interest rate swaps  to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately million 
this exposure is limited by the use of interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
the company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes  nor is it a party to any leveraged instrument 
if short term rates increase by one half percent or basis points  the company s interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease  by approximately million 
conversely  if short term rates decrease by one half percent or basis points  the company s interest expense would decrease  and income before taxes would increase  by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of interest rate swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in the company s capital structure

for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates
