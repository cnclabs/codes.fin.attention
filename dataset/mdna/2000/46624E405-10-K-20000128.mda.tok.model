in addition  this measure does not represent funds available for discretionary use 
it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to ability of the company to meet its future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the financial statements subsequent to october  reflect the company s emergence from chapter and were prepared utilizing the principles of fresh start reporting contained in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the implementation of fresh start accounting  the financial information for the period from october  to november  and the years ended october  and october  is not comparable to the financial information of prior periods 
the fiscal operating profit for apparel includes charges of approximately million for writedown of certain long lived assets including excess reorganization costs and approximately million for certain restructuring costs 
fiscal operating profit for apparel includes charges of approximately million for certain restructuring costs 
the pro forma financial information was prepared for comparison purposes and gives effect to the plan of reorganization as if the transactions had occurred on november  for fiscal 
the unaudited pro forma financial information was derived by adjusting the historical consolidated financial statements of the company for the effects of fresh start accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
such adjustments primarily relate to decreased depreciation expense resulting from revaluation of the company s fixed assets  decreased interest expense resulting from extinguishment of old debt securities in the reorganization  increased amortization resulting from reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and the elimination of reorganization items  and their related tax effects 
this pro forma information is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed to be indicative of the results of operations of the company had the transactions been consummated on the respective dates indicated and are not intended to be predictive of the results of operations of the company for any future period 
results of operations introduction the company has repositioned itself from one that was largely textile oriented to a diversified manufacturing and marketing company that is focused on a broad array of industrial applications 
this has been accomplished by successfully streamlining the ongoing apparel fabric business and exiting three other textile businesses  while intensifying its focus on the two businesses with growth potential  jps glass and jps elastomerics 
on march   the company sold its boger city manufacturing plant  thereby exiting the home fashions woven fabrics business 
the company closed its angle manufacturing facility in the third quarter and sold the remaining plant on september   thereby streamlining the apparel business 
on july   the company sold its stanley manufacturing plant  thereby exiting its yarn sales segment 
on august   the company sold its borden manufacturing plant  thereby exiting its cotton commercial products segment 
the yarn sales and cotton commercial products segments are reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
additionally  company wide cost reduction measures were implemented at the beginning of fiscal  which included the elimination of certain jobs at estimated annualized savings of approximately million 
the company changed its name to jps industries  inc and is now focusing solely on improving the performance and profitability of its remaining core businesses jps elastomerics  jps glass and jps apparel 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal consolidated operating income loss increased million from an operating loss of million in fiscal to an operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal and fiscal results include charges for loss on writedown of certain long lived assets and certain restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
excluding such charges for comparative purposes  operating profit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal jps elastomerics net sales in fiscal in the elastomerics segment  which includes single ply roofing and environmental membrane and extruded urethane products  decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales of roofing products decreased million in fiscal the domestic roofing market continues to be characterized by intense competition driven by aggressive entrants into this market 
the company has addressed this challenge by instituting aggressive pricing strategies  development of new products slated to be commercially available in  strengthening sales management in key territories  and taking strong actions to reduce operating costs 
sales of urethane products increased million in fiscal due to higher demand for certain of the company s extruded sheet products used in security glass and athletic footwear 
operating profit in fiscal for the elastomerics segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease resulted principally from decreased roofing products sales  mitigated to a large degree by increased sales and improved margins on urethane products  implementation of cost reduction measures  and improved inventory management 
jps glass net sales in the glass segment  which includes substrates constructed of synthetics and fiberglass for lamination  insulation and filtration applications  increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the electronics industry represents the largest customer base for the company s fiberglass products 
in fiscal  global consumer demand for electronic products did not meet expectations and  combined with other factors  including the weakness in asian economies  led to a slowdown in demand for certain fiberglass fabrics used in the manufacture of electrical circuit boards 
to counteract these factors  the company took a number of actions to broaden its customer base in electrical substrates and increased its market share in building products 
in fiscal  the company completed its capacity expansion and modernization program allowing the company to gain market share 
these actions led to improved sales in fiscal compared with fiscal the company has also taken strong actions to reduce costs  improve manufacturing productivity and improve the quality of its products and services 
operating profit in fiscal for the glass segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal resulting from continued pricing pressures involving electrical substrates and the impact of production curtailments to reduce inventories to targeted levels 
jps apparel net sales in the apparel segment  which include unfinished woven apparel fabrics primarily for women s wear  decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal apparel fabrics are produced primarily from yarns consisting chiefly of rayon  acetate and tencel r fibers 
market conditions for these apparel fabrics weakened significantly during fiscal high levels of apparel imports negatively impacted the demand for domestically produced fabrics 
in response to these conditions  the company streamlined its apparel business through the closure and sale of its angle manufacturing facility in order to better match apparel production capacity with market demand 
in addition  the company implemented significant cost reduction plans and focused on dramatically reducing inventory levels 
operating profit loss in fiscal for the apparel segment improved million from an operating loss of million in fiscal to an operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal and fiscal results included charges of approximately million and million  respectively  for writedown of certain long lived assets and restructuring charges 
excluding such charges for comparative purposes  operating loss was million in fiscal compared with operating profit of million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the lower sales volume  lower unit prices and the effects of production curtailment to reduce inventories to targeted levels 
the determination to close the angle facility  as discussed above  resulted in a charge in fiscal of approximately million related principally to a loss on impairment of the plant in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this plant closing was completed in the third quarter of fiscal accordingly  an additional charge of approximately million was recorded in fiscal related principally to employee severance costs 
the plant facility was sold in fiscal for approximately million 
other pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of january   as amended  between jps converter and industrial corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of jps  and belding hausman  incorporated  jps converter and industrial corp 
sold substantially all of the assets of its boger city plant which was engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of home fashion textiles 
this business accounted for sales of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the consideration for the sale consisted of approximately million cash 
the cash proceeds were used by the company to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and an equipment loan 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the results of operations for fiscal included a charge for writedowns of certain long lived assets of approximately million for the excess of the carrying value of the plant over its fair value and related reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
additionally  in fiscal and fiscal  the company implemented cost reduction measures which included  among other things  personnel reductions and the idling of certain manufacturing equipment 
the results of operations for fiscal and fiscal include restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense in fiscal is consistent with the fiscal amounts after giving effect to the repayment of the contingent notes in fiscal long term debt was reduced by approximately million in fiscal with most of this decrease occurring in the last half of the year 
the impact of this reduction was offset by higher weighted average interest rates 
in fiscal  the company implemented a plan to exit its cotton commercial products and yarn sales segments 
accordingly  a charge for loss on disposal of discontinued operations of approximately million was recorded in fiscal this charge consists primarily of the writedown of disposed plant assets to net realizable value  the writedown of related reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets  employee severance costs and other exit costs 
on july   the company completed the sale of its stanley plant  thereby exiting the yarn sales segment 
this business accounted for sales of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated july   between c i  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and belding hausman  incorporated  the consideration for the stanley sale consisted of approximately million in cash 
on august   the company completed the sale of its borden plant  thereby exiting its cotton commercial products segment 
this business accounted for sales of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated june   as amended  among jps  c i and chiquola fabrics  llc  the consideration for the borden sale consisted of approximately million cash and a million subordinated promissory note which was recorded at its estimated fair value 
the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and an equipment loan 
fiscal compared with fiscal pro forma the financial statements for the periods subsequent to the consummation of the plan of reorganization were prepared under the principles of fresh start reporting for companies emerging from a plan of reorganization and are not comparable to prior periods 
the company believes that the most meaningful comparisons to fiscal are made using the pro forma financial information for fiscal and therefore this discussion addresses such pro forma information 
consolidated net sales decreased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income loss decreased million from a pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal to an operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal results include charges for loss on writedown of certain long lived assets and certain restructuring charges which totaled approximately million 
excluding such charges for comparative purposes  operating profit in fiscal was million compared with pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal jps elastomerics net sales in the elastomerics segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net sales of roofing membrane increased million in fiscal although the domestic roofing market was characterized by intense competition and market consolidation as growth rates receded from the double digit levels of the mid s 
sales of urethane products decreased million in fiscal  as a result of the decline in demand for certain of the company s products used in the manufacture of athletic footwear 
the athletic footwear industry was depressed in fiscal as a result of shifting consumer preference in casual footwear 
sales of liner membrane decreased million in fiscal due to declining unit volume and unit selling prices 
operating profit in fiscal for the elastomerics segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to pricing pressures in the domestic roofing segment and the overall decline in sales volume 
jps glass net sales in the glass segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal global consumer demand for electronic products did not meet expectations and  combined with the weakness in asian economies  created a slowdown in the demand for certain fiberglass products used in the manufacture of circuit boards 
operating profit in fiscal for the glass segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is directly attributable to the decline in unit sales volume and lower unit prices 
jps apparel net sales of apparel fabrics decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal market conditions for apparel fabrics constructed primarily of filament yarn weakened during fiscal producing unit volumes and average reduced selling prices well below prior year levels 
apparel imports and shifting consumer preference in women s apparel reduced demand for domestically produced imported polyester fabrics for acetate rich fabrics 
sales of fabric constructed primarily of spun yarns exceeded expectations for fiscal increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating profit loss in fiscal for the apparel fabrics group decreased million from pro forma operating profit of million in fiscal to operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal included charges of approximately million for certain restructuring costs and writedown of certain long lived assets 
excluding the effects of such charges  operating profit decreased million principally due to the lower sales volume  lower unit prices and the effects of production curtailment to manage inventory levels 
see the discussion under the caption fiscal compared with fiscal for an explanation of the charges in fiscal related to the closing of the angle facility  the sale of the company s boger city facility and certain restructuring charges 
other reorganization related fees and expenses incurred in fiscal totaled million 
such fees and expenses  which represent fees and expenses of the company s financial advisor  legal counsel and other professionals associated with the company s financial restructuring and the financial advisor and legal counsel for the holders of a substantial majority of the company s old outstanding bonds  have been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial statements 
no such expenses were incurred in fiscal because of gulistan s recurring losses during fiscal  the company sold its debt and equity securities of gulistan holdings  consisting of a million promissory note due in november  million of preferred stocks redeemable in november  and warrants to purchase up to of the common stock of gulistan holdings 
proceeds from the sale were million 
the writedown of the carrying value of the gulistan securities to million was reported in the period from november  to october  such writedown  which totaled million in fiscal  has been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial statements 
as a result of the application of fresh start accounting as required by statement of position sop of the american institute of certified public accountants  entitled financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million and reorganization items of approximately million were recorded as of the effective date 
the reorganization items include professional fees and expenses of approximately million discussed above and fair value adjustments of approximately million 
these items have been excluded from the fiscal pro forma financial information 
interest income and expense in fiscal are consistent with the pro forma fiscal amounts 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity for operations and expansion are funds generated internally and borrowings under its revolving credit facility as defined below 
on october   jps elastomerics and c i the borrowing subsidiaries and jps entered into the credit facility agreement the credit agreement  by and among the financial institutions party thereto  citibank  as agent  and bank of america  as co agent 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit loan facility and letters of credit the revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount equal to the lesser of a million and b a specified borrowing base the borrowing base  which is based upon eligible receivables  eligible inventory  and a specified dollar amount currently  subject to reduction based on fixed assets of the borrowing subsidiaries  except that i no borrowing subsidiary may borrow an amount greater than the borrowing base attributable to it less any reserves as specified in the credit agreement and ii letters of credit may not exceed million in the aggregate 
the credit agreement contains restrictions on investments  acquisitions and dividends unless  among other things  the company satisfies a specified pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio and maintains a specified minimum availability under the revolving credit facility for a stated period of time  and no default exists under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also restricts  among other things  indebtedness  liens  affiliate transactions  operating leases  fundamental changes  and asset sales other than the sale of up to million of fixed assets  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is october  subsequent to october   the credit agreement has been amended to  among other things i modify the financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures  ii modify the interest rate margin and unused commitment fees  and iii provide additional reduction of the fixed asset portion of the borrowing base 
as of october   the company was in compliance with these restrictions and all financial covenants  as amended 
all loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility  as amended  bear interest at either the eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement or the base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin the applicable margin based upon the company s fixed charge coverage ratio which margin will not exceed for eurodollar rate borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
the weighted average interest rate at october  is approximately 
the company pays a fee of 
per annum and a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate borrowings 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are made or repaid on a daily basis in amounts equal to the net cash requirements or proceeds for that business day 
as of october   unused and outstanding letters of credit totaled  the outstanding letters of credit reduce the funds available under the revolving credit facility 
at october   the company had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to lower operational activity resulting from the disposal of certain businesses in fiscal working capital at october  was approximately million compared with million at october  the fiscal amounts included certain assets held for sale 
in addition  fiscal reflects substantial decreases in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from lower operating activity and a focused effort on reducing inventory levels 
accounts receivable decreased by approximately million at october  compared with october  due principally to a decrease in sales in fiscal and the timing of customer receipts 
inventories decreased by approximately million in fiscal as a result of the internal efforts to reduce inventory levels 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal principally due to lower operating activity in the later part of the year 
the principal non operating uses of cash in fiscal were for property  plant and equipment expenditures of million for upgrade of the company s manufacturing operations and the repayment of long term debt of approximately million 
during fiscal  the company received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of its boger city  stanley  borden and angle facilities as discussed under the caption fiscal compared with fiscal such funds were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and certain equipment loans 
as of october   the company had commitments of million for capital expenditures 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately million and expects such amounts to be funded by cash from operations  bank and other equipment financing sources 
on august   the company reduced its long term debt and related investments by repaying all of the approximately million in principal amount of jps capital s contingent notes 
in fiscal  the company entered into a seven year lease agreement classified as capital lease for certain machinery and equipment 
the total cost of the assets to be covered by the lease is limited to approximately million 
the total cost of assets under lease at october  was approximately million 
the lease provides for an early buyout option at the end of six years and includes purchase and renewal options at fair market value at the end of the lease term 
based upon the company s ability to generate working capital through its operations and its revolving credit facility  the company believes that it has the financial resources necessary to pay its capital obligations and implement its business plan for at least fiscal inflation and tax matters the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
it has generally been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs by increasing the prices for its products  however  market conditions sometimes preclude this practice 
for fiscal  the company recorded a tax expense of million even though the company had losses from continuing operations 
the expense resulted from the impact of non deductible items  principally the amortization of excess reorganization value and from state income taxes arising in jurisdictions where separate returns are filed 
as a result of valuation allowances  no benefit was recorded on the loss from discontinued operations 
the company had approximately million of regular federal net operating loss carryforwards as of october  as described below  a portion of these losses are subject to limitations on usage as a result of the ownership change that occurred under the plan of reorganization 
additional limitations could occur should the company undergo another ownership change  as determined under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
for the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded a tax expense of million 
a tax expense was recorded even though the company had current year losses 
this expense was due to the nondeductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes and the recording of an additional valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
the nondeductible items consist primarily of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
the additional valuation allowance was provided based on management s assessment of the ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for the period from october  to november   the company recorded a tax expense of million 
the tax expense for the period ending november  includes the utilization of a portion of the deferred tax asset  which was recorded as of the effective date of the plan of reorganization of the company 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory federal income tax rate due to the impact of items not deductible for federal income tax purposes and because of state income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit for the period ending october  of approximately million 
this consists of a benefit from the implementation of the plan of reorganization  net of state taxes on subsidiary operations that could not be offset by operating loss carryovers or current year losses of jps or its subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the code provides that there are no taxes payable on gains such as the extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt that was realized on the reorganization of the company in the period from november  to october  however  the company was required under provisions of the code to reduce certain net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes as a result of such gain 
beginning net operating loss carryovers were reduced by approximately million 
in addition  alternative minimum tax credit carryovers were reduced by approximately million 
as a result of valuation allowances on these assets  there was no tax expense attributable to such reductions 
in addition to attribute reduction  any remaining net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to the limitations imposed by section of the code 
the effect of these limitations was to limit the utilization of the approximately million of the current net operating loss carryovers and certain other attributes to an annual amount of approximately million subject to certain adjustments 
year compliance description of year issue as a result of the existence of computer programs and chips embedded in process control equipment that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  a concern commonly known as year has arisen globally 
computer programs and equipment having time sensitive software or imbedded processors may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  such as production shutdowns  or a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
mission critical applications which could be impacted include purchasing and inventory management  production control  general ledger accounting  billing  payroll  and disbursements 
the company s plan in fiscal  the company conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the year issue 
since that date  the company developed  implemented and completed its plan to address the year issue 
task teams led by senior executives identified six project phases including i inventory of systems and process exposure  ii risk assessment and prioritization  iii remediation of non compliant systems  iv testing and development of compliant systems  v maintenance once compliance is achieved  and vi contingency planning 
remediation involved repair of existing systems and equipment and  in some cases  complete replacement with purchased systems and equipment that are year compliant 
replaced and modified systems have been subjected to rigorous testing in a non production environment in parallel with production data and  once deployed  are continually monitored for compliance 
activities to maintain such compliance included monitoring of reprogrammed systems once back in production  internal and third party audits of critical systems  vendor compliance certifications  and testing of contingency plans 
management also reviewed production equipment used in its operations and performed a written survey of its critical equipment vendors in an attempt to certify that the systems imbedded in sophisticated production equipment are year compliant 
in addition  all new equipment purchases were  and continue to be  screened for year compliance 
contingency plans were developed  tested and implemented as necessary over the year end cutover 
the contingency plans addressed i the development of a contingency planning framework  including common approaches and criteria  ii clear assignment of accountability for executing the contingency planning framework  iii monitoring of results  and iv testing and validation 
the company corresponded and met with critical vendors and service providers to discern their year compliance status and testing procedures 
most of these vendors and service providers supply raw materials and equipment to the company 
all responses were received and followed up as necessary 
the company has completed all of the aforementioned phases for all critical it and process systems  and  as of this date  there have been no failures of it or process systems causing significant disruptions of company business 
further  we are aware of no third party failures that have significantly impacted company systems or processes 
it is possible  however  that additional problems may manifest themselves in the next several months  particularly any related to the february th leap year day 
to preserve compliance of remediated and tested systems  testing of it and process systems will continue through march costs associated with year compliance the incremental cost of addressing the year issue has been substantially absorbed in the normal budget for improvement in management information systems and by normal costs for administrative and technical employees 
the company  however  retains contract programmers to work on discrete projects and will continue this practice into the foreseeable future 
the incremental cost of addressing the year issue is estimated at  substantially all of which has been spent as of december  most of these expenditures have been for remediation or replacement of existing systems 
at this time  management believes that the final cost of year modifications will not materially exceed this amount 
there can be no assurances  however  that these estimates will not change 
specific factors that could cause material cost increases include  but are not limited to  additional problems that may surface in the next year and any remaining impacts from problems with systems and processes of third parties  of which we are currently unaware 
risks presented by year issues there can be no assurance given that any or all of the company s systems are or will continue to be year compliant 
despite its best efforts  a failure by the company to have resolved a material year issue could result in an interruption in  or failure of  normal business operations and could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
in addition  due to the uncertainties inherent in the year problem  the company cannot insure that its most important vendors  customers and service providers will continue to be year compliant 
the failure of critical third parties to correct all year problems could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition  even resulting in an interruption in normal business operations 
however  as a result of the activities described above  and our experience to date  management believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer or process systems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company in fiscal management of the company has not yet evaluated the effects of this statement on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company has exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to interest rate changes under its revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility bears interest at rates which vary with changes in i the london interbank offered rate libor or ii a rate of interest announced publicly by citibank in new york  new york 
the company does not speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
as of october   approximately million of the company s debt bore interest at variable rates 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows would not be significant 
raw material price risk 
a portion of the company s raw materials are staple goods that are affected by raw material pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties  and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
in most cases  essential raw materials are available from several sources 
for several raw materials  however  branded goods or other circumstances may prevent such diversification and an interruption of the supply of these raw materials could have a significant impact on the company s ability to produce certain products 
the company has established long term relationships with key suppliers and may enter into purchase contracts or commitments of one year or less for certain raw materials 
such agreements generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the contract or commitment 
the company believes that any changes in raw material pricing  which cannot be adjusted for by changes in its product pricing or other strategies  would not be significant
