we have entered into a definitive agreement with keeneland association  inc keeneland whereby keeneland will purchase the assets of khc for a cash payment of million 
the sale is subject to certain closing conditions  and closing is expected during march or april of churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations additionally  we are the majority owner and operator of hoosier park at anderson in anderson  indiana  which conducts thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing hoosier park 
hoosier park is owned by hoosier park  lp hplp  an indiana limited partnership

upon closing  we will retain a interest in hoosier park and continue to manage its day to day operations 
centaur  which already owned a portion of hplp prior to the agreement  will hold a minority interest in hplp 
the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions  including the approval of the indiana horse racing commission ihrc and various regulatory agencies and closing is expected during the second quarter of we also conduct simulcast wagering on horse racing at our off track betting facilities otbs located in louisville  kentucky  and in indianapolis  merrillville and fort wayne  indiana  as well as at our racetracks 
because of the seasonal nature of our business  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are likely not indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year and are not necessarily comparable with results for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we normally earn a substantial portion of our net earnings in the second quarter of each year during which the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks are run 
the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks are run on the first weekend in may 
our primary source of revenue is commissions on pari mutuel wagering at our racetracks and otbs 
other sources of revenue include indiana riverboat admissions subsidy revenue  simulcast fees  lease income  admissions and concessions revenue 
the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks  both held at churchill downs  continue to be our premier racing events 
the kentucky derby offers a minimum million in purse money and the kentucky oaks offers a minimum million in purse money 
calder race course is home to the festival of the sun  florida s richest day in thoroughbred racing offering approximately million in total purse money 
hollywood park is home to the sempra energy hollywood gold cup  which offers million in purse money 
hollywood park s autumn meet is highlighted by the annual million autumn turf festival  comprised of six graded stakes races 
other races that make us unique are the indiana derby for thoroughbreds and the dan patch invitational for standardbreds held at hoosier park  as well as the gardenia stakes for older fillies and mares held at ellis park 
churchill downs hosted the breeders cup championship breeders cup in   and  and will host the event for a record fifth time on november  hollywood park has also hosted the breeders cup in  and the breeders cup is sponsored by breeders cup limited  a tax exempt organization chartered to promote thoroughbred racing and breeding 
the breeders cup races  which feature million in purses  are held annually for the purpose of determining thoroughbred champions in eight different events 
racetracks across north churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations america compete for the privilege of hosting the breeders cup races each year 
although most of the income earned from this event is allocated to breeders cup limited  hosting the event had a positive impact on our results  and hosting the event in is expected to have a positive impact on our results 
kentucky s racetracks  including churchill downs and ellis park  are subject to the licensing and regulation of the kentucky racing commission krc 
the krc consists of members appointed by the governor of kentucky 
licenses to conduct live thoroughbred race meets and to participate in simulcasting are approved annually by the krc based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in kentucky 
although to some extent churchill downs and ellis park compete with other racetracks in kentucky for the award of racing dates  the krc is required by state law to consider and seek to preserve each racetrack s usual and customary live racing dates 
generally  there is no substantial change from year to year in the racing dates awarded to each racetrack 
we received approval from the krc to conduct two live thoroughbred racing meets at churchill downs from april through july  spring meet  and from october through november  fall meet  for a total of days  excluding the breeders cup on november  churchill downs conducted live racing from april through june   and from october through november   for a total of racing days compared to a total of racing days in krc approved a one week increase in churchill downs spring meet during  which is a reduction to ellis park s customary racing schedule 
the krc also awarded ellis park approval to conduct live thoroughbred racing from july through september   for a total of live racing days 
ellis park conducted live racing from june through september   for a total of racing days compared to racing days in the decrease of live race dates for compared to is the result of reducing the live racing week from days of live racing to days of live racing and the movement of one week of live racing to churchill downs spring meet 
we expect the change in live race dates to better utilize the operations of both racetracks 
in california  licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcasting are approved by the california horse racing board annually based upon applications submitted by california racetracks 
generally  there is no substantial change from year to year in the racing dates awarded to each racetrack 
hollywood park  which was acquired on september   has been approved to conduct two live thoroughbred race meets from april through july  spring summer meet  and from november through december  autumn meet  for a total of days combined 
hollywood park conducted days of racing during compared to days of racing during churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis f financial condition and results of operations in florida  licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcasting are approved by the department of business and professional regulation  division of pari mutuel wagering dpw 
the dpw is responsible for overseeing the network of state offices located at every pari mutuel wagering facility  as well as issuing the permits necessary to operate a pari mutuel wagering facility 
the dpw also approves annual licenses for thoroughbred  standardbred and quarter horse races 
calder race course  inc and tropical park  inc  which were acquired april   hold licenses to conduct two consecutive live thoroughbred race meets at calder race course 
calder race course  inc has been approved for live racing from may through november   and tropical park  inc was approved from november  through january   for a collective total of days of live racing 
in  calder race course conducted days of racing  which included days of racing in january compared to days of racing during  which included days of racing in january during  day of approved live racing was lost as a result of inclement weather 
tax laws in florida currently discourage the three miami area racetracks in florida from applying for licenses for race dates outside of their traditional racing season  which currently do not overlap 
effective july   a new tax structure will eliminate this deterrent 
accordingly  calder race course may face direct competition from other florida racetracks and may have the ability to increase live racing dates or lose live racing dates in the future 
in indiana  licenses to conduct live standardbred and thoroughbred race meets  including quarter horse races  and to participate in simulcasting are approved annually by the indiana horse racing commission ihrc  which consists of five members appointed by the governor of indiana 
licenses are approved annually by the ihrc based upon applications submitted by hoosier park 
currently  hoosier park is the only facility in indiana licensed to conduct pari mutuel wagering on live standardbred  quarter horse or thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcasting 
the ihrc has approved hoosier park to conduct live standardbred racing from april through august   and live thoroughbred racing from september through december   for a combined total of live racing dates in hoosier park conducted live racing from april  through december   for a combined total of days of racing during compared to total days of racing during indiana law requires us to conduct live racing for at least days each year in order to simulcast races 
in december  the ihrc accepted an application from a group of investors who seek to build a standardbred racetrack in lawrence  indiana 
the application is now in the review process 
it is our belief that the indianapolis market cannot support two racetracks  and hoosier park is compiling market data to respond to the proposal 
the addition of a second racetrack in indiana could potentially impact hoosier park s share of the riverboat admissions revenue  create an increase in competition in the market and reduce the quality of racing 
a reduction in hoosier park s live racing dates as a result of a second race track could also result in an adverse impact on long term profitability of the facility 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the total number of days on which each racetrack conducts live racing fluctuates annually according to the calender year 
a substantial change in the allocation of live racing days at churchill downs  hollywood park  calder race course  hoosier park or ellis park could adversely impact our operations and earnings in future years 
as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees company wide 
due to the seasonal nature of our live racing business  the number of seasonal and part time persons employed will vary throughout the year 
during  peak employment occurred during kentucky derby week when we employed as many as  persons company wide 
during  average full time and seasonal employment per pay period was approximately individuals company wide 
we generally do not directly compete with other racetracks or otbs for local patrons due to geographic separation of facilities or differences in seasonal timing of meets 
calder race course  for example  is in close proximity to two other racetracks  but the tracks currently do not directly compete with each other because they offer live races and simulcasting during different times of the year 
however  we compete with other sports  entertainment and gaming options  including riverboat  cruise ship and land based casinos and lotteries  for patrons for both live racing and simulcasting 
we attempt to attract patrons by providing high quality racing products in attractive entertainment facilities with fairly priced  appealing concession services 
the development of riverboat gaming facilities began in indiana pursuant to authorizing legislation passed by the state of indiana in illinois had previously authorized riverboat gaming 
there are currently five riverboat casinos operating on the ohio river along kentucky s border  including two in the southeastern indiana cities of lawrenceburg and rising sun  one in southwestern indiana in evansville and one in metropolis  illinois 
the fifth riverboat casino  licensed to rdi caesars  opened in november in harrison county  indiana  miles from louisville 
we experienced some decreases in attendance and pari mutuel wagering at the churchill downs sports spectrum louisville sports spectrum during as compared to however  we experienced an increase in pari mutuel wagering on churchill downs races  including export simulcasting  during the same period 
it is impossible to accurately determine the extent of the riverboat s impact on our business at these facilities 
other factors  such as unfavorable weather conditions  may also have had an impact 
the indiana gaming commission voted in september to grant a license to open a fifth indiana riverboat along the ohio river in switzerland county  about miles from louisville 
the license holder  pinnacle entertainment  inc  formerly hollywood park  inc  plans to build a riverboat casino  hotel and resort complex  which is projected to open in the third quarter of churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to those riverboats operating along the ohio river  five riverboat casinos have opened along the indiana shore of lake michigan near our indiana sports spectrum in merrillville  indiana 
the opening of these lake michigan riverboats adversely impacted our pari mutuel wagering activities at the merrillville facility 
given its proximity to chicago  the merrillville indiana sports spectrum also faces competition from otbs and riverboat casinos near chicago 
we also compete with cruise ship casinos in florida and state lotteries 
additionally  several native american tribes in florida have expressed interest in opening casinos in southern florida  which could compete with calder race course 
also  the state of michigan has approved a proposal by the pokagon band of the potawatomi indian tribe to develop a casino in new buffalo  michigan  which is approximately miles from our merrillville facility 
the development of this casino may negatively impact pari mutuel activities at hoosier park s indiana facilities 
in kentucky  a breeders cup incentive bill is being considered by the kentucky general assembly 
this proposed legislation seeks to attract the breeders cup to kentucky more frequently by eliminating the excise tax on pari mutuel wagering for live races on breeders cup day at any kentucky racetrack hosting the event 
it remains uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted 
the potential integration of alternative gaming products at our racetrack facilities is one of our four core business strategies developed to position us to compete in this changing environment 
we have successfully grown our live racing product by implementing our other core business strategies by strengthening our flagship operations  increasing our share of the interstate simulcast market and geographically expanding our racing operations in kentucky  indiana  florida and california 
alternative gaming in the form of video lottery terminals may enable us to more effectively compete with indiana riverboat casinos and provide new revenue for purse money and capital investment 
we continue to seek industry consensus for a plan to allow video lottery terminals at our racetrack facilities in kentucky 
currently  we are working with members of the kentucky horse industry to establish a consensus for a plan to operate video lottery terminals exclusively at kentucky s racetracks 
the horse industry in indiana presently receives 
per admission to indiana riverboats to compensate for the effect of riverboat competition 
by ihrc rule we are required to allocate of such revenue directly for purse expenses  breed development and reimbursement of approved marketing costs 
the balance  or  is received by hoosier park as the only horse racetrack currently operating in indiana 
riverboat admissions revenue from our indiana churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations increased million for the year ended december  compared to  as a result of the expansion of existing riverboats 
the net increase in riverboat admissions revenue  after required purse and marketing expense increases of approximately million  is million 
in november  the company and the ihrc agreed to a million ceiling on hoosier park s share of the subsidy 
the ceiling represents a decrease from the million revenues hoosier park earned for a more significant change in hoosier park s share of the subsidy  as a result of a possible second track approved in indiana  would impact funding for operating expenditures  potentially reducing the number of race dates at hoosier park and  in all likelihood  re emphasize the need for the integration of alternative gaming products at the hoosier park racetrack in order for it to remian a profitable enterprise 
technological innovations have opened the distribution channels for live racing products to include in home wagering 
television games network tvg  a subsidiary of tv guide  inc  offers high quality live racing video signals in conjunction with its interactive television wagering system 
we have entered into agreements to broadcast our racetrack simulcast products as part of tvg s programming content 
this new network is anticipated to eventually offer hour a day programming throughout the united states that will be primarily devoted to developing new fans for racing 
in jurisdictions where lawful  in home patrons of tvg can wager on our live races as well as other race signals 
as the originator of the live racing signal  we will receive a simulcast fee on in home wagers placed on our races 
in june  the us justice department raised concerns whether interactive wagering conducted through tvg s wagering hub would be legal under existing federal gambling laws 
in addition  certain state attorney generals have expressed concern over the legality of tvg s business 
tvg related revenues are not material to our operations at this time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving loan facility which bears interest at libor based variable rates 
we are exposed to market risk on this variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in the libor rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on the revolving loan facility remains constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would reduce pre tax earnings and cash flows by million 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with our variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with a major financial institution 
under terms of the contracts we receive a libor based variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate of and on notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the million interest rate swap matured in march and the million interest rate swap matures in august at december   these interest rate swaps approximated a mark to market value of  based on current interest rates 
assuming the december  notional amounts under the interest rate swap contracts remain constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would increase pre tax earnings and cash flows by million 
upon expiration of the million interst rate swap in early march  we enterd into a year interest rate swap in which we pay a fixed interest rate of on a notional amount of million 
management plans to engage in further interest rate swap agreements in the future to protect our interest rate exposure
