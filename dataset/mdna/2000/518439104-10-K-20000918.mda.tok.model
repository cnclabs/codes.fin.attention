item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
the following is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
sales of products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category 
prior year information has been restated to include the results of operations related to those products and services

we achieved double digit growth in net sales of our makeup products  both domestically and abroad  on the strength of new and existing products  expanded distribution of mac products and the addition of stila 
improvements in sales of skin care products primarily relate to new products targeting diverse groups of consumers 
growth of hair care sales was fueled by new product introductions and changes in our lines of distribution 
before considering the effect of converting foreign currencies  total net sales grew  with double digit contributions from each region 
product categories skin care skin care product sales increased or million to  million  partially reflecting our ability to capitalize on the success of resilience lift by rolling it out internationally and our introduction of a complementary product  resilience lift eye creme 
initial shipments of idealist skin refinisher as well as sales of other new products  such as body clinique  clinique acne solutions and spotlight skin tone perfector  contributed to improvements in the category  as did a line of origins brand ginger based products  including ginger souffle and ginger body wash 
sales of certain existing products  such as those in the clinique step skin care system  were consistently strong  while others such as diminish and turnaround cream were lower 
makeup our net sales of makeup products increased or million to  million supported by new and existing products  the addition of stila and increased sales of mac products 
sales growth of our mac lines has been achieved through growth in existing business and expansion of both traditional and retail distribution 
new products such as the recently launched magic by prescriptives  city stick and longstemmed lashes contributed to improvements in the category  as did existing products such as long last lipstick and liquid lipstick 
our makeup business also benefited from the domestic launch of go pout lipstick and the rollout of superfit makeup and pure color lipstick internationally 
improvements were partially offset by lower sales of indelible lipstick and smudgesicles 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million 
for the year  sales of tommy hilfiger licensed products improved 
sales of the recently launched freedom for him and freedom for her outpaced decreased sales of existing tommy hilfiger fragrances 
dkny for women was launched domestically and donna karan cashmere mist was rolled out internationally 
both of these products have added to growth in the category 
in its second full fiscal year  sales of clinique happy continued to improve and during fiscal we completed the master brand with the launch of clinique happy for men 
dazzling gold and dazzling silver  which were rolled out in the prior year  caused difficult comparisons for the fragrance category this year 
hair care sales of hair care products increased or million to million primarily due to aveda  driven by an increase in the number of company owned retail stores  the successful introduction of new products and the effect of the acquisitions of third party distributors 
in june  we acquired a majority interest in bumble and bumble 
bumble and bumble offers an array of prestige styling and other hair care products  which are sold to exclusive salons and spas 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions sales in the americas increased or million to  million 
this increase was driven by sales of new and existing products across all categories and growth in our newer brands 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million 
the increase was primarily the result of higher net sales in spain  italy  france and the travel retail business  partially offset by lower sales in germany 
also contributing to regional sales growth were sales by jo malone  which was acquired in october excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales in europe  the middle east africa increased 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million  reflecting increases in all regions  particularly japan  korea  taiwan and australia 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific sales grew over the prior year period 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million or to million from million last year 
cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased basis points to from  reflecting changes in product distribution  as well as the impact of our production and sourcing initiatives 
changes in product distribution include the rollout of our own retail stores and the acquisition of certain distributor operations both of which contributed to higher gross margins 
in addition  our cost of sales reduction program had a favorable impact on gross margins of products offered by our newer acquisitions 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
this change primarily relates to increased costs of new modified channels of distribution  which have higher operating cost structures than our traditional channels  as well as higher depreciation and amortization 
operating expenses are subject to the timing of advertising and promotional spending due to product launches and rollouts as well as incremental advertising in select markets 
operating income operating income increased or million to million as compared with growth to million last year 
operating margins were of net sales in the current period as compared to 
the increase in operating income and margins was due to higher net sales coupled with production efficiencies achieved and changes in distribution  partially offset by planned increases in selling  general and administrative spending related to businesses acquired and new modified channels of distribution 
product categories operating income increased in the skin care  makeup and hair care categories by  and  respectively  primarily due to sales growth 
fragrance operating income increased as strong sales increases in the early portion of the year gave way to softer sales in the latter half  while planned advertising and promotional spending was relatively constant throughout the year 
the advertising and promotion for fragrance indirectly supports other categories by generating increased traffic at points of sale 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million primarily due to increases in skin care product sales  as well as the inclusion of operating results from recent acquisitions 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million reflecting improved operating results in spain  italy and the travel retail business 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million due to improved results in taiwan  japan  korea and australia 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is an additional measure of operating performance used by management 
ebitda  like operating income  does not include the effects of interest and taxes and additionally excludes the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization on current earnings 
while the components of ebitda may vary from company to company  we exclude minority interest adjustments  all depreciation charges related to property  plant and equipment and all amortization charges including amortization of goodwill  purchased royalty rights  leasehold improvements and other intangible assets 
these components of operating income do not necessarily result in a capital requirement in the current period  and  in the opinion of management  many of the underlying assets  both tangible and intangible  create value by supporting the global recognition of brand names and product innovation and by consistently producing quality products for our customers and consumers 
while we consider ebitda useful in analyzing our results  it is not intended to replace  or act as a substitute for  any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda increased to million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales last year 
the improvement in ebitda is primarily attributable to improvements in gross profit related to sales growth and production efficiencies achieved 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this net increase reflects lower interest income from investments  related to lower average cash balances  partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from our management of interest rates and short term borrowings 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared with in the prior year 
these rates are higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state and local taxes  higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally attributable to tax planning initiatives and reduction of certain local market statutory tax rates 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased in all product categories and all geographic segments resulting in an increase in fiscal net sales of to  million 
hair care and makeup benefited from a full year of sales of aveda and jane products 
new skin care products were well received driving growth in that category 
internationally  the europe  middle east africa region contributed a increase in net sales over the prior year 
foreign currency translation did not significantly impact net sales 
product categories skin care skin care sales increased to  million  reflecting the launch of stop signs and resilience lift and a full year of sales of diminish internationally 
in addition to these increases  clinique all about eyes contributed to the category s year over year improvement 
the overall increase was partially offset by lower net sales of fruition extra 
makeup net sales of makeup products increased to  million due in part to the inclusion of a full year of sales of aveda and jane products 
the current year launch of quickliner for eyes  superfit makeup and sheer powder blusher increased sales  and two in one eyeshadow  doublewear and photochrome experienced continued success 
these increases were partially offset by the anniversary of the fiscal launch of superlast cream lipstick 
fragrance fragrance sales increased to  million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the worldwide success of clinique happy and the fiscal introduction of dazzling gold and dazzling silver 
the rollout of hilfiger athletics and tommy girl into remaining international markets contributed to higher fragrance sales  offset in part by lower sales of tommy 
hair care net sales of hair care products increased million or to million 
this increase primarily reflected the inclusion of aveda products for a full year 
geographic regions sales in the americas were  million representing a increase 
the region benefited from the inclusion of a full year of sales of aveda and jane products as well as strong sales from new skin care products 
net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased to  million with double digit sales increases in the skin care and fragrance categories 
net sales in spain  the united kingdom  italy  germany  france  belgium and the distributor and travel retail businesses all increased as we introduced new products and rolled out products that were previously not available in the region 
in asia pacific  net sales increased to million  primarily due to higher net sales in japan  korea and thailand  offset by slightly lower sales in australia and hong kong 
currency translation did not have a material impact on any of these geographic segments 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales was in fiscal and  reflecting the integration of aveda and jane products  which have higher product cost structures than our other brands  offset by continued cost reduction efforts and a shift in product mix for our core brands 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was the result of productivity gains in advertising and promotional spending and other cost controls  partially offset by a full year of goodwill amortization and incremental spending related to our year remediation program 
shifts in product mix and the timing and type of new product introductions affect our level of selling  advertising and promotional spending 
in addition to these market influences  our ratio of operating expenses to net sales benefited from the integration of favorable operating cost structures of acquired companies 
operating income operating income increased to million and operating margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases were achieved by maintaining our gross profit margins and controlling certain operating expenses so they increased at a lower rate than net sales 
product categories operating income in the skin care category increased to million due primarily to the launches of stop signs and resilience lift 
skin care products  which are primarily marketed under our core brand names  typically have lower cost of goods than our other products 
operating income for makeup increased to million as a result of higher sales from new product introductions including quickliner for eyes  superfit makeup and sheer powder blusher 
operating income for fragrance products was million  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales from the introduction of dazzling gold and dazzling silver and the continued success of clinique happy 
operating income from fragrances as a percent of net sales is typically lower than other product segments as fragrance products generally have a higher cost of goods and are often supported by higher advertising and promotional spending 
the higher advertising and promotion for fragrance indirectly supports other categories by generating increased traffic at points of sale 
operating income from the hair care category increased to million primarily due to the inclusion of aveda products for a full year 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased to million primarily due to increased sales in the skin care and makeup segments  as well as a full year of operating profits from aveda 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased to million as a result of a strong travel retail business and better operating results in spain  germany  italy and belgium  partially offset by lower results in the united kingdom 
in asia pacific  operating income increased million or to million due to increased sales and the implementation of planned operating expense efficiencies in japan  australia  taiwan and thailand 
ebitda ebitda increased by million to million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal such improvement was primarily attributable to higher net sales and operating expense efficiencies achieved 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased million to million as borrowings related to fiscal business acquisitions were outstanding for the full year 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
these rates are higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state and local taxes  higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was principally attributable to tax planning initiatives and the tax effect of foreign operations 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  the board of directors has authorized a million commercial paper program  under which we have issued  and intend to issue  commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a by standard poor s and a by moody s 
in may  we issued million of commercial paper and used the proceeds to prepay a like amount of our million term loan  due february there remains million of the original term loan outstanding with an effective interest rate of 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to million in debt securities 
commercial paper is classified as long term debt in our balance sheet based upon our intent and ability to refinance maturing commercial paper on a long term basis 
it is our policy to maintain backup facilities to support our commercial paper program  and its classification as long term debt 
as of june   we had an unused million revolving credit facility  expiring july  our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
to meet these needs  we could issue up to an additional million of commercial paper under our program 
we also have million in uncommitted facilities 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities as of june  total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june   primarily as a result of higher total capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these increases primarily relate to increased earnings  particularly before depreciation and amortization  as well as higher accrual balances  partially due to business acquisitions 
the increase in other noncurrent liabilities is partially due to deferred compensation arrangements and pension obligations 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investment spending in fiscal reflects capital expenditures and business acquisitions including the purchase of the stila  jo malone  gloss 
com and bumble and bumble businesses  as well as certain aveda distributors in the united states and united kingdom  and certain aveda retail stores 
lower cash used for investing activities in fiscal related primarily to lower spending on acquisitions as compared to fiscal  when we acquired aveda  jane and the remaining interest in mac cash used for financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as compared to million provided in fiscal the increase in cash used in the most recent year primarily relates to common stock repurchases and higher common stock dividends  primarily as a result of a higher dividend per share 
a significant portion of the funds provided in fiscal pertained to the issuance of debt related to business acquisitions 
in september  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program 
we have purchased  and may continue to purchase  over an unspecified period of time  a total of up to eight million shares of class a common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
to date  we have purchased approximately million shares under this program 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflects the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements  as well as incremental capital spending by acquired companies 
dividends declared were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  the board of directors declared  and we paid  quarterly dividends on our class a and class b common stock at the rate of 
per share 
the board of directors approved a dividend of 
per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in each quarter of fiscal  thus accounting for the difference in dividends declared 
in fiscal  and  dividends declared on such common stock totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
derivative financial instruments we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into interest rate swaps and options to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows which we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of these exposures are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
any gains realized on such options that qualify as hedges are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
premiums on foreign currency options are amortized over the period being hedged 
foreign currency transactions which do not qualify as hedges are marked to market on a current basis with gains and losses recognized through income and reflected in operating expenses 
in addition  any previously deferred gains and losses on hedges which are terminated prior to the transaction date are recognized in current income when the hedge is terminated 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of loss is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding months 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of million 
the foreign currencies included in these contracts are principally the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and uk pound 
interest rate risk management we have entered into interest rate swaps to convert floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
these swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
amounts currently due to or from interest swap counterparties are recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in other accrued liabilities 
at june  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional principal amount of million 
in february and april  we terminated interest rate swaps at a gain under contracts with notional values of million and million  respectively 
in order to maintain interest rate protection  we used a portion of the proceeds to purchase interest rate options set at the same rate  and at the same aggregate notional value  as the previously terminated interest rate swaps 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk from holding such derivative instruments  using a variance co variance model with a percent confidence level  assuming normal market conditions at june   was not material 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in the portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal quarter beginning july  date of transition and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
this statement requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if certain conditions are met  where the derivative instrument has been designated as a fair value hedge  the hedged item may also be marked to market through earnings thus creating an offset 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument may be recorded on the balance sheet as other comprehensive income 
the new accounting standard has not significantly changed our approach to managing foreign currency or interest rate risks  as discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
we principally hedge against these exposures using forward exchange contracts  foreign currency options and interest rate swaps and options 
these contracts have been designated as hedges of anticipated future cash flows and  accordingly  will be marked to market through other comprehensive income balance sheet adjustments until such time as the related forecasted transactions affect earnings 
although we expect future gains and losses to be effectively matched  there is a change associated with sfas no 
that may accelerate certain other charges to earnings 
under this new guidance  the time value component of a derivative s fair value is charged to earnings based upon the change in its relative proportion to the contract s total value 
to reflect the change in time value from the date of the contracts inception through the date of transition we will record an earnings charge of million  after tax  in our fiscal first quarter consolidated statement of earnings 
this charge will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
additionally  on the date of transition  a comparable amount of deferred unrealized gains on these instruments will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income that we expect to accrete into earnings over the remaining life of the derivatives through february 
in may  the emerging issues task force the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
accounting for certain sales incentives 
this consensus addresses when sales incentives and discounts should be recognized  as well as where the related revenues and expenses should be classified in a registrant s financial statements 
if the eitf s consensus is unchanged  issue no 
will become effective in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december   and would be applied retroactively for purposes of comparability 
therefore  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we may be required to reclassify certain revenues and expenses related to our promotional programs out of operating expenses and into sales and cost of sales 
we have not yet fully quantified the reclassification  however  by its nature  a reclassification will not affect our operating income or net earnings 
internet our strategic goals for the internet are to enhance our brand equities  to reach new consumers  to forge deeper relationships with existing consumers and to strengthen our business through our traditional retailers 
the strategy includes a planned launch of a multi brand website offering products from our portfolio  specially designed sites which will be available through the e commerce sites of retailers who meet specific requirements and individual sites for our brands 
we currently have nine individual brand websites that educate and inform consumers about specific brands  with more in development 
four of the existing sites clinique 
com  origins 
com  bobbibrown 
com and maccosmetics 
com have e commerce capabilities 
we are currently re developing the gloss 
com multi brand site we acquired in may and expect to re launch it in the third quarter of fiscal the site initially will feature estee lauder  clinique  origins  bobbi brown essentials  and mac products 
the site also will feature products from chanel  inc and clarins usa inc 
which became co venturers in gloss 
com in august our internet sales  which were not significant during fiscal  are currently limited to consumers in the united states and canada 
the initial impact of our overall internet strategy on earnings is expected to be immaterially dilutive  particularly as we re develop the multi brand site  and accretive some time after the re launch 
euro conversion under the direction of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which we conduct business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies were fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies to be removed from circulation between january and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities  as well as individuals  may pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euros or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there is a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to use the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  we were euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euros as requested as of january  in the affected countries 
full conversion of all affected country operations to the euro is expected to be completed by the time national currencies are removed from circulation 
phased conversion to the euro is currently underway and the effects on revenues  costs and various business strategies continue to be assessed 
the cost of software and business process conversion is not expected to be material
