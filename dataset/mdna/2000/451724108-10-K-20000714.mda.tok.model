on march   pentegra acquired simultaneously with the closing of its initial public offering ipo  substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets  and assumed the liabilities  of affiliated practices 
pentegra also began to provide practice management services to professional corporations or associations owned by the dentist owners of those affiliated practices one of which split into two separate dental practices immediately after the ipo pursuant to long term management service agreements entered into at the time of the ipo 
throughout fiscal  pentegra added affiliate practices 
during fiscal  pentegra affiliated with an additional practices 
due primarily to dentist disabilities  practices have discontinued their affiliation with pentegra

community dental and professional idea communication in chat rooms and message boards purchasing dental supplies and equipment purchasing from major suppliers to all dentists the company has developed a web site and executed various channel partnership agreements with other entities to help provide the on line services 
in early may  the company launched the first generation web site 
in july  the company modified approximately half of its management service agreements and intends to modify a substantial portion of the remaining management services agreements  to a shorter term from year terms of five years  and decrease and fix the future monthly management fees 
the new service agreement will modify the type of services the company will provide each affiliated practice 
the modification of the terms include the following the payroll and payables process will cease

all employees will become employees of the dentists and payroll will be processed at the practice level 
management fees will be of fiscal year fees and fixed for three years  drawn weekly at the agreed upon fixed amount 
all accounts receivable currently outstanding will be paid  either in cash or by signing a three year  interest bearing note at 
assets and other equipment will be transferred back to the doctors at the end of the amended management service agreement terms  at a nominal value 
based on the proposed modifications of the management services agreements that must be accepted by both the company and affiliated practice  the company has prepared an analysis to determine the recoverability of the management service agreement intangible asset grouped at the practice level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the company has prepared the analysis by calculating the expected undiscounted future cash flows under the proposed amendments to the management service agreements less the carrying amount of the intangible asset and has determined that the majority of the intangible asset will be impaired 
the company will recognize an impairment charge when and if its proposed modifications are accepted by the affiliated practice 
there is no assurance which affiliated practices will accept the proposed modification  however  if accepted the amount of the impairment is estimated to be approximately million if substantially all of the affiliated practices accept the proposed modifications  and will be recorded in the period in which the management service agreements are amended 
the periods effected are anticipated to be the quarters ending june and september  during the fiscal  the company incurred a net loss of approximately million and has an accumulated deficit of million at march  in addition  the company used cash flow from operations of  during the period ended march  as discussed in note of the financial statements  at march   the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants of the line of credit

the company has prepared financial projections for the periods through fiscal year ended march   and believes it will be in compliance with its financial covenants 
no additional borrowings are permitted under the amendment 
as discussed above  the bank credit facility due date has been extended to july  based upon its current strategy to enhance cash collections and reduce costs  the company projects to have sufficient funds to meet its operating capital requirements through the fiscal year ending march   however  there would not be sufficient cash flow to fund the credit agreement obligation due july  management believes it will be able to replace the credit facility with other financing alternatives or refinance its current line of credit 
there is no assurance that other financing or refinancing of its current line of credit will be available in sufficient amounts  if at all  and there can be no assurance that the related terms and conditions will be acceptable to the company 
failure of the company to obtain such alternative financing or refinancing of its current line of credit would have a material and adverse effect on the company s financial position 
in order to increase its liquidity  the company has developed the following strategies  i suspension of its new practice affiliation program  ii implement its revised ecommerce based strategic alternative described above  iii implement more rigid credit policies with its affiliated practices  iv consider terminating the services agreements of selected underperforming affiliated practices  v reducing costs in the company s corporate office  and vi raising additional capital 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies will be achieved
