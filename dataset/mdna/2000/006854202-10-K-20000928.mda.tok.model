item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide intelligent production automation solutions to our customers in many industries including the semiconductor  communications  photonics  food  automotive  life sciences and electronics industries 
we utilize our comprehensive portfolio of high precision mechanical components and application development software to deliver automation solutions that meet our customer s increasingly complex manufacturing requirements 
we offer our customers a comprehensive and tailored automation solution that we call rapid deployment automation  or rda  that reduces the time and cost to design  engineer and launch products into high volume production 
our products currently include simulation software  machine vision systems  machine controllers for robot mechanisms and other flexible automation equipment  and a family of mechanisms including robots  linear modules  vision based flexible part feeders  as well as a line of cartesian scalable robots targeted for the electronics and assembly applications markets 
in recent years  we have expanded our robot product lines and developed advanced software and sensing technologies that have enabled robots to perform a wider range of functions 
most recently  we announced a new line of robots expressly designed for use in the semiconductor fabrication industry 
we have also expanded our channel of system integrators and our international sales and marketing operations 
as a result of these developments  the nature and composition of our revenues have changed over time 
specifically  software license and service revenues  although still relatively insignificant  have increased as a percentage of total revenues in recent periods  and international sales comprise approximately between of revenues on any given quarter 
we expect that this trend will continue 
we market and sell our products worldwide through more than system integrators  our direct sales force and oems 
system integrators and oems add application specific hardware and software to our products  enabling us to provide solutions to a diversified industry base  including the electronics  communications  semiconductor  appliances  pharmaceutical  food processing and automotive components industries 
due to a worldwide slowdown in disk drive markets and to a lesser extent the communications and semiconductor markets  our net revenues have declined in four of the last six fiscal quarters 
for example  our net revenues decreased as a result of reduced product bookings in each of the three previous fiscal quarters ending march in addition  during the fiscal quarter ending september fiscal our revenue declined for similar reasons 
as a whole  our revenues were adversely affected by a decline in orders from customers primarily in the disk drive industry during fiscal and fiscal and to a lesser extent the communications markets in fiscal although our revenues increased in the last quarter of fisca  this increase may not be indicative of increased future revenues or a sustainable recovery in our product markets 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the three year period ended june   referred to as fiscal   and unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
during the three year period ended june   adept acquired four companies  as described below 
adept s acquisitions of nanomotion and pensar completed during have been accounted for as purchases  with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
the company s mergers with bye oasis in and roboelektronik in have been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
nanomotion on may   we completed the acquisition of nanomotion incorporated  a california corporation 
nanomotion is a manufacturer of ultra high precision positioning and alignment stages and devices 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to the shareholders of nanomotion valued at per share  which was the fair market value of our common stock at may  pensar on april   we completed the acquisition of pensar tucson  inc  an arizona corporation 
pensar is a precision automation integrator of standard work cells 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to the shareholders of pensar valued at per share  which was the fair market value of our common stock at april  in addition  we paid  in cash  resulting in a total purchase price of million 
bye oasis on july   we completed the acquisition of bye oasis engineering inc  a texas corporation 
bye oasis is a manufacturer of mini environment systems and smif for the microelectronics industry 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to the shareholders of bye oasis 
in addition  we assumed outstanding options to acquire bye oasis shares  which were converted into options to acquire  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition constituted a tax free reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and  accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of bye oasis 
prior to the merger  bye oasis s fiscal year ended on september in recording the business combination  bye oasis s prior period financial statements have been restated to conform to our fiscal year 
prior to the merger  bye oasis s fiscal year ended on september bye oasis s prior period financial statements have been restated to conform to adept s year end 
roboelektronik on february   we completed the acquisition of roboelektronik gmbh roboelektronik through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock  which were exchanged for all of the outstanding capital stock of roboelektronik 
roboelektronik gmbh was renamed adept technology  gmbh on june  the results of operations of roboelektronik have been consolidated with adept s financial statements since the acquisition 
results of operations comparison of to net revenues 
our net revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase in net revenues for over was primarily due to strong demand in the semiconductor and electronic industries 
although we experienced some improvement in our targeted markets in fiscal  we cannot predict if this improvement will continue in the market we currently serve 
international sales  including sales to canada and export sales  were million or of net revenues in as compared with million  or of net revenues  in international revenue as a percentage of total net revenues decreased due to the addition of our semiconductor business whose revenue was derived primarily from domestic sources in domestic semiconductor revenue was greater than our international semiconductor revenue causing the total international revenue as a percent of total revenue to decline 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was in compared to in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in operational and manufacturing overhead expenses related to supplier changes during the first quarter of fiscal and general increases in component costs 
we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our gross margin percentage due to changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration and changes in sales mix 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses increased by to million  or of net revenues in  from million  or of net revenues in the absolute dollar increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses of million  increases in project and operating expenses which were million  partially offset by decreased spending in outside services 
research  development and engineering expenses in were partially offset by approximately  of third party development funding as compared with  of third party development funding in we expect to continue to receive third party development funding from the federal government as well as other third parties during but anticipate a decrease in this funding as compared to funding received in there can be no assurance that any funds budgeted by the government or other third parties for our development projects will not be curtailed or eliminated at any time 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues in the increased level of spending was primarily attributable to increases in corporate administration expenses of million related to the opening of new sales offices  increases in payroll and related expenses of million due to increased headcount from acquisition activity  and increases in travel expenses of  associated with increased sales activity 
the increases were partially offset by decreased spending in outside services of  and reduced spending in project supplies 
merger related charges 
merger related charges were  in relating to the acquisition of bye oasis and the closure of bye oasis facilities in texas 
merger related expenses were  expenses relating to the closure of facilities in texas were  and other non recurring expenses relating to the acquisition were  interest income  net 
interest income  net in was  compared to  in the decrease was primarily as a result of a lower interest yield rate on investments in compared to provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to for our tax rate for differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of foreign tax and other federal and state credits in in  our tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to future foreign losses not utilized for us federal and state tax purposes and foreign taxes  partially offset by the benefits of federal and state tax credits 
derivative financial instruments 
our product sales are predominantly denominated in us dollars 
however  certain international operating expenses are predominately paid in their respective local currency 
during  we began a foreign currency hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on local international operational expenses and revenues 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward currency contracts that are effective as hedges of assets and liabilities  are recognized in income 
we recognized losses of  for the year ended june  we make yen denominated purchases of certain components and mechanical subsystems from japanese suppliers 
based on the amount of such purchases  current exchange rate fluctuations would not typically be expected to result in material unfavorable foreign exchange transactions included in cost of revenues 
from time to time  we manage the currency risk associated with the yen denominated purchases using forward rate currency contracts 
comparison of to net revenues 
our net revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in net revenues for over was primarily due to decreased product sales  including robot and motion controller sales  decreased service and upgrade revenues  offset in part by increased software revenue  primarily from our silma products 
revenue growth slowed substantially starting in the second half of as a result of lower sales to the customers in the computer disk drive  communications  semiconductor and electronics industries 
additionally  while our direct sales into the asia pacific region have been relatively insignificant to date  the widely reported economic instability in that region has affected certain domestic and oem customers who have experienced a decline in their asia pacific revenues 
the revenue decline continued into fiscal and was seen throughout the markets and industries we serve 
international sales  including sales to canada and export sales  were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared with million  or of net revenues  in international sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased due to the greater relative decline in our domestic sales in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
because international revenues constitute a significant portion of our net revenues  adverse economic conditions or instability in foreign markets where we operate directly can be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  fluctuations in economic conditions internationally can also affect our revenues and operating results indirectly to the extent significant customers or industry segments on which we are significantly dependent are affected by such international fluctuations 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was in compared to in the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to reduced sales of lower margin hardware products  and to a lesser extent  to relatively higher margin software revenue and cost reductions on our products 
we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross margin percentage due to changes in our sales and product mix 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses decreased by to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues  in the absolute dollar decrease in expenses in was primarily due to decreased project material spending  and travel expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in were partially offset by  of third party development funding as compared with  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the decreased level of spending was primarily attributable to the closure of our japanese office  lower compensation related expenses  including commissions of  and to a lesser extent  to lower travel expenses of  reduced foreign currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement of  partially offset by an increase in outside consulting services of  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was due to the relative decline in the level of net revenues 
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 
we did not incur any restructuring or other nonrecurring charges in during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million and other nonrecurring charges of approximately million 
the restructuring charges of million included a write off of certain assets and excess facilities equal to  in connection with the closing of our branch in japan 
we now operate in japan through a joint venture in which we have a minority interest 
the remaining  relates to severance for the termination of certain employees 
the nonrecurring charges of approximately million included  for non cash compensation expenses related to our employee stock purchase plan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  related to the write off of certain information system hardware and software which had become obsolete 
additionally   was related to the write off of the remaining balance of capitalized purchased software associated with the acquisition of silma 
due to technological changes in related to the silma operating platform  we determined the net realizable value of the purchased software was impaired 
we reported the charge of  in the second quarter of fiscal for compensation expense related to the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for increased share authorizations in an irs section employee stock purchase plan under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees which was approved by the eitf in september this nonrecurring  non cash charge represented the difference between of the fair market value of common stock on the date of the beginning of the offering period and the fair market value of common stock on the date the shareholders approved the increase in shares authorized for issuance  multiplied by the number of shares in the employee stock purchase plan  or espp  that had been subscribed for purchase by employees  but not authorized by the shareholders  prior to our annual meeting of shareholders 
shareholder approval was granted to make available for issuance an additional  shares under the espp on october  interest income  net 
interest income  net in was  compared to  in the decrease was due to a higher concentration of tax advantaged investments yielding lower gross interest income 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to in our tax rates for and differed from the federal statutory rate of  due to foreign losses not utilized for us federal and state tax purposes and foreign taxes  partially offset by the benefits of federal and state tax credits 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on our business and financial position has not been significant to date 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
during the year ended june   cash and short term investments decreased by approximately million 
these funds were primarily used to acquire pensar and nanomotion see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we made investments in inventories for safety stock related to components with long lead times 
generally other cash requirements during the year ended june  were met primarily through cash provided by investing activities and financing activities partially offset by cash used in operating activities 
specifically  cash and cash equivalents increased million from june  primarily as a result of million provided by investing activities and million provided by financing activities offset by million used in operations 
net cash used by operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss adjusted by depreciation and amortization and the increase in inventory and accounts receivable 
cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from employee stock options and stock purchase plans 
cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to the net sales of short term investments offset by business acquisitions and the purchase of property and equipment 
we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as short term investments and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal new accounting pronouncements staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements or sab sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
in recent actions  the sec has further delayed the required implementation date which  for us  will be the fourth quarter of fiscal  retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year 
the sec has indicated that additional implementation guidance will be forthcoming in the form of frequently asked questions  however  such guidance has not been issued to date 
we cannot fully assess the impact of sab until the additional guidance from the sec is issued 
accordingly we are still in the process of assessing the impact of sab on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows based upon the most current information 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and  establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we will be required to implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of our fiscal year our foreign currency exchange rate hedging activities have been insignificant to date and we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
reclassification certain amounts presented in the financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation for acquisitions to expand our capabilities in the manufacturing and marketing of precision robotics  simulation and motion control products for production environments  automated material handling and assembly  and to strengthen our core business  we completed the following acquisitions during the three year period ended june  may  acquisition of nanomotion incorporated  a developer and manufacturer of advanced nanometer and sub nanometer positioning and alignment systems 
we believe this acquisition will facilitate expansion of our leadership role in precision robotics by adding nanomotion s rugged  production ready micro and nano positioning mechanisms to adept s product offerings 
april  acquisition of pensar tucson inc  a design engineering automation company specializing in advanced material handling and assembly processes 
we believe this acquisition will expand our high precision and fiber optic assembly offerings 
july  acquisition of bye oasis engineering incorporated  a manufacturer of mini environment microenvironment systems and smif interfaces for the microelectronics industry 
we believe this acquisition will broaden our factory automation offerings in the wafer and microelectronic manufacturing industry experience and marketing and service infrastructure 
february  acquisition of roboelectronik  an automation consulting business based in munich  germany 
we believe this acquisition will enhance adept s ability to provide systems integrators and oems throughout europe with customized consulting services 
factors affecting future operating results risks related to our business you should not rely on our past results to predict our future performance because our operating results fluctuate due to factors which are difficult to forecast 
our past revenue growth and other operating results may not be accurate indicators of our future performance 
our quarterly operating results have been subject to significant fluctuations in the past  and we expect this to continue in the future 
the factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include o fluctuations in capital spending  cyclicality and other economic conditions domestically and internationally in one or more industries in which we sell our products  o new product introductions by us or by our competitors  o changes in product mix and pricing by us  our suppliers or our competitors  o availability of components and raw materials for our products  o our failure to manufacture a sufficient volume of products in a timely and cost effective manner  o our failure to anticipate the changing product requirements of our customers  o a change in market acceptance of our products or a shift in demand for our products  o changes in the mix of sales by distribution channels  o exchange rate fluctuations  and o extraordinary events such as litigation or acquisitions 
our gross margins may vary greatly depending on the mix of sales of lower margin hardware products  particularly mechanical subsystems purchased from third party vendors  and higher margin software products 
our operating results may also be affected by general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
for example  our operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the first three quarters of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal were adversely affected by a continuing downturn in hardware purchases by customers in the electronics industry  particularly disk drive manufacturers and to a lesser extent communication manufacturers 
we cannot estimate when or if a sustained revival in these key hardware markets will occur 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment or  for certain international sales  upon receipt by the customers 
as a result  our net revenues and results of operations for a fiscal period will be affected by the timing of orders received and orders shipped during the period 
a delay in shipments near the end of a fiscal period  for example  due to product development delays or delays in obtaining materials may cause sales to fall below expectations and harm our operating results for the period 
in addition  our continued investments in research and development  capital equipment and ongoing customer service and support capabilities result in significant fixed costs that we cannot reduce rapidly 
as a result  if our sales for a particular fiscal period are below expected levels  our operating results for the period could be materially adversely affected 
in the event that in some future fiscal quarter our net revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may fall 
we may not be able to increase or sustain our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
sales of our products depend on the capital spending habits of our customers  which tend to be cyclical 
intelligent automation systems using our products can range in price from  to several million dollars 
accordingly  our success is directly dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
our future operations may be subject to substantial fluctuations as a consequence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  industry patterns and other factors affecting capital spending 
although the majority of our international customers are not in the asia pacific region  we believe that any instability in the asia pacific economies could also have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations as a result of a reduction in sales by our customers to those markets 
domestic or international recessions or a downturn in one or more of our major markets  such as the electronics  communications  semiconductor  appliances  pharmaceutical  food processing or automotive components industries  and resulting cutbacks in capital spending would have a direct  negative impact on our business 
we sell some of our products to the semiconductor industry  which is subject to sudden  extreme  cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the timing  length and severity of these cycles are difficult to predict 
in some cases  these cycles have lasted more than a year 
semiconductor manufacturers may contribute to these cycles by misinterpreting the conditions in the industry and over or under investing in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and equipment 
we may not be able to respond effectively to these industry cycles 
downturns in the semiconductor industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
industry downturns have been characterized by reduced demand for semiconductor devices and equipment  production over capacity and accelerated decline in average selling prices 
during a period of declining demand  we must be able to quickly and effectively reduce expenses and motivate and retain key employees 
our ability to reduce expenses in response to any downturn in the semiconductor industry is limited by our need for continued investment in engineering and research and development and extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements 
the long lead time for production and delivery of some of our products creates a risk that we may incur expenditures or purchase inventories for products which we cannot sell 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could therefore harm our revenues and gross margin if demand drops or average selling prices decline 
industry upturns have been characterized by abrupt increases in demand for semiconductor devices and equipment and production under capacity 
during a period of increasing demand and rapid growth  we must be able to quickly increase manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and hire and assimilate a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
our inability to ramp up in times of increased demand could harm our reputation and cause some of our existing or potential customers to place orders with our competitors 
many of the key components and materials of our products come from single source suppliers and their procurement requires lengthy lead times 
we obtain many key components and materials and some significant mechanical subsystems from sole or single source suppliers with whom we have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
in addition  some of our sole or single sourced components and mechanical subsystems incorporated into our products have long procurement lead times 
our reliance on sole or single source suppliers involves certain significant risks including o loss of control over the manufacturing process  o potential absence of adequate supplier capacity  o potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  materials or mechanical subsystems  and o reduced control over manufacturing yields  costs  timely delivery  reliability and quality of components  materials and mechanical subsystems 
we depend on sanmina corporation for the supply of our circuit boards  nsk ppd  inc for the supply of our linear modules  yaskawa for the supply of our axis robots  samsung for the supply of semiconductor robots  hirata corporation for the supply of our adept cobra and adept cobra robot mechanisms and iti matrox for the supply of our vision boards 
if any one of these significant sole or single source supplier were unable or unwilling to manufacture the components  materials or mechanical subsystems we need in the volumes we require  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
the process of qualifying suppliers may be lengthy  and additional sources may not be available to us on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
if supplies of these items were not available from our existing suppliers and a relationship with an alternative vendor could not be developed in a timely manner  shipments of our products could be interrupted and reengineering of such products could be required 
in the past  we have experienced quality control or specification problems with certain key components provided by sole source suppliers  and have had to design around the particular flawed item 
we have also experienced delays in filling customer orders due to the failure of certain suppliers to meet our volume and schedule requirements 
some of our suppliers have also ceased manufacturing components that we require for our products  and we have been required to purchase sufficient supplies for the estimated life of its product line 
problems of this nature with our suppliers may occur in the future 
disruption or termination of our supply sources could require us to seek alternative sources of supply  and could delay our product shipments and damage relationships with current and prospective customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we incorrectly forecast product mix for a particular period and we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of any components or mechanical subsystems on a timely basis due to long procurement lead times  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be substantially impaired 
moreover  if demand for a product for which we have purchased a substantial amount of components fails to meet our expectations  we would be required to write off the excess inventory 
a prolonged inability to obtain adequate timely deliveries of key components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because our product sales are seasonal  we may not be able to maintain a steady revenue stream 
our product sales are seasonal 
we have historically had higher bookings for our products during the june quarter of each fiscal year and lower bookings during the september quarter of each fiscal year  due primarily to the slowdown in sales to european markets and summer vacations 
in the event bookings for our products in the june fiscal quarter are lower than anticipated and our backlog at the end of the june fiscal quarter is insufficient to compensate for lower bookings in the september fiscal quarter  our results of operations for the september fiscal quarter and future quarters will suffer 
for example  with the exception of the quarter ending march  our net revenues decreased as a result of reduced product bookings in each of the two previous fiscal quarters ending december in addition  during the quarter ending september our revenue declined for similar reasons 
as a whole  our revenues were adversely affected by a decline in orders from customers primarily in the disk drive industry during fiscal and fiscal and to a lesser extent the communications markets in fiscal a significant percentage of our product shipments occur in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
historically  this has been due in part  at times  to our inability to forecast the level of demand for our products or of the product mix for a particular fiscal quarter 
to address this problem we periodically stock inventory levels of completed robots  machine controllers and certain strategic components 
if shipments of our products fail to meet forecasted levels  the increased inventory levels and increased operating expenses in anticipation of sales that do not materialize could adversely affect our business 
orders constituting our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and customer cancellations resulting in lower than expected revenues backlog should not be relied on as a measure of anticipated activity or future revenues  because the orders constituting our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances are subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer 
we have in the past experienced changes in delivery schedules and customer cancellations that resulted in our revenues in a given quarter being materially less than would have been anticipated based on backlog at the beginning of the quarter 
similar delivery schedule changes and order cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in the future 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  they may cease purchasing our products at any time 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers are not required to make minimum purchases and may cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty 
because our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order 
any reductions  cancellations or deferrals in customer orders could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have begun development of intelligent automation solutions for the photonics industry  and our entry into this industry will require us to develop significant new capabilities and may not be successful 
we have begun development of intelligent automation solutions targeted at the photonics industry 
we expect to devote significant financial  engineering and management resources to develop and market these solutions 
our success in the photonics industry depends upon our ability to  among other things o accurately determine the features and functionality that our photonics customers require or prefer  o successfully design and implement intelligent automation solutions that include these features and functionality  o enter into agreements with system integrators  manufacturers and distributors  and o achieve market acceptance for our photonics solutions 
our photonics solutions may not achieve broad market acceptance for a variety of reasons including o photonics companies may continue their current production methods and may not adopt our intelligent automation solutions  o photonics companies may determine that the costs and resources required to switch to our intelligent automation solutions are unacceptable to them  o system integrators  manufacturers  and oems may not enter into agreements with us  and o competition from traditional  well established photonics manufacturing methods 
we have limited experience in developing and marketing products for the photonics industry 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance of products for the photonics industry  our ability to increase our revenue may be limited and our business and our results of operations will suffer 
we charge a fixed price for a certain products which may make us vulnerable to cost overruns 
our operating results fluctuate when our gross margins vary 
our gross margins vary for a number of reasons  including o the mix of products we sell  o the average selling prices of products we sell  o the costs to manufacture  market  service and support our new products and enhancements  o the costs to customize our systems  and o our efforts to enter new markets 
we charge a fixed price for certain of our products  including the products that we added as a result of our acquisition of pensar 
if the costs we incur in completing a customer order for these products exceed our expectations  we generally cannot pass those costs on to our customer 
we have significant fixed costs which are not easily reduced during a downturn 
we continue to invest in research and development  capital equipment and extensive ongoing customer service and support capability worldwide 
these investments create significant fixed costs that we may be unable to reduce rapidly if we do not meet our sales goals 
moreover  if we fail to obtain a significant volume of customer orders for an extended period of time  we may have difficulty planning our future production and inventory levels  which could also cause fluctuations in our operating results 
if our targeted photonics market develops more slowly than we expect  our revenue will not grow as fast as anticipated  if at all 
segments of the photonics market that we target as an element of our growth strategy are either emerging or rapidly changing and the potential size of these market segments and the timing of their development are difficult to predict 
if our targeted segments of this market develop more slowly than we expect  our ability to increase our revenue may be limited 
we depend  in part  upon the broad acceptance by photonic manufacturers of our material handling and component assembly solutions  as well as our simulation software and robot vision and motion control technology 
we rely on systems integrators and oems to sell our products 
we believe that our ability to sell products to system integrators and oems will continue to be important to our success 
our relationships with system integrators and oems are generally not exclusive  and some of our system integrators and oems may expend a significant amount of effort or give higher priority to selling products of our competitors 
in the future  any of our system integrators or our oems may discontinue their relationships with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenues from  system integrators or oems to which we sell a significant amount of our product could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as we enter new geographic and applications markets  we must locate system integrators and oems to assist us in building sales in those markets 
we may not be successful in obtaining effective new system integrators or oems or in maintaining sales relationships with them 
in the event a number of our system integrators and or oems experience financial problems  terminate their relationships with us or substantially reduce the amount of our products they sell  or in the event we fail to build an effective systems integrator or oem channel in any new markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial portion of our sales are to system integrators that specialize in designing and building production lines for manufacturers 
many of these companies are small operations with limited financial resources  and we have from time to time experienced difficulty in collecting payments from certain of these companies 
as a result  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
to the extent we are unable to mitigate this risk of collections from system integrators  our results of operations may be harmed 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increase our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems 
orders expected in one quarter may shift to another quarter or be cancelled as a result of the customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews  and other factors affecting the timing of customers purchase decisions 
in addition  customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations  in some instances evaluating equipment on site  before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product s performance and compatibility with the customer s requirements to place an order 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
in addition  the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their systems can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales  which may not be realized and delay the generation of revenue 
our international operations may subject us to divergent regulatory requirements and other risks that may harm our operating results 
international sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  this represented   and of net revenues for the respective periods 
we also purchase some components and mechanical subsystems from foreign suppliers 
as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales and purchases  which include the following o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o political and economic changes and disruptions  o transportation costs and delays  o foreign currency fluctuations  o export import controls  o tariff regulations and other trade barriers  o higher freight rates  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations  o greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection in foreign jurisdictions  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
foreign exchange fluctuations may render our products less competitive relative to locally manufactured product offerings  or could result in foreign exchange losses 
in calendar  the value of major european currencies has dropped against the us dollar 
to date  we have not reflected that change in currency value in our selling prices 
in order to maintain a competitive price for our products in europe  we may have to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices  resulting in a lower margin on products sold in europe 
continued change in the values of european currencies or changes in the values of other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  duty  tariff and freight costs can materially increase the cost of crucial components for our products 
we anticipate that past turmoil in asian financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain asian countries may continue to have an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose projects are based in those countries due to the impact of restrictions on government spending imposed by the international monetary fund on those countries receiving the international monetary fund s assistance 
in addition  customers in those countries may face reduced access to working capital to fund component purchases  such as our products  due to higher interest rates  reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer s or our bank s financial condition or the inability to access local equity financing 
maintaining operations in different countries requires us to expend significant resources to keep our operations coordinated and subjects us to differing laws and regulatory regimes that may affect our service offerings and revenue 
we may incur currency exchange related losses in connection with our reliance on our single or sole source foreign suppliers 
we make yen denominated purchases of certain components and mechanical subsystems from certain of our sole or single source japanese suppliers 
depending on the amount of yen denominated purchases  we may engage in hedging transactions in the future 
however  notwithstanding these precautions  we remain subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the dates foreign currency export sales or purchase transactions are recorded and the dates cash is received or payments are made in foreign currencies 
our current or any future currency exchange strategy may not be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
any exchange related losses or exposure may negatively effect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our hardware products do not comply with standards set forth by the european union  we will not be able to sell them in europe 
our hardware products are required to comply with european union low voltage  electro magnetic compatibility  and machinery safety directives 
the european union mandates that our products carry the ce mark denoting that these products are manufactured in strict accordance to design guidelines in support of these directives 
these guidelines are subject to change and to varying interpretation 
new guidelines impacting machinery design go into effect each year 
to date  we have retained tuv rheinland to help certify that our controller based products  including some of our robots  meet applicable european union directives and guidelines 
although our existing certified products meet the requirements of the applicable european union directives  we cannot assure that future products can be designed  within market window constraints  to meet the future requirements 
if any of our robot products or any other major hardware products do not meet the requirements of the european union directives  we would be unable to legally sell these products in europe 
thus  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
our hardware and software products may contain defects that could increase our expenses exposure to liabilities and harm our reputation and future business prospects 
our hardware and software products are complex and  despite extensive testing  our new or existing products or enhancements may contain defects  errors or performance problems when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released or even after such products or enhancements have been used in the marketplace for a period of time 
we may discover product defects only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
we may discover defects  errors or performance problems in future shipments of our products 
these problems could result in expensive and time consuming design modifications or large warranty charges  expose us to liability for damages  damage customer relationships and result in loss of market share  any of which could harm our reputation and future business prospects 
in addition  increased development and warranty costs could reduce our operating profits and could result in losses 
the existence of any defects  errors or failures in our products could also lead to product liability claims or lawsuits against us or against our customers 
a successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost and divert management s attention and resources  which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we are not aware of any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of these claims 
our internal systems may experience difficulties responding to the introduction of the single european currency 
we are in the process of addressing the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency  or the euro  as of january  and transition to full adoption as of january  our internal systems that are affected by the initial introduction of the euro were euro capable as of january  we do not presently expect that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities  or our use of derivative instruments  or will result in any material increase in costs to us 
however  we cannot assure that all issues related to the euro conversion have been identified and that any additional issues would not materially hurt our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  the conversion to the euro may have competitive implications on our pricing and marketing strategies and we may be at risk to the extent its principal european suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the euro conversion 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the euro conversion on our currency and hedging activities 
the success of our business depends on our key employees 
we are highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  and product development personnel 
in particular  we would be adversely affected if we were to lose the services of brian carlisle  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  who has provided significant leadership to us since our inception  or bruce shimano  vice president  research and development and a director  who has guided our research and development programs since inception 
in addition  the loss of the services of any of our senior managerial  technical or sales personnel could impair our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers and do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of our key personnel 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
competition for qualified technical personnel in the intelligent automation industry is intense 
our inability to recruit and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis would adversely affect our ability to design  manufacture  market and support our products 
in addition  our success will depend on our ability to hire additional experienced engineers  senior management and sales and marketing personnel 
the robust economy and opportunities available in other high technology companies has made and could continue to make recruiting and retaining employees  especially design engineers  more difficult for us 
competition for these personnel is intense  particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area  where our principal offices are located  and other locations where we maintain design sites 
to attract and retain individuals with the requisite expertise  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be dilutive to shareholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses  which could harm our operating results 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  we will not be able to grow our business and our operation results will be harmed 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed personnel  incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets 
these claims could prevent us from hiring personnel or cause us to incur liability for damages 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves from these claims could divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
if we are unable to identify and make acquisitions  our ability to expand our operations and increase our revenue may suffer 
in the latter half of fiscal  a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions of other businesses and technologies 
although we have no specific commitments or understandings with respect to any acquisitions currently  we expect that acquisitions of complementary companies  products and technologies in the future will play an important role in our ability to expand our operations  hire additional personnel and increase our revenue 
if we are unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms  our ability to expand our service offerings and increase our revenue may be impaired 
even if we are able to identify and acquire acquisition candidates  we may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of these acquisitions 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business  increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition or operations 
during fiscal  we acquired pensar and nanomotion 
in july  we acquired hexavision 
these acquisitions introduced us to industries and technologies in which we have limited previous experience 
in the future we may make material acquisitions of  or large investments in  other businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that management believes will further our strategic objectives 
we cannot be certain that we would successfully integrate any businesses  technologies or personnel that we might acquire  and any acquisitions might divert our management s attention away from our core business 
any future acquisitions or investments we might make would present risks commonly associated with these types of transactions  including o difficulty in combining the product offerings  operations  or work force of an acquired business  o potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business  o adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  o disruptions of our on going businesses  o difficulties in realizing our potential financial and strategic position through the successful integration of the acquired business  o difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  o potential negative impact on results of operation due to amortization of goodwill  other intangible assets acquired or assumption of anticipated liabilities  o risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited previous experience  and o the diversion of management attention 
the risks described above  either individually or in the aggregate  could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
in addition  we may issue additional equity in connection with future acquisitions  which could result in dilution of our shareholders equity interest 
fluctuations in our stock price may make acquisitions more expensive or prevent us from being able to complete on terms that are acceptable to us 
our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive advantage 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the patent and copyright law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  patents issued to adept may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed 
we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
moreover  our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors 
these claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
we may face costly intellectual property infringement claims 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties asserting that we are infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others or seeking indemnification against such alleged infringement 
for example  some end users of our products have notified us that they have received a claim of patent infringement from the jerome h 
lemelson foundation  alleging that their use of our machine vision products infringes certain patents issued to mr 
lemelson 
in addition  we have been notified that other end users of our adeptvision vme line and the predecessor line of multibus machine vision products have received letters from the lemelson foundation which refer to mr 
lemelson s patent portfolio and offer the end user a license to the particular patents 
as claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought of third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  that damages for infringement  and the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our end users have notified us that they may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses resulting from any claims make by the jerome h 
lemelson foundation 
we cannot predict the outcome of this or any similar litigation which may arise in the future 
litigation of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting guidance could result in delayed recognition of our revenues 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements or sab sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
in recent actions  the sec has further delayed the required implementation date which  for us  will be the fourth quarter of fiscal  retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year 
the sec has indicated that additional implementation guidance will be forthcoming in the form of frequently asked questions  however  such guidance has not been issued to date 
we cannot fully assess the impact of sab until the additional guidance from the sec is issued 
accordingly we are still in the process of assessing the impact of sab on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows based upon the most current information 
in certain situations  application of the new accounting could delay the recognition of revenue that might otherwise have been recognized in earlier periods 
as a result  our reported revenue may fluctuate more widely among fiscal periods in the future  and reported revenue for a particular fiscal period may not meet expectations 
risks related to our industry we face intense competition in the market for intelligent automation products 
the market for intelligent automation products is highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are o product functionality and reliability  o customer service  o price  o delivery  and o product features such as flexibility  programmability and ease of use 
we compete with a number of robot companies  motion control companies  machine vision companies and simulation software companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
in addition  we may in the future face competition from new entrants in one or more of our markets 
many of our competitors in the robot market are integrated manufacturers of products that produce robotics equipment internally for their own use and may also compete with our products for sales to other customers 
some of these large manufacturing companies have greater flexibility in pricing because they generate substantial unit volumes of robots for internal demand and may have access through their parent companies to large amounts of capital 
any of our competitors may seek to expand their presence in other markets in which we compete 
our current or potential competitors may develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by us or adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we may be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with our research  development  engineering  marketing and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat  so that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we expect that in the event the intelligent automation market expands  competition in the industry will intensify  as additional competitors enter our markets and current competitors expand their product lines 
increased competitive pressure could result in a loss of sales or market share  or cause us to lower prices for our products  any of which could harm our business 
we may not be able to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and new product development that characterize the intelligent automation industry 
the intelligent automation industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive depends greatly upon the technological quality of our products and processes compared to those of our competitors and our ability both to continue to develop new and enhanced products and to introduce those products at competitive prices and on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing and manufacturing new products or in enhancing our existing products on a timely basis or at all 
our new or enhanced products may not achieve market acceptance 
our failure to successfully select  develop and manufacture new products  or to timely enhance existing technologies and meet customers technical specifications for any new products or enhancements on a timely basis  or to successfully market new products  could harm our business 
if we cannot successfully develop and manufacture new products or meet specifications  our products could lose market share  our revenues and profits could decline  or we could experience operating losses 
new technology or product introductions by our competitors could also cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance for our existing products or force us to significantly reduce the prices of our existing products 
from time to time we have experienced delays in the introduction of  and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with  some of our products  and we may experience technical and manufacturing difficulties and delays in future introductions of new products and enhancements 
our failure to develop  manufacture and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenues from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transitions could harm our business 
our success in developing  introducing  selling and supporting new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including timely and efficient completion of hardware and software design and development  implementation of manufacturing processes and effective sales  marketing and customer service 
because of the complexity of our products  significant delays may occur between a product s initial introduction and commencement of volume production 
the development and commercialization of new products involve many difficulties  including o the identification of new product opportunities  o the retention and hiring of appropriate research and development personnel  o the determination of the product s technical specifications  o the successful completion of the development process  o the successful marketing of the product and the risk of having customers embrace new technological advances  and o additional customer service costs associated with supporting new product introductions or required for field upgrades 
for example  we are currently in the process of releasing our new micro and nano positioning mechanisms  nanomotion process modules  smart modules  standard platforms and semiconductor front ends 
these products include significant new networking  hardware and software technology 
the development of these products may not be completed in a timely manner  and these products may not achieve acceptance in the market 
the development of these products has required  and will require  that we expend significant financial and management resources 
if we are unable to continue to successfully develop these or other new products in response to customer requirements or technological changes  our business may be harmed 
if we fail to adequately invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we have limited resources to allocate to research and development and must allocate our resources among a wide variety of projects 
because of intense competition in our industry  the cost of failing to invest in strategic products is high 
if we fail to adequately invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete effectively in the intelligent automation markets in which we operate 
if we do not comply with environmental regulations  our business may be harmed 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  and disposal of certain hazardous substances used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations  and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
however  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to a variety of consequences that could harm our business  including o the imposition of substantial fines  o suspension of production  and o alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with environmental regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses 
our failure to control the use  disposal  removal  storage  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
the imposition of liabilities of this kind could harm our financial condition 
failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business 
we must comply with us department of commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other technologies outside the us any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our stock our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past 
between june  and june   the sales price of our common shares  as reported on the nasdaq national market  has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including o future announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  o the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  o litigation regarding proprietary rights or other matters  o change in analysts earnings estimates  o developments in the financial markets  o quarterly fluctuations in operating results  or o general conditions in the intelligent automation industry 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
