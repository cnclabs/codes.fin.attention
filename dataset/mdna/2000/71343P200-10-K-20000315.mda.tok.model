the vending and mass merchandising channels showed strong growth  as did the brands mountain dew  aquafina and dr pepper

the final consolidation of the operations in poland will be completed upon receipt of governmental approval to merge the companies 
improved results in the czech republic were principally due to higher volumes and increased contract sales

the increase was due principally to an increase in average outstanding net debt due to the acquisitions of domestic and central european territories from pepsico and related share repurchases 
other expense  net in includes a million charge recorded in the second quarter to reduce the book value of non operating real estate  as well as a million gain on the sale of the company s territories in marion  virginia  princeton  west virginia and the st 
petersburg area of russia

this comparison to is based on reported results  accordingly  the effects of the pepsico transaction are excluded 
sales sales increased by million  or percent  in to  million 
domestic sales increased by million  or percent  in to  million 
this increase reflects improvements in mix  pricing and volumes 
the average domestic net selling price per raw case rose percent and volume  in raw cases  grew percent over in ounce equivalent cases  volume  including foodservice  increased percent in to million cases 
sales growth was driven principally by the convenience gas station channel  the vending channel  and the fountain channel 
volume growth was led primarily by improved demand for the mountain dew  dr pepper  and lipton tea brands 
also contributing to the increased volume was double digit growth in the water brands aquafina and avalon  and the strong performance of pepsi brand product sales  which included the introduction of pepsi one and storm 
in  the company began reporting volume on an ounce equivalent basis  as well as raw cases  to better reflect the impact of package mix shift towards the ounce pet packages 
the ounce pet package growth benefited from a significant increase in vending machine placements during international sales decreased by million to million  principally reflecting a million decline in contract sales and the adverse effects of the economic crisis in russia

gross profit the company s consolidated gross profit increased by million  or percent  to million 
the consolidated gross profit margin increased to percent of sales in from percent in this increase principally reflected an increase in the international gross profit margin of percentage points to percent from percent in  due to higher margins in poland resulting from a product mix shift to more pet packaging 
however  partially offsetting this improvement was the economic downturn in russia  which slowed demand and lowered gross margins as the sales volume was insufficient to absorb fixed manufacturing overhead 
the domestic gross profit margin of percent was percentage points lower than  with higher costs for concentrate  fructose and packaging partially offset by increased net selling prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses increased by million  or percent  and represented percent of sales  compared with percent in this lower percentage reflected  among other items  increases in various forms of support from pepsico and the reduction in corporate headquarters management and staff

as of fiscal year end  accrued liabilities of million remained to cover deferred severance payments and certain employee benefits  which were paid during january  to the remaining employees 
see note  special charges  to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time the special charges were recorded in  the company anticipated that corporate expenses would be reduced by approximately million on an annualized basis  but indicated the estimated cost reductions would not be fully realized in the first year

international operating losses were million in compared to million in  which included million of special charges 
excluding these special charges  international operating losses increased by million 
this increase was caused primarily by the financial crisis in russia  partially offset by improved results in poland attributable primarily to increased sales of product in pet packages 
interest and other expenses net interest expense decreased million to million  primarily due to the repayment of debt using funds received from hussmann and midas immediately prior to the spin off transactions 
cash in excess of debt repayments was invested in short term instruments  resulting in higher interest income in compared with decreases in net interest expense were partially offset by the decrease in interest income on loans and advances to hussmann and midas  which were repaid in conjunction with the spin off transactions 
other expense  net  decreased million to million in the improvement was due  in part  to losses from asset sales and retirements included in and the elimination of preferred dividends see note  pepsi general non voting preferred stock  to the consolidated financial statements

also included in the sales of investments are miscellaneous land sales associated with the company s non operating real estate subsidiaries 
the company s total debt increased million to  million at fiscal year end  from million as of fiscal year end this increase is primarily attributable to the april  issuance of million of percent notes due in and million of percent notes due in  as well as commercial paper issued to fund the august  repayment of the million of notes payable to pepsico  which were assumed as part of the agreement with pepsico 
the company repurchased approximately million shares and million shares of its common stock for million and million in and  respectively

year system compliance the year yk issue related to computer applications being designed using only two digits  rather than four  to represent a year 
as a result  many suspected that computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by recognizing as the year rather than the year the yk activities  tests  remediations and upgrades that were performed by the company in advance of the year have proven successful in preventing business disruptions of any kind 
all of the company s information technology it and non it systems were yk compliant prior to the year as of march   the company is not aware of any business disruption or impact arising from yk non compliance by the company  its major suppliers and customers  or governmental entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company is subject to various market risks  including risks from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
commodity prices the risk from commodity price changes correlates to pepsi general s ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
in  the company began to use swap contracts to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of its aluminum requirements 
each contract hedges price fluctuations on a portion of the company s aluminum can requirements over a specified future six month period 
because of the high correlation between aluminum commodity prices and the company s contractual cost of aluminum cans  the company considers these hedges to be highly effective 
as of fiscal year end  the company has hedged a portion of its future domestic aluminum requirements 
interest rates during  the risk from changes in interest rates was not material to the company s operations because a significant portion of the company s debt issues were fixed rate obligations 
the company s floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month libor rate and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held by the company as of fiscal year end  a basis point percent change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on the company s annual interest expense related to its floating rate obligations 
in possible future issuances of debt  the company may be subject to additional floating rate interest exposure and may manage those exposures using interest rate swaps 
in  the company had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to overnight federal funds rates 
assuming a change of basis points in the rate of interest associated with the company s short term investments  interest income would have changed by approximately million 
currency exchange rates because the company operates international franchise territories  it is subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
the company currently does not hedge the translation risks of investments in its international operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
non us operations represent less than percent of the company s total operations 
changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the results of the international operations from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by percent in  the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category 
the economy in russia was considered highly inflationary for accounting purposes with all transactions being recorded at historical costs in us dollars 
all gains and losses due to foreign exchange transactions from the russian operations  which were sold in the first quarter of  are included in the consolidated results of operations
