item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the company s historical consolidated financial position at december   and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview a significant portion of the company s proved oil and gas reserves are concentrated in the trend 
oil and gas production in the trend is generally characterized by a high initial production rate  followed by a steep rate of decline 
in order to maintain its oil and gas reserve base  production levels and cash flow from operations  the company needs to maintain or increase its level of drilling activity and achieve comparable or improved results from such activities 
however  low oil prices caused the company to temporarily suspend trend drilling activities from april through september  resulting in significant declines in oil production from levels 
since  the company has initiated several exploratory projects designed to reduce its dependence on trend drilling for future production and reserve growth 
these new areas include the company s cotton valley pinnacle reef exploratory project  which targets deep gas structures in the vicinity of its core properties in east central texas  as well as other exploratory projects in south texas  louisiana and mississippi  and emphasize the development of long life gas reserves 
during  the company devoted a substantial portion of its capital expenditures to these new areas 
in the aggregate  exploratory drilling activities accounted for about of the company s  mboe of proved reserves added through extensions and discoveries during the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties  whereby costs of productive wells  developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized and amortized using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
costs of unproved properties are initially capitalized 
those properties with significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to expense 
the amount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate groups based on the company s historical experience  acquisition dates and average lease terms 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs  including the cost of stratigraphic test wells  are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful

compared to revenues oil and gas sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a decline in oil production  offset in part by an increase in the company s average oil price net of hedging transactions 
the decline in oil production was caused primarily by the suspension of trend drilling activities from april through september in response to low oil prices 
gas production from new wells  primarily attributable to the cotton valley pinnacle reef area  was offset by the loss of production from two gas properties sold in the company s average price per barrel of oil increased after giving effect to an 
per barrel loss on hedging activities in as compared to a per barrel gain in average gas prices were consistent after giving effect to a 
per mcf hedging loss in as compared to a 
mcf gain in costs and expenses lease operations expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a combination of cost reduction measures implemented by the company  beginning in the fourth quarter of  and lower costs attributable to the sale of two gas properties in oil and gas production on a boe basis decreased during the current period  causing a decrease in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in exploration costs decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the charge off during the period of gross net exploratory dry holes totaling million and million of unproved property impairments  as compared to only gross net exploratory dry holes totaling million and million of unproved property impairments during because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a decrease in the company s average depletion rate per boe 
the lower depletion rate was attributable to the effects of higher oil and gas prices on estimated quantities of proved reserves combined with a decline in oil and gas production on a boe basis 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per boe was in compared to in general and administrative g a expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to certain cost reduction measures initiated in december these cost reduction measures  consisting primarily of personnel layoffs and salary reductions  were originally expected to achieve a annual savings 
however  many of these measures were reversed during the last half of due to an increase in drilling activity prompted by higher product prices 
the company recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during the fourth quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets sfas  as compared to an  provision in the provision applied to certain oil and gas properties in east central texas  south texas  the texas gulf coast  louisiana  and mississippi and was caused primarily by a decline in forecasted oil and gas prices  while the provision related to a minor value property 
interest expense and other interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to a combination of lower capitalized interest and higher average levels of indebtedness on the company s secured bank credit facility the credit facility 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility during was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees  during the and periods was 
capitalized interest was  less during the period due to a decrease in unproved acreage 
gain on sales of property and equipment increased from  in to million in the gain resulted primarily from the sale of the company s interests in eight non operated oil and gas wells located in matagorda county  texas  and its interests in the jalmat field located in lea county  new mexico 
compared to revenues oil and gas sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower oil prices 
the company s average oil price during the current period declined after giving effect to a per barrel gain on hedging activities 
excluding hedging transactions  the company s average price per barrel of oil declined from in to in although oil production for decreased as compared to  several factors related to the current depressed levels of oil prices had a negative impact on production 
in april  the company suspended its trend drilling program until oil prices improve and stabilize 
the company also implemented an oil curtailment strategy during which resulted in a decrease of approximately  barrels of oil production during the year 
all of the company s gas discoveries in were either completed late in the year or are currently waiting on pipeline connections 
accordingly  production from new wells has not been sufficient to offset the recent decline in oil production attributable to the suspension of trend drilling 
furthermore  until these wells and other exploratory projects establish and sustain commercial levels of production  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to offset the decline in production 
costs and expenses lease operations expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower production taxes resulting from a significant decline in oil prices 
oil and gas production on a boe basis decreased during the current period  causing a decrease in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in exploration costs doubled from million in to million in due primarily to the charge off of gross net exploratory dry holes during the period totaling million and million of unproved property impairments 
these charges were offset in part by a million reduction in seismic costs from to because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
dd a expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in the company s average depletion rate per boe attributable to the effects of lower oil and gas prices on estimated quantities of proved reserves 
this increase in the average depletion rate was substantially offset by an decline in oil and gas production on a boe basis 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per boe was in compared to in g a expenses were relatively constant from to however  beginning in december  the company implemented certain cost reduction measures  consisting primarily of personnel layoffs and salary reductions  in order to reduce overhead and conserve financial resources 
through these efforts  the company expects to reduce g a expenses in by approximately on an annualized basis 
the company recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during the fourth quarter of in accordance with sfas  as compared to a  provision in the provision applied to certain oil and gas properties in east central texas  south texas  the texas gulf coast  louisiana  and mississippi and was caused primarily by a decline in forecasted oil and gas prices 
interest expense and other interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher average levels of indebtedness on the company s secured bank credit facility the credit facility  offset in part by an increase in capitalized interest and slightly lower average interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility during was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees  during the period was compared to in capitalized interest was  higher during the period due to a significant increase in unproved acreage 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary financial resource is its oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  the banks establish a borrowing base  as derived from the estimated value of the company s oil and gas properties  against which the company may borrow funds as needed to supplement its internally generated cash flow as a source of financing for its capital expenditure program 
product prices  over which the company has very limited control  have a significant impact on such estimated value and thereby on the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility 
within the confines of product pricing  the company must be able to find and develop or acquire oil and gas reserves in a cost effective manner in order to generate sufficient financial resources through internal means to complete the financing of its capital expenditure program 
the following discussion sets forth the company s current plans for capital expenditures in  and the expected capital resources needed to finance such plans 
capital expenditures the company plans to spend million on exploration and development activities during  including million in the trend  million on the cotton valley exploratory project  million on various exploratory prospects in louisiana and million on other projects 
see business drilling  exploration and production activities 
the company may increase or decrease its planned activities for  depending upon drilling results  product prices  the availability of capital resources  and other factors affecting the economic viability of such activities 
capital resources credit facility the credit facility provides for a revolving loan facility in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the borrowing base  as established by the banks  or that portion of the borrowing base determined by the company to be the elected borrowing limit 
at december   the borrowing base was million and the outstanding advances were million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination at any time  but at least semi annually  and is made at the discretion of the banks 
if the redetermined borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  the company will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
working capital and cash flow during  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million  received million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  repaid million of indebtedness on the credit facility and spent million on capital expenditures 
the company s working capital deficit decreased from million at december  to million at december  at december   the company classified million of its outstanding indebtedness on the credit facility as a current liability based on the required levels of repayments during in november  the banks redetermined the borrowing base and did not require any mandatory principal repayments 
the company also reported million of net book values on properties held for resale as current assets as of december   while no properties were classified as current assets as of december  the company believes that the funds available under the credit facility and cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund the company s operations and projected capital and exploratory expenditures during however  because future cash flows and the availability of borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s exploratory and development activities 
inflation although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations during information systems for the year historically  certain computer software systems  as well as certain hardware containing embedded chip technology  such as microcontrollers and microprocessors  were designed to utilize a two digit date field and consequently  they may not have been able to properly recognize dates in the year this could have resulted in system failures 
the company relies on its computer based management information systems  as well as embedded technology  to operate instruments and equipment in conducting its day to day business activities 
certain of these computer based programs and embedded technology may not have been designed to function properly with respect to the application of dating systems relating to the year in response  the company developed a year plan in and established an internal group to identify and assess potential areas of risk and to make any required modifications to its computer systems and equipment used in oil and gas exploration  production  gathering and gas processing activities 
the year plan was comprised of various phases  including assessment  remediation  testing and contingency plan development 
by early  the company s inventory of computer hardware and software was substantially year compliant 
the programming modifications for the oil and gas accounting and production systems were completed by the software vendor in and were installed and tested by the company in november the company also uses monitor and control equipment with embedded chip technology in its production and gas processing operations 
the various systems were reviewed in conjunction with the overall year plan and were found to be year compliant based on manufacturers representations 
in  the company also began to monitor the compliance efforts of purchasers  vendors  contractors and other third parties third party providers with whom it does business and whose computer based systems and or embedded technology equipment interface with those of the company to ensure that operations would not be adversely affected by the year compliance problems of others 
the company has experienced no computer systems or equipment failures related to the arrival of the year all systems and equipment have continued to be operational  and the company has no reason to believe that any of its systems and equipment are not year compliant 
furthermore  the company is not aware of any year compliance problems of third party providers which have adversely affected  or which may in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to conduct business with such third party providers 
the costs to implement the year plan were nominal since the primary area for remediation involved software covered by a maintenance agreement 
the company believes that the year plan has been successfully completed and  except for routine monitoring of its computer systems and equipment  does not plan to take any further action in regards to year issues 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the company s business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe the company s strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that the company can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on the company s ability to obtain capital for its exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on the company s levels of oil and gas production  a change in the price per bbl of oil and a 
change in the price per mcf of gas would result in an aggregate change in gross revenues of approximately million 
during and continuing into  the oil and gas industry operated in a depressed commodity price environment 
oil prices during the first quarter of fell to their lowest levels in history when adjusted for inflation 
since then  oil prices have steadily improved  and in march  peaked at over per barrel on the nymex 
gas prices have also improved since march  but like the oil markets  remain very volatile 
from time to time  the company has utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to mitigate its exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
the company uses various financial instruments  such as swaps and collars  whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the nymex or certain other indices 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays the counterparty based on the difference 
the instruments utilized by the company differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation which requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
except for a floor of per barrel on  barrels of oil production from january through june  the company did not have any significant hedging arrangements in place for however  in january  the company entered into swap arrangements covering  mmbtu of its gas production from february through may at an average price of per mmbtu 
this position was subsequently terminated at an aggregate loss of approximately  also in february  the company entered into swap arrangements covering  barrels of its oil production from july through december and from april through october at an average price of per barrel ranging from a high of per barrel in july to a low of in october  and entered into a collar arrangement covering  barrels of its oil production from january through march at an average floor price of per barrel and an average ceiling price of per barrel 
interest rates all of the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to the credit facility 
see capital resources 
the company may designate borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flow 
although various financial instruments are available to hedge the effects of changes in interest rates  the company does not consider the risk to be significant and has not entered into any interest rate hedging transactions 
based on the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  of million  a change in interest rates of basis points would affect future annual interest payments by approximately
