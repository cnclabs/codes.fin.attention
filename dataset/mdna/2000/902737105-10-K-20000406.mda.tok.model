in some cases  the states are mandated by federal law to functionally regulate insurance entities in these areas 
the company is unable to predict when or whether any additional federal or state proposals  or some combination thereof  will be enacted or  if enacted  the likely impact on the company 
it is possible  however  that the enactment of such additional health care reform legislation could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has been proactively involved in an advocacy role concerning such regulatory initiatives and is in a position to evaluate and recommend the company s position with respect to such initiatives 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was for compared to for and for the   and effective rate varied from the federal tax rate of primarily due to the small life insurance company deduction allowed for certain insurance subsidiaries of the company along with certain tax credits and the change in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets 
in  no tax benefit was recognized for certain operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company has recognized a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
liquidity and capital resources general historically  the company s primary sources of cash have been premium revenues from policies issued  investment income  fees and other income  deposits to fund the credit card receivables  and borrowings to fund student loans 
the primary uses of cash have been payments for benefits  claims and commissions under those policies  operating expenses and the funding of credit card receivables and student loans 
net cash used in operations totaled approximately million in net cash provided from operations totaled million and in and  respectively 
the company s insurance subsidiaries invest a substantial portion of these funds  pending payment of the subsidiaries pro rata share of future benefits and claims 
the operating losses at united creditserv have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity and cash flow of the company 
since december   uici through united creditserv has contributed to ucnb as capital an aggregate of million in cash  including additional cash in the amount of million contributed on march  uici has funded these cash contributions with the proceeds of sale of investment securities  regular cash dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries and cash on hand 
uici is a holding company  the principal assets of which are its investments in its separate operating subsidiaries  including its regulated insurance subsidiaries 
the holding company s ability to fund its cash requirements is largely dependent upon its ability to access cash  by means of dividends or other means  from its subsidiaries 
dividends paid by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries in any year are restricted by the laws of the state of such subsidiaries domicile 
inability to access cash from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity and capital resources 
in connection with the company s designation of united creditserv as a discontinued operation  the company has recorded in a loss in the amount of million  which represents its current estimate of ultimate loss upon disposal for financial reporting purposes 
as part of its plan to exit from the credit card business on or before december  and in accordance with the terms of the consent order issued by the occ  the company also expects that ucnb will enter into a capital plan designed to meet federal bank regulatory requirements 
based on current projections  the company believes that its exit from the credit card business will require the holding company to generate additional cash in the amount of approximately million to fund future operating losses of the credit card business  including approximately million which will be required to be contributed as additional capital to ucnb pursuant to the capital plan 
in addition  through december  the holding company will have additional cash requirements in the amount of approximately million  of which million represents a mandatory principal payment owing on its bank credit facility in july the company currently anticipates that these cash requirements at the holding company level will be funded by cash on hand million at april   possible sales of certain of its operating subsidiaries  sales of investment securities  proceeds from refinancing of indebtedness  proceeds from the issuance by the holding company of debt and or equity securities  or regular dividends from its regulated insurance subsidiaries  if required 
it is likely that the payment of dividends from its regulated insurance subsidiaries will adversely affect the insurance subsidiaries claims paying and am best ratings 
nonetheless  the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries  without prior approval of the state regulatory authorities  could currently pay aggregate dividends to the holding company in the amount of approximately million and an additional million after december  there can be no assurance that the cash requirements at the holding company level will not exceed current estimates  or that the holding company will be able to raise sufficient cash to fund cash requirements on a timely basis 
united creditserv ucnb s unsecuritized net credit card receivables increased from million at december  to million at december   which growth was funded with the proceeds of deposits at ucnb

ucnb is subject to risk based capital guidelines adopted by the occ 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to several weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under current guidelines  in order to be considered adequately capitalized  institutions are required to maintain a minimum total risk based capital ratio total tier and tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and a tier risk based capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
the occ has also established guidelines prescribing a minimum leverage ratio tier capital to adjusted total assets as specified in the guidelines of for institutions that meet certain criteria  including the requirement that they have the highest regulatory rating  and a minimum of for institutions that do not meet the criteria 
the occ may  however  set higher capital requirements when an institution s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december  giving effect to all capital contributions made subsequent to december   ucnb had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of 
the board of directors of ucnb has established a policy of maintaining a tier i leverage ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of not less than 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia expanded the powers of federal bank regulatory authorities to take corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fdicia established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under regulations adopted by the occ  an institution is generally considered to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and  generally  a leverage ratio of or greater  and undercapitalized if it does not meet any of the adequately capitalized tests 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio under and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity as defined in the regulations to total assets that is equal to or less than 
an adequately capitalized institution is permitted to accept brokered deposits only if it receives a waiver from the fdic and pays interest on deposits at a rate that is not more than basis points higher than the prevailing rate in its market 
undercapitalized institutions cannot accept brokered deposits  are subject to growth limitations and must submit a capital restoration plan 
significantly undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
a liquidity and capital assurances agreement  dated may   between uici and ucnb provides that  upon demand by ucnb  uici will purchase certificates of deposit issued by ucnb to assure sufficient liquidity to meet ucnb s funding demands and will contribute capital to ucnb sufficient for ucnb to comply with its stated policy of maintaining a total tier i and tier ii risk based capital ratio of at least 
in accordance with the terms of the consent order  on march   ucnb submitted to the occ for its review and approval a capital plan the proposed capital plan 
the proposed capital plan contemplates the orderly disposition of united creditserv s ownership interest in ucnb or the liquidation of ucnb  the payment of all of ucnb s insured deposits and satisfaction of all other ucnb liabilities  and the maintenance of minimum capital ratios 
the proposed capital plan provides that united creditserv will dispose of its interest in ucnb or ucnb will dispose of all of its assets on or before december  the plan period 
to support its implementation  the proposed capital plan further contemplates that a uici  united creditserv and uici s principal shareholder will provide financial support to ucnb and deliver collateral to ucnb to secure its obligations to provide such financial support and b ucnb will be able to access the brokered deposit market on a limited basis 
under the proposed capital plan  it is currently expected that uici will be required to contribute an additional million to the capital of ucnb during the plan period 
the proposed capital plan is expressly subject to the review and approval of the occ and the fdic 
there can be no assurance that the occ or the fdic will approve the proposed capital plan in its current form 
if the occ and or fdic fails to approve the proposed capital plan or some mutually acceptable alternative plan  ucnb could be required to liquidate its assets on a short term basis and the company could be required to fund the resulting losses immediately 
such a requirement would have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in the event that the occ determines that the proposed capital plan does not comply with the terms of the consent order  the occ may take a number of actions  including directing that a new capital plan be submitted  seeking an order from a federal district court directing compliance with the consent order  or seeking the assessment of civil money penalties

investments general 
the company has an investment committee that monitors the investment portfolio of the company and its subsidiaries 
the investment committee receives investment management services from external professionals 
investments are selected based upon the parameters established in the company s investment policies 
emphasis is given to the selection of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
maturities or liquidity characteristics of the securities are managed by continually structuring the duration of the investment portfolio to be consistent with the duration of the policy liabilities 
consistent with regulatory requirements and internal guidelines  the company invests in a range of assets  but limits its investments in certain classes of assets  and limits its exposure to certain industries and to single issuers 
shown below are the company s investments by category december  december  of total of total carrying carrying carrying carrying amount value amount value in thousands securities available for sale fixed maturities  at fair value cost     equity securities  at fair value cost     mortgage and collateral loans   policy loans   investment in unconsolidated subsidiary   short term investments   total investments   investment accounting policies 
the company has classified its entire fixed maturity portfolio as available for sale 
this classification requires the portfolio to be carried at fair value with the resulting unrealized gains or losses  net of applicable income taxes  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as a result  fluctuations in interest rates will result in increases or decreases to the company s stockholders equity 
fixed maturity securities 
fixed maturity securities accounted for of the company s total investments at december  fixed maturity securities consisted of the following december  of total carrying carrying value value in thousands us treasury and us government agency us  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies and authorities  other mortgage and asset backed securities  included in the fixed maturity portfolio is a concentration of mortgage backed securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed pass throughs 
to limit its credit risk  the company invests in mortgage backed securities which are rated investment grade by the public rating agencies 
the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio is a conservatively structured portfolio that is concentrated in the less volatile tranches  in the form of planned amortization classes  sequential payment and commercial mortgage backed securities

in recent years  inflation in the costs of medical care covered by such insurance has exceeded the general rate of inflation 
under major hospital insurance coverage  established ceilings for covered expenses limit the impact of inflation on the amount of claims paid 
under catastrophic hospital expense plans and preferred provider contracts  covered expenses are generally limited only by a maximum lifetime benefit and a maximum lifetime benefit per accident or sickness 
thus  inflation may have a significantly greater impact on the amount of claims paid under catastrophic hospital expense and preferred provider plans as compared to claims under major hospital coverage 
as a result  trends in health care costs must be monitored and rates adjusted accordingly 
under the health insurance policies issued in the self employed market  the primary insurer generally has the right to increase rates upon days written notice and subject to regulatory approval in most cases 
the annuity and universal life type policies issued directly and assumed by the company are significantly impacted by inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments and the amount of interest that policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
the interest rate risk taken in the investment portfolio is managed relative to the duration of the liabilities 
the company s investment portfolio consists mainly of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in the primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in the future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
profitability of the student loans is affected by the spreads between the interest yield on the student loans and the cost of the funds borrowed under the various credit facilities 
although the interest rates on the student loans and the interest rate on the credit facilities are variable  the interest earned uses the day t bill as the base rate while the base rate on the credit facilities is libor 
united creditserv s operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of interest earned on the credit cards and the amount of the interest paid on the time deposits 
the maturity of the time deposits is less than one year 
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term is defined as a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
duration on invested assets is adjusted to call  put and interest rate reset features 
the sensitivity analysis model produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in managing its market risk
