overview this discussion analyzes our operations for the full years of   and during and we experienced a number of significant changes that resulted in a marked increase in our total assets  revenues  and expenses  and significant changes in our capital and operating structure 
in reading this discussion  it might help if you keep certain key events and general trends in mind o our apartment portfolio has grown dramatically from five apartment communities containing  units in november  to apartment communities containing  units in january o we converted to an upreit structure in december we utilized this structure to complete nine of our ten apartment community acquisitions in the last three years by issuing approximately million operating partnership units 
minority owners now represent approximately ownership of the operating partnership 
o we completed a common stock offering of million shares of our common stock in december net proceeds of this offering were million 
o in december  we established a share buy back program that authorized the repurchase and retirement of up to  shares of our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million 
we receive revenue from two principal sources apartment rents and restaurant rents 
in addition  we have other income that consists primarily of interest income and equity income from our unconsolidated subsidiary 
as a result of our apartment acquisitions  our total revenue has increased significantly 
in addition  the percentage of our total revenue that comes from apartment rental income has increased significantly 
however  restaurant rental income remains significant to our cash flow  since our operating expenses related to restaurants are insignificant to our operations 
results of operations compared to net income net income available to common shareholders in was million  a decrease of compared to earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by  while non cash charges for depreciation and amortization increased by  in compared to revenues total revenue for was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily attributable to apartment community acquisitions in and january apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income for was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily the result of apartment community acquisitions 
average economic occupancy for all apartments was in and in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for all apartments was in and in on a same units basis  rental income for apartments owned throughout both years increased 
average economic occupancy for these units was for and in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for these units was in and in throughout  we experienced some weakness in the majority of our apartment markets 
this weakness appears to be the result of new apartment construction and robust home sales 
while we have been able to maintain or improve high occupancy levels  we have not been able to achieve target rental rates 
as a result  apartment rental income was lower in than expected 
overall  we do not expect any significant improvement in our apartment markets in in light of this  we will continue to emphasize occupancy as a means of maximizing cash flow from our apartment communities 
we will also strive to maintain our competitive position by keeping the apartment communities in an excellent state of repair and by making selective improvements 
we believe that we have good properties in excellent locations  and that we are well positioned to compete effectively in our markets 
restaurant rental income for was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income was the minimum rent for both and the decline in rental income was the result of the sale of three restaurants in under the lease  restaurant rental payments are the greater of a specified minimum rent or of food sales 
prior to the sale of the three restaurants in  the minimum rent was  per year  or  per month 
with the sale of the three restaurants  the new minimum rent is  per year  or  per month beginning june excluding the three restaurants that were sold during  restaurant food sales declined for the year 
for rent payments based on percentage rent to resume  sales would have to increase over levels 
interest and other income decreased by to  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  reduction in interest income due to repayment in february of million in principal on a note receivable from a joint venture partnership 
our interest in the net income of the management company was  in compared to  in we do not expect the operations of the management company to have a significant effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows in future periods 
expenses total expenses for were million  an increase of over this increase is primarily due to apartment community acquisitions in and early apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of over this increase reflects the impact of apartment acquisitions in and early as well as higher operating costs 
apartment operations expense totaled of related rental income in compared to in on a same units basis  operations expense for apartments owned throughout both years increased in as compared to for these units  apartment operations expense totaled of related income compared to in apartment operations expenses were generally in line with management s expectations 
the increase in apartment operations expense as a percent of related income is primarily attributable to shortfalls in rental income 
increases in on site personnel compensation  taxes and insurance further increased apartment operations expense as a percent of related income 
operating expenses for restaurant properties are insignificant because the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
the increases in depreciation and amortization expense are primarily attributable to the addition of apartment communities 
depreciation expense was million in  an increase of compared to for apartment communities owned throughout both years  depreciation expense increased  reflecting the impact of additions and replacements at those communities 
administrative expense was million in  a increase over we include our apartment property management costs as well as corporate expenses in this line item 
the increase in administrative costs is generally attributable to additional management and administrative staff and overhead costs corresponding to the addition of apartment communities 
in addition  legal and professional fees expense totaled  in compared to  in  reflecting the increased complexity and costs associated with administration of our upreit structure 
we expect that administrative costs will continue to increase  but at a slower rate  as and when we acquire additional apartment communities 
interest expense was million in  an increase of over this increase reflects the effect of increased debt related to apartment acquisitions in and early we were able to obtain favorable rates  fixed at rates ranging from to on new debt issues in the second half of  which resulted in weighted average interest rates of in compared to in compared to net income net income available to common shareholders in was million  an increase of over earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by  while non cash charges for depreciation and amortization increased by  in compared to revenues total revenue for was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily attributable to apartment community acquisitions in and apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income for was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily the result of apartment community acquisitions

for  sales at our restaurant properties totaled million  a decrease of compared to interest and other income increased by to  in as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to  interest and fees compared to  in earned on a note receivable from a joint venture partnership 
our interest in the net income of the management company decreased to  in compared to  in this decrease reflects the effect of the sale of two managed properties in the first quarter of and the loss of management fees from woods edge and oak hollow 
the management company fee managed these communities before we acquired them 
expenses total expenses for were million  an increase of over this increase was primarily due to apartment community acquisitions in and apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of over this increase reflects the impact of apartment acquisitions in and  along with an overall increase in apartment operations expense 
apartment operations expense totaled of related income in compared to in on a same units basis  apartment operations expense for apartments owned in both years increased by in compared to for these units  apartment operations expense totaled of related income in compared to in during we experienced increased costs associated with attracting and retaining residents in an increasingly competitive apartment market 
we also experienced significant increases in property insurance premiums effective november as a result of a fire loss 
in addition  we experienced increased payroll costs in  primarily due to increased maintenance labor rates 
operating expenses for restaurant properties were insignificant because of the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement that requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
depreciation expense was million in  an increase of over the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to apartment community acquisitions

interest expense was million in  an increase of over the increased expense in reflects the effect of debt issued related to apartment acquisitions  offset by the significant impact of retirements of higher rate debt 
weighted average interest rates were in compared to in funds from operations funds from operations and funds available for distribution are defined in footnote on page we calculated funds from operations as follows all amounts in thousands income before minority interest and extraordinary item    depreciation    amortization of management intangible non recurring equity income items funds from operations before minority interest in operating partnership    a reconciliation of funds from operations to funds available for distribution follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations before minority interest in operating partnership    amortization of loan costs recurring capital expenditures  non recurring equity income items funds available for distribution    a further reconciliation of funds from operations of the operating partnership to basic funds from operations available to common shareholders follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations before minority interest in operating partnership    minority interest in funds from operations   basic funds from operations available to common shareholders    other information about our historical cash flows follows all amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    dividends and distributions paid to shareholders    minority unitholders in operating partnership   scheduled debt principal payments non recurring capital expenditures acquisition improvements and replacements other apartment property improvements weighted average common shares outstanding    weighted average operating partnership minority units outstanding   the additions of apartment communities have more than offset the decline in restaurant rental income  producing increases in funds from operations

recurring capital expenditures averaged per unit in  per unit in  and per unit in capital resources and liquidity capital resources in january  we acquired an apartment community for a total cost of approximately million 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we made cash payments totaling approximately million and assumed long term debt and related liabilities totaling million 
we did not issue any common stock or operating partnership units in conjunction with this transaction 
we financed this acquisition through draws on our line of credit that is secured by a deed of trust on our restaurant properties 
in december  we established a share buy back program that authorized the repurchase and retirement of up to  shares of our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
in early  we repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately  during we made draws totaling million on our line of credit that is secured by our restaurant properties 
we applied these funds toward our apartment acquisition  the buyback of common stock  and to retire a million note payable to an affiliate 
during we also entered into a line of credit arrangement totaling million that is secured by a deed of trust on latitudes apartments 
we applied a million draw against this line of credit to retire a fixed rate deed of trust loan secured by latitudes apartments 
during june through september  we acquired five apartment communities for a total cost of approximately million 
in conjunction with these acquisitions  we issued operating partnership units with an imputed value of approximately million 
we financed these acquisitions through assumption or issue of fixed rate deed of trust loans totaling million and draws on our line of credit totaling million 
in december  we acquired four apartment communities for a total cost of approximately million 
in conjunction with these acquisitions  we issued operating partnership units with an imputed value of approximately million 
we financed these acquisitions with fixed rate deed of trust loans totaling million and short term borrowings 
in december and january  we issued million shares of our common stock through a common stock offering 
we applied the approximately million net proceeds of the offering to retire or pay down existing debt 
during we issued  shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
during and  we issued  shares of our common stock through the drip plan 
in addition  during and  we issued  shares of our common stock to affiliates for additional consideration and to retire debt related to previous acquisitions 
during  and  we issued million operating partnership units in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment communities 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement for a community that is currently under construction  we will issue up to  units 
holders of operating partnership units will generally be able to redeem their units for cash or  at our option  for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis after one year following issuance 
we intend to pursue our growth strategy through the utilization of our flexible capital structure 
this may include the issuance of operating partnership units  common stock and or preferred stock  additional debt  and joint venture investments 
we may use our lines of credit or fixed rate  long term debt to acquire apartment communities 
cash flows and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities were million in  compared to million in and million in these increases reflect our growth in apartment operations 
investing and financing activities focused primarily on apartment acquisitions and capital expenditures at apartment communities  along with payments of dividends and distributions 
we capitalize expenditures to acquire new assets  to materially enhance the value of existing assets  or to substantially extend the useful life of existing assets 
all floor covering  appliance  and hvac replacements  as well as major capital maintenance expenditures are capitalized 
we have generally funded additions to apartment properties from cash provided by operating activities and proceeds of common stock issued through our drip plan 
we paid dividends of per share per quarter in each quarter of  and our dividend payout ratio the ratio of dividends paid to funds from operations was in  in  and in we intend to pay dividends quarterly  expect that these dividends will substantially exceed the distribution requirement for reits  and anticipate that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
short and long term liquidity requirements at december   total long term debt was million  including million of notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was at december   and at december  a fluctuation in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately  a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in the notes to the financial statements in this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of o our line of credit secured by deeds of trust and assignment of rents of restaurants  due january up to million  million outstanding at december   o our line of credit secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of an apartment community  due december up to million  million outstanding at december  
we continue to produce sufficient cash flow to fund our regular dividend 
however  any number of unforeseen events  or a combination of such events for example  a substantial decline in apartment operations  a substantial increase in short term interest rates  or the sale of the restaurant properties or other assets  might necessitate a reduction in the current dividend 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
we believe that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet the reit operating requirements in both the short and the long term 
we anticipate funding our future acquisition activities primarily by using short term credit facilities as an interim measure  to be replaced by funds from equity offerings  long term debt  or joint venture investments 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities 
we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we received approximately of our revenue in  compared to in and in  from enterprises payment of rent for the use of our restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
over time  we expect that restaurant rental income will continue to represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
however  we expect that restaurant rent will exceed of our revenue in under our current line of credit agreement  enterprises has the right to purchase  under specified terms  up to four additional restaurants deemed to be non economic for no less than net carrying value 
the annual minimum rent would be reduced by approximately  for each restaurant 
we would receive sale proceeds of the greater of net carrying value or fair value 
as of december   the average net book value of the restaurant properties was approximately  we would most likely apply sale proceeds to reduce outstanding debt on our line of credit 
in march  we received notification of enterprises intention to purchase one additional restaurant property effective june  enterprises is a privately owned company with total assets exceeding million and net equity of approximately million 
enterprises principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants 
we have had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and have reviewed enterprises financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and projections 
we believe that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease as well as its general corporate operating needs 
inflation we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at our apartment properties are short term in nature 
none are longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters phase i environmental studies performed on the apartment communities when we acquired each of them did not identify any problems that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified us for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties under the master lease 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended by statement no 
 must be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement will require the recognition of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
year issue the year issue refers to the inability of certain computer systems to accurately store and use dates after we experienced no problems or disruption of operations in the rollover from to the year to date there has been no indication of any significant year issue with regard to our operations or computer information system

at december   total long term debt was million  including million notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates
