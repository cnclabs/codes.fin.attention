item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the process segment experienced a significant decline in new orders received due largely to industry consolidations  fixed asset rationalizations  softness in the industrial gas market and the asian economic situation 
new orders in this segment were million compared with million in the distribution segment continued at a steady pace in and was helped by the mve acquisition  as new orders in were million compared with in the applications segment was significantly enhanced by the addition of mve and strong mri orders  growing from million in orders for to million in the significant decline in the company s backlog was also due to the process segment  which had backlog of million at december  the distribution and applications segments had backlog of million and million  respectively  at december  operating results the following table sets forth the percentage relationship each line item in the company s statements of operations represents to sales

the acquisitions of mve on april  and of northcoast on march  contributed million in incremental sales to the year  improving the sales of both the distribution and applications segments

gross profit margin for was percent versus percent for the significant decline in gross profit margin occurred primarily in the process segment  where gross profit margin declined approximately percentage points 
pricing pressure in this segment was intense  as the market for process equipment was very competitive due to industry consolidations  fixed asset rationalizations and the overall softness in the industrial gas market

net interest expense for was million compared with  for  reflecting interest on funds borrowed to finance the mve acquisition 
the effective income tax rate for was percent compared with percent for the change in the effective income tax rate is due to the loss incurred in offset by non deductible ipr d expense and goodwill amortization

the gross margin increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in gross margin came from the process segment 
the most dramatic improvement came as a result of increased volume and price in the brazed aluminum heat exchanger market
