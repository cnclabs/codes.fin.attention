 revenue recognition in financial statements  on december  this sab provides additional guidance on the accounting for revenue recognition  including both broad conceptual discussions as well as certain industry specific guidance 
the new guidance that is most likely to have a potential impact on the company concerns customer acceptance and installation terms 
the company is in the process of accumulating the information necessary to quantify the potential impact of this new guidance 
the guidance is effective for the first quarter of fiscal and would be adopted by recording the effect of any prior revenue transactions affected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  dividends in january  the company s board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of cents per share  resulting in an annual rate of cents per share for fiscal environmental the company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company locations and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
the company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the company s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
the company has accrued million as of january   representing management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
such amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where the company has been named a prp  management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
the company expects that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five years 
as assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred  the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
the year issue the following year statements constitute a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year readiness and disclosure act of the operations of the company rely on various computer technologies which  as is common to most corporations  may be affected by what is commonly referred to as the year yk issue 
the yk issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment and software  as well as devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive  may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations and normal business activities 
as of january   the company did not experience a material effect on its business as a result of the yk issue 
the financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year ended january  were not materially impacted by the yk issue

the company did not experience any material yk legal claims due to its inability to perform contractual responsibilities or from failure of its products 
as part of its yk program  the company assessed the effect on the company of the yk compliance of its significant customers  vendors  suppliers  raw materials suppliers  primary service suppliers  and financial institutions 
the company has followed a strategy of identification of risks  risk assessment  continuous material third party monitoring and evaluation  and contingency planning 
the company did not use or engage outside firms for the purpose of independent verification and validation of the reliability of third party risks assessed and cost estimates related thereto under the company s yk program 
although the company has reviewed the yk compliance of a substantial number of its material third parties  it is currently unable to predict the final readiness of all of its material third parties 
certain of the company s products are used in conjunction with products of other companies in applications that may be critical to the operations of its customers 
any company product s yk non compliance  whether standing alone or used in conjunction with the products of other companies  may expose the company to claims from its customers  material third parties or others  and could impair market acceptance of the company s products or services  increase service and warranty costs  or result in payment of damages  which in turn could materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial position of the company 
while the company expects such material third parties to address the yk issue based on the representations made by such third parties to the company  it cannot guarantee that these systems have been made yk compliant or will be made yk compliant in a timely manner and cannot guarantee that it will not experience a material adverse effect as a result of such non compliance 
the costs incurred by the company through january  to address the yk issue totaled approximately million 
the costs include those incurred by the company s technical services segment  which was divested in august these amounts include the costs to lease  purchase or expense new software and equipment needed to achieve year compliance and enhance existing systems  as well as internal costs related to this effort 
amounts expended for the company s yk program were outside of and incremental to the company s it budget for ongoing operational projects 
with the exception of new hardware or software which qualify for capitalization under generally accepted accounting principles  the company expensed all costs associated with the yk program 
funding requirements for the company s yk program activities during fiscal are not expected to be significant and have been incorporated into the company s capital and operating plans 
the company will utilize cash and equivalents and cash flows from operations to fund remaining yk program costs during none of the company s other it projects have been deferred due to its yk efforts 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the new common legal currency  the euro  which was adopted on that date 
there is a transition period between january  and january   during which the euro will be adopted into the operations 
areas of assessment by the company since have included the following cross border price transparencies and the resulting competitive impact  adaptation of information technology and other system requirements to accommodate euro transactions  the impact on currency exchange rate risk  the impact on existing contracts  and taxation and accounting 
the company s assessment is that the anticipated impact of the euro conversion on the company s operations will not be material

the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
interest rate risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes

the company s computation was based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rate and foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods 
the assets and liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions  which are hedged by derivative financial instruments  were excluded from the model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
the company s computations are based on the monte carlo simulation 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
the var model estimated a maximum loss in market value of 
million from january  through december  for derivative instruments held as of january  management periodically reviews its interest rate and foreign currency exposures and evaluates strategies to manage such exposures in the near future 
the company implements changes  when deemed necessary  in the management of hedging instruments which mitigate its exposure 
since the company utilizes interest rate and foreign currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes
