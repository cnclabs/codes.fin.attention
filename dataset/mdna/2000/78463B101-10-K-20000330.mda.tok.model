overview we are the leading global infrastructure provider of internet based solutions for financial organizations 
prior to september   we were the technology subsidiary of security first network bank  which was the first internet bank 
on september   we completed a reorganization to separate our banking and technology businesses  and then sold the banking business to a subsidiary of royal bank of canada 
in november  we completed the acquisitions of edify  fics and verticalone 
on november   we changed our name from security first technologies corporation to s corporation 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from three sources software licenses 
we receive license fees from direct licensees and third party data processors 
direct licensees install and operate our products in their own data centers 
we generally receive an initial license fee plus ongoing fees which are based on either the number of end users or a percentage of the initial license fee 
we generally recognize revenues from software license sales upon shipment where no significant obligations remain  in accordance with aicpa statement of position when services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  the software license and the related services are recognized over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
a portion of our software license revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over either the term of the agreement or  for contracts without a term  the estimated period during which post contract support is expected to be provided 
under these arrangements  post contract support and maintenance were bundled as part of the license agreements and sufficient vendor specific evidence did not exist to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
third party data processors install our products in their own data processing centers and license the product to their client institutions  typically smaller financial services entities like community banks and thrifts 
we receive monthly fees from third party data processors based on the total number of end users served by the processors client institutions 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the period earned 
professional services 
we provide professional services related to the installation and integration of our products 
these services include installing the product at direct licensees and third party data processing centers  integrating the financial organization data processing systems with our data center for data center clients  providing product enhancements  consulting  and training 
revenues derived from contracts to provide services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues from professional services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
data center 
we receive recurring monthly fees from financial institutions that have chosen to use our software and outsource the processing of their financial transactions to our data center 
these fees are based on the number of end users of the client institution 
in addition  we receive monthly fees for technical support 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
expenses we expect to continue making significant investments in product development to enhance our existing products  develop new products and further advance our technology 
future expenditures in product development will be primarily attributable to the addition of software development personnel with the technological and industry expertise relevant to our technology 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base 
we expect the sales and marketing staff  which numbered at december   to grow significantly during we also intend to continue promoting our products and services through conferences  seminars  direct marketing and trade publications 
we record software development costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we currently do not have any capitalized software development costs 
we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at december  with expiration dates beginning in the year and ending in the year of this amount  million related to stock option tax deductions  which will be reflected as additional paid in capital when realized 
we have incurred annual and quarterly losses from operations since inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
business acquisitions on november   we completed the acquisitions of edify and verticalone 
on november   we completed the acquisition of fics 
all three acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of edify and verticalone from november  and the results of operations of fics from december  we exchanged  shares of common stock and  employee stock options with a value of approximately million for all of the outstanding shares and stock options of edify 
of the total purchase price of million  which includes million of costs incurred directly related to the acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill  million to identifiable intangible assets  million to in process research and development and million to net assets acquired 
we exchanged  shares of common stock and  employee stock options with a value of approximately million for all of the outstanding shares and stock options of verticalone 
of the total million purchase price  which includes million of acquisition costs and million of preferred stock purchased before the closing of the acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill  million to identifiable intangible assets  million to in process research and development and million to net assets acquired 
we exchanged  shares of common stock and  employee stock options with a value of approximately million for all of the outstanding shares and stock options of fics 
of the total million purchase price  which includes million of costs incurred directly related to the acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill  million to identifiable intangible assets  million to in process research and development and million to net liabilities acquired 
the former fics stockholders may also be able to obtain up to an additional  shares of our common stock over a two year period if fics meets specified criteria while operating as our subsidiary

data center revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the decrease in data center revenue as a percentage of total revenues is a result of the increase in total revenues due to the acquisitions discussed above 
the dollar increase can be attributed to increased end user demand for our internet financial applications  minimum fees for new financial institutions implemented during the year and increased support fees 
the average quarterly revenue per end user increased slightly to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that the average quarterly revenue per end user will decrease as financial services entities increase the number of their customers using our product 
revenues associated with the our data centers are directly influenced by the number of financial services entities that are using our products through our data centers and the number of end users of these financial services entities

in addition  the increase relates to the acquisitions of edify and fics during the fourth quarter of direct costs associated with professional services represented of professional services revenues in the year ended december  compared to of professional services revenues in the year ended december  we anticipate that professional services margins will decrease in future periods as the acquired companies historically experienced lower professional services margins than we experienced on a stand alone basis 
data center costs 
direct data center costs consist of personnel and computer equipment costs 
direct costs associated with data center services increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in direct data center costs is primarily attributable to additional costs of our new atlanta based data center facility  which went into full operation in july direct data center costs represented of data center revenues in the year ended december  compared to of data center revenues in the year ended december  the improvement was primarily the result of increased end user volume

stock option compensation expense decreased by  to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  stock option compensation expense represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted and the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
this amount is being amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
we expect this number to increase in future periods as a result of options granted to employees of the newly acquired companies 
marketing cost for warrant issued 
we recorded  of marketing costs in the year ended december  related to the issuance to a third party of a stock warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was issued in connection with a pilot project and distribution agreement between the third party and one of our subsidiaries 
the fair value of the warrant was determined based on the black scholes option pricing model 
this amount is being amortized over the period of the pilot project and distribution agreement  which is approximately days 
we expect to recognize approximately million of expense related to this agreement in the first quarter of merger related costs 
we recorded million in the year ended december  related to the acquisitions of edify  fics  and verticalone 
merger related costs consist primarily of expenditures related to building and consolidating infrastructure and other operations of the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of edify  fics and verticalone  we allocated a portion of the respective purchase prices to acquired in process research and development 
as part of the process of analyzing each of these acquisitions  we made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
we based this decision on factors such as the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market  available resources and its progression in developing comparable technology  if any 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  our product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and we may not realize the financial benefits expected from the projects

the decrease as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended december  from the year ended december  resulted from our ability to leverage general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base

depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
depreciation and amortization expenses were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a one time charge of approximately million related to the termination of an outsourcing contract for the data center 
in addition  we wrote off computer equipment totaling approximately  as the result of a physical inventory performed in the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization related to increased technology purchases in as a result of our growth 
stock option compensation expense 
stock option compensation expense amounted to million in the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  stock option compensation expense represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted and the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
this amount is being amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options

the royal bank subsidiary agreed to pay million in excess of the net assets sold 
also  there is a million holdback for indemnification which we will receive by march  if there are no indemnifiable claims 
the banking operations included substantially all of the loans and investment securities as well as its deposit relationships and were legally separated from the technology operations through the formation of a holding company and the contribution of million in capital in connection with the sale of the banking operations 
we recorded a gain of  on the sale of our banking operations 
the gain on sale includes a million charge related to the estimated fair value of options to purchase our capital stock issued to royal bank in march in connection with the sale by security first network bank of the banking operations 
the losses from the banking operations are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
net interest income for the nine month period ended september  was million and the net loss  excluding the gain on disposal  was million

as a result  we establish expense levels based in part on future projections of revenues 
revenues currently depend heavily on our ability to sell software licenses and implementation and outsourcing services for internet banking solutions 
future revenues will likely include more data center revenues  which will depend on our customers ability to attract and retain end users 
if actual revenues are less than projected revenues  we may be unable to reduce expenses proportionately  which could adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations from private sales of common and preferred stock 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and investment securities available for sale  which consisted entirely of equity securities  of million at december  compared to million at december  in  cash used in continuing operations was million compared to in the increase in cash used in operations between and is primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable resulting from the increase in revenues in as compared to cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities was the result of the net cash acquired through acquisitions of million  which was offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
capital expenditures in relate to the establishment of our new data center facilities and expansion of our facilities infrastructure to accommodate our growth 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase relates to equity sales to intuit  hewlett packard and andersen consulting  which are described below 
in addition  proceeds from the exercise of stock options was million in compared to million in these increases were offset by payments made on notes payable of million in on february   we entered into strategic alliances with hewlett packard and andersen consulting 
as part of these alliances  hewlett packard agreed to make a million equity investment in our common stock and andersen consulting agreed to make a million equity investment in our common stock 
the stock sales closed as of april  at closing  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
on february   we granted to andersen consulting warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrants will vest  if at all  in three installments of   and  shares only if we enter into agreements to sell our services or license our products to a list of specified customers as a result of our relationship with andersen consulting 
the warrants expire in february vested warrants expire two years from the vesting date 
at december    warrants were outstanding and none were exercisable 
on february   we granted royal bank a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant will vest in four equal installments if  as of four annual measurement dates  beginning one year after the completion of the implementation of specified applications within our consumer suite  royal bank has an additional one million end users using our software 
each installment terminates if the targeted customer levels are not achieved or if an installment vests  the warrant terminates ninety days after the vesting date 
at december    warrants were outstanding and none were exercisable 
as part of the sale of the banking operations to royal bank  we issued to royal bank four separate options to purchase up to an aggregate of million in capital stock 
in  royal bank exercised the first option for  shares at an exercise price of per share 
in  royal bank exercised options to purchase  shares at per share and  shares at per share 
the fourth option for  with a per share exercise price of expires in june and remains exercisable and outstanding at december  on february   we entered into an agreement with royal bank under which royal bank agreed to implement certain applications within our consumer suite 
royal bank has agreed to pay million to us on the following schedule the first million was due to be paid no later than february  with the remaining amount to be paid equally over a four year period after royal bank has implemented our software 
royal bank paid us million to satisfy the first installment 
if royal bank terminates its minimum payment obligation  it is required to pay a termination fee equal to of the unpaid amount 
in connection with this agreement  we issued  shares of newly designated series c redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a subscription receivable of million  the estimated fair value of the preferred stock at issuance  and will reduce such subscription receivable  including imputed interest  as the payments under the arrangement are received 
the right to convert series c on a two for one post split basis into our common stock will vest  if at all  in five installments 
on february   the first installment of  shares vested and became convertible 
the remaining four installments each comprised of  shares  will vest and become convertible if royal bank has paid minimum fees of  per year for the first four years following the completion date of the implementation 
if the minimum fees paid by royal bank at any anniversary date of the completed implementation exceed the minimum fee level for the next anniversary date  royal bank may elect to vest in the next installment of shares 
the right to convert series c into common stock expires ninety days after the vesting date 
any shares of series c that do not vest and become convertible into shares of common stock on or before march  become mandatorily redeemable by us for an amount equal to per share 
at december   no shares of series c were vested and convertible 
on may   we entered into a stock purchase and option agreement with intuit pursuant to which intuit purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
we also granted intuit options to purchase  and  shares of our common stock that vested upon the closing of the edify and fics acquisitions  respectively 
intuit was granted  additional options to purchase our common stock that may become exercisable based on the achievement of certain earn out targets for fics 
all of the intuit options were granted with an exercise price of per share and expire on november  at december    of these options were outstanding and  were exercisable 
on march   intuit transferred its shares and the options to intuit ventures inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of intuit 
on december   we granted a vested  immediately exercisable warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in connection with a pilot project and distribution agreement between a third party and one of our subsidiaries 
at december   the warrant was outstanding and exercisable 
the warrant expires on december  at december   we had approximately million outstanding and approximately million available under various line of credit facilities 
the amounts outstanding under the lines of credit at december  were subsequently paid 
approximately million was outstanding at december  under notes payable to a bank and we expect to pay this amount in we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
basic loss per share is calculated as income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per share is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common stock that would share in our earnings 
because of our net losses  the issuance of additional shares of common stock under stock options and warrants or upon the conversion of preferred stock would be antidilutive 
the total number of common shares that would have been used in our computation of diluted earnings per share if they had been dilutive was  in and  in year readiness disclosure statement our business operations were not adversely affected by any year issues 
prior to the end of  we acted to ensure that our products and critical internal business systems were year compliant  including forming a company wide task force  with representation from all major business units to evaluate and manage the risks  solutions and cost associated with addressing this issue 
the task force identified all business systems  products and services  including third party software we used in conjunction with our products and implemented actions for the systems  products and services which were not year compliant 
our task force developed and implemented a strategy to minimize the impact of year technology problems 
our strategic plan included regular reporting of progress to our management and board of directors 
the costs incurred in addressing the year problem were expensed as incurred in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
none of these costs were material to the results of operations in any one period 
significant portions of the costs which were incurred were not incremental but rather related to development efforts 
however  we may incur significant costs if unanticipated year compliance problems arise 
these unanticipated costs  or our failure to correct any unanticipated year problems in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects for growth 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we intend to adopt this statement when required 
we are currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement on the company 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in march  the sec released saba which defers reporting on the effects of the adoption of sab until the second fiscal quarter of the company is evaluating the implications of sab and to date nothing has been identified that would significantly change the company s historical practices with respect to the events that trigger revenue recognition and the measurement of revenue 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations would not be material 
the net liabilities of our foreign operations at december  was approximately million 
for our operating locations in countries participating in the european union  the euro was adopted as their common legal currency effective january  we have not experienced any significant problems related to the euro conversion and do not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on our results of operations 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in our investment securities available for sale which consists entirely of our investment in broadvision  inc common stock 
at december   our marketable securities were recorded at fair value of approximately million 
our investment in broadvision  inc common stock has exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would reduce the carrying value of our investment as well as our unrealized gain on investment securities available for sale which is included as a component of stockholders equity 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of our investment securities available for sale 
our only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to current or long term liabilities
