seasonality kellwood s businesses are quite seasonal 
the company generally sells its products prior to the principal retail selling seasons spring  summer  fall  and holiday 
sales and earnings for the quarter ended april have historically been higher than for the other quarters of the fiscal year 
in recent years the april quarter s results represented approximately of the year s sales and gross profit and over of net earnings before unusual items 
net sales  operating earnings  and earnings before unusual items transition period nine months ended january  vs 
prior year in august  the company changed its fiscal year end from april to january to bring kellwood more in line with the operating cycle of our business and the fiscal year ends of our customers and other apparel companies

sales increased in the nine month transition period ended january  compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
sales benefited from double digit growth in contemporary updated brands including ivy r  david dart r  melrose r  vintage blue tm  bice r  david meister tm and my michelle r  strong growth in dresses including kathie lee r  studio ease r  mhm r and sag harbor r dresses  the acquisition of fritzi and biflex which added more in sales during the transition period as compared to the prior year  continued growth in the men s shirt business through increased capacity and expanded private label programs  and growth in the recreation products business as a result of the introduction of new products and product lines to leverage brand equity 
these developments were partially offset by a change in fashion direction away from some of kellwood s traditional styled structured blazers and other garments to more contemporary softer looks 
this shift from heavier weight fabrics and structured garments to less expensive lighter weight garments also resulted in lower unit selling prices 
other factors negatively impacting sales in the transition period included continued weak demand for private label outerwear and basic denim jeans  and delivery problems in the january quarter with a number of contractors  primarily in mexico 
cost of products sold as a percent of sales increased to in the transition period compared to the prior year level of 
improved sourcing and savings generated from the vision supplier management initiative and improved margins at smart shirts worked to lower the cost of products sold as a percent of sales 
these improvements were offset by the impact of the startup of the new distribution center in trenton  tennessee  the startup of a new plant in mexico  and the phasing out of most of our domestic sewing operations which resulted in unabsorbed burden and labor inefficiency 
in addition  late deliveries in the january quarter resulting from the contractor problems discussed above caused higher mark downs and freight costs which exerted upward pressure on cost of products sold as a percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a in the transition period increased generally in line with sales 
the acquisition of fritzi in december and start up costs for the slates r line also added modestly to s  g a 
operating earnings defined as net sales less cost of products sold and s  g a declined to of sales from in the prior year as a result of the changes in cost of products sold margin and s  g a margin discussed above 
interest expense decreased in the transition period compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
this was due primarily to the decrease in average debt as a result of better working capital management 
lower average interest rates on short term debt principally due to the replacement of koret s factor borrowings with borrowings at the lower kellwood rates also decreased interest expense by approximately these factors were partially offset by the of additional interest expense due to the issuance of the debentures in july other income for the transition period included pretax  after tax of unusual non recurring financial items including a gain on the sale of a building 
the effective tax rate declined to in the transition period compared to during the comparable period in the prior year 
this was due primarily to the reduction of goodwill amortization as a result of the goodwill impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of vs

sales increased in fiscal after increasing in vs 
the prior year 
fiscal sales benefited from the continued growth of the sag harbor r line including the new sag harbor r sport weekendwear  the acquisition of fritzi which added in sales during the third and fourth quarters  the studio ease r line of casual dresses sold to department stores  private label intimate apparel programs with major discounters and national chains  and continued growth in the men s shirt business through private label programs 
these developments were partially offset by decreases of approximately related to exiting certain businesses  including counterparts a division of koret  brittania r pants  and a nurse s uniforms and a maternitywear business  disappointing results from the recently repositioned cricket lane r and melrose r brands  sales deferrals due to the timing of customer orders as koret s accessory business was repositioned to adopt a market segmentation strategy  and weak demand for private label outerwear and basic denim jeans 
cost of products sold as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal compared to the fiscal level of 
this was primarily due to improved production efficiencies and sourcing including cost reductions as a result of lower material costs and labor costs in asia  exiting certain low margin businesses  and savings generated by the supplier management initiative  one of the vision programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a in fiscal increased million or to of sales as compared to in fiscal the increase in s  g a in fiscal included the impact of start up costs for new products and brands  and increased systems consulting and quota costs at smart shirts 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions resulting from consolidation of operations in the better to bridge segment 
operating earnings defined as net sales less cost of products sold and s  g a increased to of sales from in fiscal the increase was due primarily to improved production efficiencies and sourcing including cost reductions as a result of lower material costs and labor costs in asia  exiting certain low margin businesses  and savings from the supplier management initiative 
the effective tax rate for of was a consequence primarily of the non deductible goodwill impairment charge or and non deductible koret merger costs of segment results sales and operating earnings by segment for the nine month transition period ended january  and for the comparable period in the prior year as well as for the years ended april  and were as follows nine months ended year ended change january  april  months months net sales popular to moderate   better to bridge private label apparel smart shirts recreation products kellwood total     nine months ended year ended change january  april  months months operating earnings popular to moderate better to bridge nmf private label apparel smart shirts recreation products 
total segment operating earnings popular to moderate 
sales of this segment were up for the nine month transition period as compared to the prior year 
the transition period included the benefit of a increase in sales of fritzi  which was acquired in december this increase was partially offset by the fashion shift away from traditional wool and constructed garments to lighter weight less constructed and therefore less expensive garments 
consolidations at retail  the repositioning of certain brands  and contractor delivery problems in the january quarter primarily in mexico also exerted downward pressure on sales 
operating earnings defined as net sales less cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in the transition period from in the prior year 
pressure on operating earnings margin came as a result of the shift to less expensive lighter weight garments as well as the continuing competitive environment at retail and additional mark down expenses required by the contractor delivery problems discussed above 
the acquisition of fritzi in the third quarter of fiscal added to sales for the year ended april  which  along with continued strength of the sag harbor r line  contributed the majority of the increase in the sales of this segment 
these increases were partially offset by discontinued businesses  including counterparts a division of koret  nurses uniforms and maternitywear 
operating earnings margin improved to from in the prior year largely due to improved divisional mix faster growth in businesses and programs with operating earnings margins higher than the segment average  the discontinuation of koret s unprofitable counterparts business  and improved sourcing of koret products 
better to bridge 
the better to bridge women s sportswear business continues to struggle 
sales  which were planned down  declined in the transition period from the prior year 
kellwood s new perry ellis r and burns lines are expected to attract a more contemporary  younger customer and increase department store penetration for this segment 
other marketing and merchandising initiatives are underway to address styling issues and lost market share in our better category brands in this segment 
additionally  some office  warehousing and distribution functions have been consolidated to reduce overhead 
segment sales declined in  and operating earnings margin remained constant at in and private label 
private label sales in the transition period were up vs 
the prior year 
sales increased primarily as a result of the introduction of the new slates r line of woven and knit shirts  sweaters and outerwear 
this improvement was partially offset by reduced outerwear shipments  lower sales of activewear to the major footwear companies  and reduced sales of nightwear 
operating earnings declined due to start up spending for the launch of the slates r line  the start up of a new lingerie facility in mexico  as well as unabsorbed burden and lower productivity as certain domestic manufacturing plants scheduled to be closed are wound down 
sales for fiscal year were down due to weak demand for private label outerwear and basic denim jeans 
operating earnings margins in the private label segment declined to in from in due to the impact of the eliminated brittania business in smart shirts 
smart shirts sales were up due to increased business with department stores  specialty stores and catalog houses 
smart shirts also expanded its knit shirt capability by implementing contractor and joint venture arrangements in the philippines and other countries 
operating earnings margins improved to in the transition period from in the prior year due to the resolution of sri lankan quota constraints which had caused smart shirts to incur additional air freight and temporary quota expenses in the prior year 
sales were up in and in vs 
the prior year 
the major drivers of this growth were the new knit shirt operation in sri lanka and the polo ralph lauren r business 
operating profit margins at smart remained stable at in and in recreation products 
recreation products reported a increase in sales as a result of strong demand for new products and a new line of sleeping bags and outerwear as well as a growing international business 
the segment s operating earnings margin declined slightly as compared to the prior year as a result of higher s  g a spending related to the launch of several new products including child carriers  apparel  camping furniture and travel gear 
recreation products sales were up in vs 
the prior year 
due to the increased volumes and improved worker productivity  as well as asian currency fluctuations  operating profit margins in the recreation products segment improved to in from in unusual items the koret merger 
effective april  the company completed a merger with koret  inc koret  issuing approximately million shares of kellwood common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares and options of koret 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis give retroactive effect to the merger with all periods presented as if the two companies had always been combined 
one time costs of the koret merger decreased reported earnings per share by 
restructuring and provision for goodwill impairment 
as part of its vision program  kellwood developed and began implementing a plan to reorganize and restructure several operating units that were experiencing operating losses or performing below expectations 
key components of the plan include the consolidation of similar types of operating units  relocation and consolidation of distribution facilities in the northeast  midwest and west coast  and elimination of redundancies between operating units 
these activities are currently in process and will continue through fiscal during fiscal  kellwood closed a number of its domestic manufacturing facilities as their work was transferred to kellwood facilities in mexico  the caribbean and central america and the company s network of contractors around the world 
these moves  in concert with certain other planned plant closings scheduled to be completed in fiscal  will enhance kellwood s cost competitiveness and sourcing flexibility in fiscal and beyond 
these plant closures and the related shift in manufacturing to offshore contractors relate primarily to the private label segment and are not expected to impact future sales 
cost reductions resulting from these moves will have a minimal impact on margins  as it is expected to be necessary to pass much of the savings on to customers in order to retain these businesses 
these activities are currently in process and will continue through fiscal in connection with this restructuring  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a provision for facilities shut down of pretax 
this provision consisted of termination benefits of  vacant facilities costs of  other cash costs of  and non cash charges of the non cash charges represent primarily a write down of obsolete or abandoned fixed assets to their net realizable value 
of the total non cash provision of  
was paid during fiscal the total provision of reduced net earnings and earnings per diluted share by and  respectively 
a summary of activity during the transition period related to this provision and the remaining accrual at january  is included in the financial statements at note as a consequence of the changes discussed above and changing market conditions  kellwood conducted a review and analysis of the projected cash flows for certain underperforming operating units and assessed the reliability of the carrying value of the intangible assets of these units 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed this review and identified an impairment of  primarily related to business units in the better to bridge segment 
the provision for this impairment reduced net earnings and earnings per diluted share by and  respectively for the year 
financial condition cash flow from operations is the company s primary source of liquidity 
kellwood uses financial leverage to minimize the overall cost of capital and maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility 
management monitors leverage through its debt to capital ratio 
working capital management is monitored primarily by analysis of the company s investment in accounts receivable and inventories 
leverage 
kellwood s debt to capital ratio was at january   approximately equal to the as of january  this was in spite of capital spending of  the acquisition of biflex  spent during the transition period on the stock buyback program  and a reduction in equity resulting from the unusual charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal discussed above 
these investments were financed by better performance in the management of working capital in addition to operating earnings and other sources of cash flow  allowing the company to maintain the financial flexibility inherent in a leverage ratio 
working capital 
the company s working capital requirement for inventories and receivables is influenced primarily by sales patterns  which are highly seasonal 
inventory levels are highly dependent upon forecasted sales  and receivables are a result of the timing of recent months sales and customer payment terms 
the current ratio increased to to at january  vs 
to at april  and at january   largely as a result of the refinancing of short term debt by the july issuance of the year debentures discussed below 
accounts receivable increased vs 
january   significantly ahead of the increase in sales 
this increase was due principally to the inclusion of of koret receivables in the january  balance sheet compared to at january  as a result of kellwood s debt capacity replacing the factor borrowing previously used by koret 
the acquisition of biflex in january also contributed modestly to the increase in accounts receivable 
inventory levels declined to at january  compared to at january  as a result of improved working capital management 
sales  however  for the next three months are forecast up vs 
last year 
overall  the company now has only days supply in inventory  a day improvement compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
investing activities 
capital spending was for the nine month transition period  for fiscal and for this compares with capital spending of per year before the commencement of the vision program 
the additional spending was largely for warehouse construction and development of the integrated business system ibs 
capital spending for the coming year is planned to be in the range 
about half of this is to be invested in computer hardware and software projects including additional investments in the ibs  and purchase and modification of a warehouse management system  and the other half is to be invested in new domestic warehousing and distribution facilities  new in store shops and selling facilities  and manufacturing facilities in asia 
on january  the company purchased biflex international  inc biflex  including intangible assets of the purchase price included cash of and the assumption of certain liabilities totaling the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company purchased substantially all of the non real estate assets of fritzi 
the purchase price included million shares of kellwood common stock valued at and the assumption of certain liabilities totaling the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
financing activities 
long term financings are arranged as necessary to meet the company s anticipated capital requirements  with the timing  principal amount and terms depending on the prevailing securities markets generally and the market for the company s debt in particular 
in july the company completed a year public debt offering totaling these debentures carry a coupon rate 
they received investment grade ratings from moody s and s p of baa bbb 
in january the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank to convert the interest rate on of debentures from fixed to variable 
in connection with this transaction  the company also entered into an option agreement  which entitles the bank to effectively cancel this interest rate swap agreement on january  as consideration for these agreements the company received a payment of which is recorded as a deferred option premium at january   these agreements are being marked to market and did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the company from the date of execution through january  the company expects the bank to exercise its option to cancel the swap if fixed swap rates are lower on the cancellation date than 
if the option is exercised to cancel the swap  kellwood will retain the entire deferred option premium  and the company will continue to pay the fixed coupon rate on the related debt 
in this case  excluding the impact of any acquisitions during the upcoming year  the company would have approximately of debt at floating interest rates at january  as compared to the company s objective of approximately 
if the option is not exercised on january   the interest rate swap will remain in effect  and the company will continue to pay interest on the notional amount of the swap at variable rates based on libor through july  if the option is not exercised  the swap would have the effect of converting of debentures to variable rates at basis points above six month libor 
in this case  excluding the impact of any acquisitions during the upcoming year  the company would have approximately of debt at floating interest rates at january  as compared to the company s objective of approximately 
the company maintains informal  uncommitted lines of credit with several banks  which totaled at january  there were no outstanding borrowings under these uncommitted lines at january  kellwood maintains a three year committed bank credit facility to ensure the liquidity necessary to support planned internal growth as well as to provide the capacity for additional acquisitions 
management believes that the combined operating  cash and equity position of the company will continue to provide the capital flexibility necessary to fund future opportunities and to meet existing obligations 
on november  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to ten percent of the outstanding shares of its common stock up to approximately million shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at management s discretion and depending on market conditions 
pursuant to this authorization  on december  the company purchased million shares through a privately negotiated transaction with an institutional holder at per share  which was below the market price 
additionally  during february the company purchased million shares in open market transactions at an average price of per share  completing the buyback authorized by this authorization 
on march  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to ten percent of the outstanding shares of its common stock up to approximately million shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at management s discretion and depending on market conditions 
purchases will be financed out of the company s cash resources 
as of march  the company had purchased million shares pursuant to this authorization at an average cost of per share 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  certain debt covenants may limit purchases under this authorization 
market risk sensitivity and inflation risks foreign currency risk 
the company does not believe that it has significant foreign currency transactional exposures 
the impact of a ten percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the foreign currencies in which the company does have transactional exposures would be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate 
at january   the company s debt portfolio was composed of approximately variable rate debt including the amount of debt subject to the swap and option discussed above and fixed rate debt 
kellwood s strategy regarding management of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations did not change significantly during the transition period 
except for the outcome of the option to cancel the interest rate swap discussed above  management does not expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed the coming year 
various financial instruments issued by the company are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
market interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the market value of the company s fixed rate debt 
with respect to the company s fixed rate debt outstanding at january   a increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately an decrease in the market value of kellwood s fixed rate debt  a decrease in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a increase in the market value of kellwood s fixed rate debt 
with respect to the company s variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on the company s interest expense for the transition period 
commodity price risk 
kellwood is subject to commodity price risk arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of sourced garments or the various raw materials that comprise its manufactured products synthetic fabrics  woolens  denim  etc the company is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that any fluctuations in the market prices of its purchased garments and raw materials are not reflected by adjustments in selling prices of its products or if such adjustments significantly trail changes in these costs 
kellwood does not use derivative instruments in the management of these risks 
inflation risk 
kellwood s inflation risks are managed by each business unit through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements  and cost containment measures 
management does not believe that inflation risk is material to the company s business or its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
outlook as of april  change in the fiscal year from april to january  in august  the company changed its fiscal year end from april to january to bring kellwood more in line with the operating cycle of our business and the fiscal year ends of our customers and other apparel companies 
we have decided to identify the twelve month period ending january  as fiscal in keeping with the custom of many retail and apparel companies 
as we address the outlook for fiscal  management will change the way the company s results are reported and analyzed 
in the past the company was managed  and results were reported  by the five business segments popular to moderately priced women s sportswear  better to bridge priced women s sportswear  private label apparel  smart shirts  and recreation products 
going forward  the company will be focusing on three business segments women s sportswear  men s sportswear  and other soft goods which will include the intimate apparel and recreation products business units 
management expects kellwood s sales in the first half of fiscal to be up approximately  with growth picking up in the second half as a result of the introduction of new product lines and brands  sales for the year are expected to be up approximately 
operating earnings margins for fiscal are expected to be approximately for the year  and the income tax rate is expected to be approximately
