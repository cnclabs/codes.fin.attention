liquidity outlook the major factors impacting the company s liquidity outlook are its significant heritage costs and its ongoing and future business needs 
the heritage costs consist primarily of cash payments for postretirement medical benefits and workers compensation costs 
the company also is obligated for salaried employee pension and pneumoconiosis benefits  however  both of these future obligations have a funding surplus at present 
the company has ongoing cash expenditures in excess of  per year for postretirement medical benefits which the company believes will remain fairly constant over the next four years and then decline to zero over the next approximately thirty six years 
in addition  the company has cash expenditures of approximately  per year for workers compensation benefits which will steadily decline to zero over the next approximately nineteen years 
since the umwa pension plan is a multiemployer plan under erisa  a contributing company is liable for its share of unfunded vested liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the plan 
the company believes the plan was fully funded at the time of the company s withdrawal in however  the plan has asserted a claim of  which the company vigorously contests 
the company is contesting this amount through arbitration  as provided under erisa 
in accordance with the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of  the company has made monthly principal and interest payments to the plan while it pursues its rights and will continue to make such monthly payments until arbitration is completed 
included in the payments made in was interest of approximately  depending upon the results of arbitration  the company may be entitled to a refund or it could be required to pay any remaining obligation through under the coal act  the company is required to provide postretirement medical benefits for umwa miners by making premium payments into three benefit plans i the umwa combined benefit fund the combined fund  a multiemployer plan which benefits miners who retired before january  or who retired thereafter but whose last employer did not provide benefits pursuant to an operator specific individual employer plan iep  ii an iep for miners who retired after january  and iii the umwa benefit plan  a multiemployer plan which benefits a miners who were eligible to retire on february   who did retire on or before september  and whose former employers are no longer in business  b miners receiving benefits under an iep whose former employer goes out of business and ceases to maintain the iep  and c new spouses or new dependents of retirees in the combined fund who would be eligible for coverage thereunder but for the fact that the combined fund closed to new beneficiaries as of july  the premiums paid by the company cover its own retirees and its allocated portion of the pool of retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
the company  on january   as a result of its improved financial position and dismissal from bankruptcy  satisfied all of its premium obligations to the combined fund through the end of  and made prepayments to the combined fund for its premiums for the first three quarters of normal monthly payments resumed on october  beginning on that date  the company began receiving credits against its combined fund premiums at a rate of approximately  per month through april   for a total of  this credit is the result of a recalculation of premiums by the combined fund pursuant to an order of the us district court for the northern district of alabama entered july  in national coal association v 
chater 
the combined benefit fund is faced with an impending solvency crisis because benefit expenses are exceeding premiums  and had sought relief from congress in under the sponsorship of senators byrd and rockefeller of west virginia  the house and senate conference committee approved  as a part of the interior and related agencies appropriations bill  a further transfer of  of accumulated interest in the abandoned mine land reclamation fund to the combined fund 
this bill was signed by the president and the funds were transferred 
as a part of its report  the conference committee noted that this was a short term solution and urged that the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the matter work with the concerned parties to insure the long term solvency of the combined fund 
in addition  on january  the clinton gore administration announced it will include million in its current budget proposal to be given to the umwa combined benefit fund to secure the long term solvency of the fund 
there is no assurance that this proposal will be enacted into law 
in addition  the coal act authorized the trustees of the umwa benefit plan to implement security provisions for three years benefits pursuant to the act 
in  the trustees set the level of security to be provided by the company 
in  the company secured its obligation to provide retiree health benefits under the plan by posting a bond in the amount of three years benefits or million 
the bond is collateralized by us government backed securities in the amount of  at december  the bond amount and the amount to be secured will be reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
the company is closely monitoring energy deregulation 
at both the national and state level  there is an ongoing debate about removing regulatory constraints and allowing competition and market forces to determine the price of electricity 
several states have already passed legislation either permitting immediate wholesale and or retail competition or providing a mechanism for transitioning to a competitive marketplace 
the commonwealth of virginia has passed legislation which allows wholesale competition to begin in and retail competition to begin in at this time  the promulgation of state legislation is not expected to have any immediate impact on existing long term power purchase agreements 
several proposed bills  calling for deregulation of the traditional utility monopolies  are pending in the us congress 
when  or if  some form of national deregulation legislation is enacted is uncertain 
the company is unable to predict the effect of deregulation on wei 
the company is subject to certain financial ratio tests under the terms of the master agreement 
the company agreed to secure its obligations under the master agreement by providing a contingent promissory note note 
the master agreement and note were filed as exhibits and to the company s form k filed on february  the original principal amount of the note is million  the principal amount of the note decreases to million in the note is payable only in the event the company does not meet its coal act obligations  fails to meet certain ongoing financial tests specified in the note  fails to maintain the required balance in the escrow account established under an escrow agreement or fails to comply with certain covenants set forth in a security agreement 
the company s principal current sources of cash flow from operations include cash distributions from its independent power projects  dividends from wri which will be reduced in as a result of the expiration of the otter tail contract  and interest earned on cash reserves 
in february  the company obtained a  distribution from its overfunded black lung trust 
potential sources of additional liquidity include the company s share of any recovery in the rova litigation  reimbursement of amounts paid to the pension plan after the company s withdrawal from the plan and the recovery of disputed amounts  if any  from morrison knudsen for dragline repairs 
other sources of possible additional liquidity include remaining overfunded amounts from the black lung trust  ongoing increased project earnings from a favorable rova decision  and cash flow from investment in new operations 
further  the effect of any future legislation that causes medicare to cover the cost of prescription drug benefits for eligible retirees could reduce the company s very substantial retiree benefit costs 
management believes that available cash should be sufficient to pay the company s heritage costs and fund its ongoing operations and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures in and included approximately  to repair the dragline at wri 
in addition  approximately  of unbilled dragline repairs are expected to be paid soon 
the company believes  under the terms of wri s agreements with morrison knudsen  that morrison knudsen is responsible for all dragline repairs 
wri has expended these amounts to assure continued  uninterrupted production at wri  and has demanded reimbursement from morrison knudsen for the full cost of the repair 
morrison knudsen has reimbursed wri approximately  of these costs 
on march   wri commenced litigation against morrison knudsen in the united states district court for the district of montana seeking  among other things  payment by morrison knudsen of approximately million of dragline repair costs paid or expected to be paid by wri  plus accrued interest 
the company has not recorded any amounts that may be recoverable from morrison knudsen in its financial statements 
the company hopes to further improve its long term liquidity in a number of ways  including the development of additional cash flow from existing and new business operations  and monetizing assets where proceeds on sale would exceed the expected return from continued operation 
the company also plans to seek further cost reductions wherever feasible and prudent  and attempt to reduce certain postretirement medical  workers compensation and related payments 
although management expects to improve the company s profitability  the time required to realize such increases cannot be estimated at this time nor can assurances be given that the company can achieve any such improvements
