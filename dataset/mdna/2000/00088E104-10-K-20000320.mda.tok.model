overview since our inception  the primary focus of our operating activities has been to develop proprietary technologies that enable programmers and advertisers to create individualized programming and programming enhancements first for television and later for the emerging area of television internet convergence 
we call our technologies for the television and television internet convergence markets individualized television and hypertv  respectively 
results of operations since we have engaged principally in the research and development of individualized television and hypertv  our historical results of operations are not indicative of  and should not be relied upon as an indicator of  our future performance 
comparison of fiscal year ended december  and december  revenues 
revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to an increase in hypertv sales 
substantially all of our revenues in and the majority of our revenues in were derived from sales of hypertv software  services and related computer hardware 
total costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of sales decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was the result of an increase in service driven revenues in the recent year having proportionately less associated direct costs 
total costs and expenses  excluding cost of sales  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses during of million or is due principally to the expansion of the company s hypertv business  including the introduction of hypertv to the entertainment market in we also incurred a million charge related to an incentive compensation provision that is based on changes in the market value of our common stock during the twelve month period ended march  we are accruing the total value of the award in four equal quarterly amounts  beginning march   since it is payable in quarterly installments that are contingent on continued employment by us of the executive receiving this compensation 
we have paid approximately  of the award in the form of our unregistered common stock 
selling and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due chiefly to non cash employee compensation  paid in the form of stock and to greater expenses related to hypertv 
we continue to innovate in the areas of software development and intellectual properties 
accordingly  our depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 
million or 
the sar expense for both years ended december  and was million 
in september  we exchanged all of our outstanding sars for stock options with the same exercise prices and vesting dates 
to account for this exchange  we simultaneously incurred non cash compensation expense of million as a component of selling and administrative expense and non cash income of million from the elimination of our liability related to sars 
additionally  we incurred a  non cash charge to deferred expenses for those sars that have not vested 
interest expense income net 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  interest expense is related to the million notes issued in january by one of our subsidiaries 
we chose to pay the interest due on the notes on june  and december  in kind rather than in cash 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher average cash balances in minority interest subsidiary preferred stock dividend and accretion 
for the year ended december   we had no accrual for or payments of subsidiary preferred stock dividends  compared to accruals of  for the year ended december   related to preferred stock issued by a subsidiary of ours  which was accounted for as a minority interest 
the subsidiary preferred stock was retired in november in exchange for a combination of our new series b preferred stock  which was subsequently redeemed in full in may  common stock and warrants 
in addition  we paid all preferred dividends during the year ended december  in the form of our common stock 
preferred stock dividend and accretion 
for the year ended december   we paid  in preferred stock dividends  related to our series b preferred stock  compared to no such preferred dividend payments during the comparable period 
the series b preferred stock was issued in november and was redeemed in full in may net loss applicable to common stockholders 
net loss applicable to common stockholders increased to million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december   from million  or per basic per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december  comparison of fiscal year ended december  and december  revenues 
revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of our product shift toward on line learning software and services in and away from video programming and related equipment 
all of our revenues during were derived from the on line learning market  compared to in total costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of sales decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to a shift in revenue mix from video programming and related equipment  which represented the majority of revenues in  to eschool which has higher gross margins 
total costs and expenses  excluding costs of sales  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a number of factors  including a large change in stock appreciation rights due to a higher common stock price at december   a rise in both operating expenses and selling and administrative expense principally from increased activity of our texas based regional network operation and to higher depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million from  for this increase was due principally to depreciation for the full year in of television production equipment installed in our texas subsidiary s facility  compared to several months during  and to greater amortization of software development costs in the more recent year 
interest expense income net 
we incurred interest expense of  for the year ended december   compared to no interest expense for the year ended december  interest expense is related to the million notes issued in january by one of our subsidiaries 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from higher available average cash balances in the more recent year 
minority interest subsidiary preferred stock dividend and accretion 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  for dividends and accretion on subsidiary convertible preferred stock issuances  which were accounted for as a minority interest 
all dividend payments were made in our common stock 
the increase during is the result principally of our redemption in full of the subsidiary convertible preferred stock 
net loss applicable to common stockholders 
net loss applicable to common stockholders increased to million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december   from million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have not generated revenues sufficient to fund our operations  and we have incurred operating losses 
through december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our cash position on december  was million  compared to million on december  net cash provided by used in operating activities during the year ended december  and  we used million and million  respectively  in cash for our operations 
despite the increase in net loss in the more recent period  a higher percentage of this loss was the result of non cash charges 
during the year ended december   we used million in cash for our operations  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due to both a higher operating deficit as well as a net use of cash related to asset and liability changes 
during the years ended december  and  we used million and million  respectively  in cash for our operations 
the decrease was due to lower operating expenses and higher gross margins  which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses 
net cash used in investing activities and capital expenditures with respect to investing activities  during the year ended december   we used cash of million 
these activities were related to the acquisition of patents and investments in patents pending  computer hardware and software development 
with respect to investing activities during the year ended december   we used cash of million for patents  property and equipment  and systems and software development 
with respect to investing activities during the year ended december   we used cash of million  related principally to the purchase of equipment for a television master control facility in dallas  texas and for the systems development related to the incorporation of individualized television into the motorola broadband cable set top box and to eschool 
net cash provided by financing activities we met our cash needs in the year ended december  from sales of our common stock to private investors  totaling approximately million  and from the exercise of stock options and warrants  totaling approximately million 
we met our cash needs in the year ended december  from sales of our common stock totaling approximately million to private investors  including million invested by liberty media 
liberty media also received an option to invest an additional million for the same price per share 
we met our cash needs in the year ended december  from the proceeds of a series of private placements during of our common stock totaling million  convertible preferred stock totaling million  and from the remainder of funds received from the sale in of exchangeable preferred stock issued by a wholly owned subsidiary totaling million 
with respect to other financing activities  for the year ended december   we redeemed all of our outstanding series b preferred stock by paying a total of approximately million  which represents a premium above the stock s face value plus accrued dividends 
because the series b preferred stock was convertible into our common stock at per share beginning in november  we effectively redeemed the preferred stock by buying it at an equivalent of per common stock share  a price significantly less than the market price of a share of our common stock at the time of the redemption 
the redemption avoided the possible future issuance of more than million shares of our common stock 
in november  we formed a company with motorola broadband communications sector  formerly general instrument corporation  to develop applications for the delivery of addressable television advertising 
under the terms of our agreement with motorola broadband  the company licensed five of our patents to digital adco in exchange for of the common stock of digital adco 
motorola broadband has licensed six of its patents and made a million capital commitment for of digital adco s common stock 
any capital contribution after motorola broadband has fulfilled its initial million commitment will be made pro rata based on ownership interests 
in november  the first million of million was contributed to the company by general instruments with million to follow in the next twelve months 
in february  we completed a follow on offering of million common shares as well as million common shares to cover the over allotments of our underwriters  credit suisse first boston  bear stearns co 
inc  lehman brothers  and salomon smith barney 
the total common shares of million were priced to the public at per share or million 
underwriting discounts and commissions of per share or million were deducted resulting in net proceeds of per share or million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from our sale of shares in the offering to repay approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  potential minority investments in strategic alliances and potential acquisition 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer software that was written with only two digits rather than four digits to represent the year in a date field 
computer hardware and software applications that are date sensitive may interpret a date represented as to be the year rather than the year the result could be system failure or miscalculations causing the disruption of operations 
we believe that our internal systems  relating to both computer hardware and software  will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
in addition  we believe that our proprietary software either sold directly to third parties or incorporated in products sold to third parties is year compliant 
having performed an assessment of the potential year problem  we do not expect to incur significant costs related to year issues 
however  there is general uncertainty regarding the year problem and its effect on the overall business environment 
we cannot determine at this time whether the year problem will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition as the result of significant disruptions to the us economy or business infrastructure 
impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on our operating costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  called sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   however  it may be adopted earlier 
it cannot be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its financial statements
