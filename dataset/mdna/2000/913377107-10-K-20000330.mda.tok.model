insurance subsidiaries american progressive  american pioneer  american exchange  constitution life  marquette  peninsular life  penncorp canada  pennsylvania life and union bankers collectively  the insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting 
each of the insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus exceeds its respective minimum requirement 
at december  the statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserves  of the us insurance subsidiaries totaled million 
beginning in  the national association of insurance commissioners naic imposed regulatory risk based capital rbc requirements on life insurance enterprises 
at december  all of the insurance subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to rbc in excess of the authorized control level 
penncorp canada and pennsylvania life s canadian branch report to canadian regulatory authorities based upon canadian statutory accounting principles that vary in some respects from us statutory accounting principles 
canadian net assets based upon canadian statutory accounting principles were million as of december  penncorp canada maintained a minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratio mccsr in excess of the minimum requirement and pennsylvania life s canadian branch maintained a test of adequacy of assets in canada and margin ratio taam in excess of the minimum requirement at december  cash generated by the insurance subsidiaries will be made available to universal  the ultimate parent  principally through periodic payments of principal and interest on surplus debentures 
currently  the surplus notes between universal and american exchange total million and anticipates that it will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies which are wholly owned by american exchange filing a consolidated federal income tax return 
dividend payments by insurance companies are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to american exchange from pennsylvania life without the prior approval of the pennsylvania department of insurance is restricted to the greater of of the pennsylvania life s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december or the net gain from operations during the preceding year  but such dividends can be paid only out of unassigned surplus 
as part of its approval of the penn union acquisition  the pennsylvania insurance department approved a quasi reorganization of pennsylvania life s surplus in which its previously negative unassigned surplus was reset to zero 
thus  future earnings of the company would be available for dividends without prior approval  subject to the restrictions noted above 
liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by more than million 
the insurance companies  in management s view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets that have duration and interest rate characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
the net yield on the company s cash and invested assets increased slightly from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity and equity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of million 
the fair values of these liquid holdings totaled more than million 
investments the company s investment policy is to balance the portfolio between long term and short term investments so as to continue to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims 
the company invests in assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which it operates 
such laws generally prescribe the nature  quality of and limitations on various types of investments that may be made

the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the tax code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums

none of the other life insurance subsidiaries owned by the company have psa balances 
a second proposal the clinton administration has made modifies the rules for capitalizing policy acquisition costs of life insurance companies on the grounds that life insurance companies generally only capitalize a fraction of their actual policy acquisition costs

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relates  broadly  to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the company is exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of its fixed income securities 
interest rate risk the company could experience economic losses if it was required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of its fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
the company s insurance liabilities are generally long tailed in nature  which generally permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
to date  the company has not utilized various financial risk management tools on its investment securities  such as interest rate swaps  forwards  futures and options to modify its exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  the company may consider them in the future

sensitivity analysis the company regularly conducts various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on it financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect management s assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on the company s financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels at december   and with all other variables held constant 
a and basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of the company s fixed income investments of million and million  respectively 
similarly  a and basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of the company s fixed income investments of million and million  respectively

universal periodically conducts various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate on their financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect management s assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the following analysis should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on universal s financial results 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a decrease to the operating income before taxes of approximately thousand and a decrease in equity of million 
universal s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential change in sales levels or local prices
