the discussion begins with a general overview  then separately discusses earnings by business segment 
in  earnings available for common shareholders of carolina power light company the company were million  a decrease from million in earnings per share decreased from per share in to per share in earnings were negatively affected by a decline in electric sales to industrial customers  a decline in electric revenues due to increased utilization of the real time pricing tariff  and the effects of hurricanes dennis and floyd 
continued customer growth and the addition of north carolina natural gas corporation ncng positively affected earnings available for common shareholders 
the company issued common stock in connection with the acquisition of ncng  which resulted in a dilution of earnings per common share 
in  earnings available for common shareholders were million  a increase from million in earnings per share increased from per share in to per share in contributing to the increase were continued growth in the company s service area in the commercial and residential sectors as well as a more favorable cooling season 
earnings were negatively affected by increased losses at two of the company s subsidiaries  interpath communications  inc and strategic resource solutions corp 
electric the electric segment is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north and south carolina 
the territory served includes a substantial portion of the coastal plain of north carolina extending to the atlantic coast between the pamlico river and the south carolina border  the lower piedmont section of north carolina  an area in northeastern south carolina and an area in western north carolina in and around the city of asheville 
electric revenue fluctuations as compared to the prior year are due to the following factors in millions customer growth changes in usage patterns industrial sales price weather sales to power agency sales to other utilities other total customer growth changes in usage patterns excludes industrial customers 
the increase in the customer growth changes in usage patterns component of revenue for both comparison periods reflects continued growth in the number of customers served by the company 
while residential and commercial sales increased in both periods  industrial sales have decreased resulting from a decline in the chemical and textile industries 
for the comparison period  the price related decrease is due to increased utilization of the real time pricing tariff 
the price related decrease for the comparison period is attributable to changes in the power coordination agreement between the company and north carolina electric membership corporation ncemc  as well as decreases in the fuel cost component of revenue 
the decrease in the weather component for reflects overall milder than normal weather conditions 
the weather component and sales to north carolina eastern municipal power agency power agency increased during due to a more favorable summer cooling season 
the change in fuel expense for primarily reflects changes in the company s generation mix 
for  the increase is attributable to a increase in generation 
for the comparison period  purchased power decreased due to the expiration in mid of the company s long term purchase power agreement with duke energy 
the decrease in is attributable to a reduction in kilowatt hours kwh purchased  which was partially offset by an increase in the average cost per kwh 
in  other operation and maintenance expense was negatively affected by million of storm restoration expenses incurred as a result of hurricanes dennis and floyd 
the current year was also negatively affected by an increase in general and administrative expenses 
for  a decrease in the general and administrative expenses portion of other operation and maintenance expense was partially offset by expenses related to hurricane bonnie 
harris plant deferred cost  net  decreased in due to the completion  in late  of the amortization of the harris plant phase in costs related to the north carolina retail jurisdiction

these projections are periodically reviewed and may change significantly 
during  the company had two long term agreements for the purchase of power and related transmission services from other utilities 
the first agreement provides for the purchase of megawatts of capacity through from indiana michigan power company s rockport unit no 
rockport 
the second agreement  which expired mid  was with duke energy for the purchase of megawatts of firm capacity 
the estimated minimum annual payment for power purchases under the rockport agreement is approximately million  representing capital related capacity costs 
in  total purchases including transmission use charges under the rockport and duke energy agreements amounted to million and million  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the power coordination agreement  as amended  between the company and power agency  the company is obligated to purchase a percentage of power agency s ownership capacity of  and energy from  the harris plant through the estimated minimum annual payments for these purchases  representing capital related capacity costs  total approximately million 
purchases under the agreement with power agency totaled million in other matters florida progress corporation the company  florida progress corporation fpc  a florida corporation  and cp l energy  inc cp l energy  a north carolina corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the company  formerly known as cp l holdings  inc entered into an amended and restated agreement and plan of share exchange dated as of august   amended and restated as of march  the amended agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  all outstanding shares of common stock  no par value  of fpc common stock would be acquired by cp l energy in a statutory share exchange with an approximate value of billion 
each share of fpc common stock  at the election of the holder  will be exchanged for i in cash and one contingent value obligation cvo  or ii the number of shares of common stock  no par value  of cp l energy equal to the ratio determined by dividing by the average of the closing sale price per share of cp l energy common stock final stock price as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape for the twenty consecutive trading days ending with the fifth trading day immediately preceding the closing date for the exchange  and one cvo or iii a combination of cash and cp l energy common stock  and one cvo  provided  however  that shareholder elections shall be subject to allocation and proration to achieve a mix of the aggregate exchange consideration that is cash and common stock 
the number of shares of cp l energy common stock that will be issued as stock consideration will vary if the final stock price is within a range of to  but not outside that range 
thus  the maximum number of shares of cp l energy common stock into which one share of fpc common stock could be exchanged would be  and the minimum would be 
in addition  fpc shareholders will receive one contingent value obligation for each share of fpc stock owned 
each contingent value obligation will represent the right to receive contingent payments that may be made by cp l energy based on certain cash flows that may be derived from future operations of four synthetic fuel plants currently owned by fpc 
in conjunction with this proposed share exchange  cp l energy plans to issue debt to fund the cash portion of the exchange 
the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of fpc  the company and cp l energy 
consummation of the exchange is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions including  among others  the approval by the shareholders of fpc and the approval of the issuance of cp l energy common stock in the exchange by the shareholders of the company or cp l energy  the approval or regulatory review by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the sec  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  and certain other federal and state regulatory bodies  the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  and other customary closing conditions 
in addition  fpc s obligation to consummate the exchange is conditioned upon the final stock price being not less than 
both the company and fpc have agreed to certain undertakings and limitations regarding the conduct of their respective businesses prior to the closing of the transaction 
the transaction is expected to be completed in the fall of either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances  including if the exchange has not been consummated on or before december   provided that if certain conditions have not been satisfied on december   but all other conditions have been satisfied or waived then such date shall be june  in the event that fpc or the company terminate the agreement in certain limited circumstances  fpc would be required to pay the company a termination fee of million  plus the company s reasonable out of pocket expenses which are not to exceed million in the aggregate

ncng acquisition on july   the company completed the previously announced acquisition of ncng for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
each outstanding share of ncng common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of company common stock  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of ncng have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  approximately million  has been recorded as goodwill of the acquired business and is being amortized primarily over a period of years 
ncng  operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is engaged in the transmission and distribution of natural gas 
these gas services are provided under regulated rates to approximately  customers in eastern and south central north carolina 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company and ncng signed a joint stipulation agreement with the public staff of the ncuc in which the company agreed to cap base retail electric rates  exclusive of fuel costs  with limited exceptions  through december  and ncng agreed to cap margin rates for gas sales and transportation services  with limited exceptions  through november  management is of the opinion that this agreement will not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company 
diversified businesses in addition to interpath and srs  whose results were previously discussed  the following subsidiaries represent diversified businesses of the company 
in  the company formed monroe power company monroe  a wholly owned subsidiary 
monroe is a north carolina corporation  authorized to do business in georgia where it owns and operates a combustion turbine  which became operational in december in  the company formed powerhouse square  llc  to facilitate the renovation of several historic buildings in north carolina 
retail rate matters in late and early  the company filed  and the respective commissions subsequently approved  proposals in the north and south carolina retail jurisdictions to accelerate cost recovery of its nuclear generating assets beginning january   and continuing through the accelerated cost recovery began immediately after the expiration of the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory assets  which began in january pursuant to the orders  the company s depreciation expense for nuclear generating assets will increase by a minimum of million to a maximum of million per year 
recovering the costs of the nuclear generating assets on an accelerated basis will better position the company for the uncertainties associated with potential restructuring of the electric utility industry 
environmental the company is subject to federal  state and local regulations addressing air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste management and other environmental matters 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
there are several manufactured gas plant mgp sites to which both the electric utility and the gas utility have some connection 
in this regard  the electric utility and the gas utility  along with others  are participating in a cooperative effort with the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  division of waste management dwm 
the dwm has established a uniform framework to address mgp sites 
the investigation and remediation of specific mgp sites will be addressed pursuant to one or more administrative orders on consent aoc between the dwm and the potentially responsible party or parties 
both the electric utility and the gas utility have signed aocs to investigate certain sites at which investigation includes the completion of interim remedial measures where appropriate and anticipate signing aocs to remediate sites as well 
both the electric utility and the gas utility continue to identify parties connected to individual mgp sites  and to determine their relative relationship to other parties at those sites and the degree to which they will undertake efforts with others at individual sites 
the company does not expect the costs associated with these sites to be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company is periodically notified by regulators such as the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  the south carolina department of health and environmental control  and the us environmental protection agency epa of its involvement or potential involvement in sites  other than mgp sites  that may require investigation and or remediation 
although the company may incur costs at the sites about which it has been notified  based upon the current status of these sites  the company does not expect those costs to be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
the epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative related to a number of coal fired utility power plants in an effort to determine whether modifications at those facilities were subject to new source review requirements or new source performance standards under the clean air act 
the company has recently been asked to provide information to the epa as part of this initiative and has cooperated in providing the requested information 
the epa has initiated enforcement actions which may have potentially significant penalties against other companies that have been subject to this initiative 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the amendments to the clean air act require substantial reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil fueled electric generating plants 
the clean air act required the company to meet more stringent provisions effective january  the company will meet the sulfur dioxide emissions requirements by maintaining sufficient sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
installation of additional equipment was necessary to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 
increased operation and maintenance costs  including emission allowance expense  installation of additional equipment and increased fuel costs are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
on october   the epa published a final rule addressing the issue of regional transport of ozone 
this rule is commonly known as the nox sip call 
the epa s rule requires states  including north and south carolina  to further reduce nitrogen oxide emissions in order to attain a pre set state nox emission level by may the epa s rule also suggests to the states that these additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions be obtained from the utility sector 
the company is evaluating necessary measures to comply with the rule and estimates its related capital expenditures through could be approximately million  a portion of which is reflected in the capital requirements discussion under part ii  item  liquidity and capital resources 
increased operation and maintenance costs relating to the nox sip call are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations 
the company and the states of north and south carolina have been participating in litigation challenging the nox sip call 
on march   a three judge panel of the district of columbia circuit court of appeals upheld the epa s nox sip call 
further appeals are being considered 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the epa published a final rule approving petitions under section of the clean air act that requires certain sources to make reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions by the company s fossil fueled electric generating plants are included in these petitions 
the company and other states are participating in litigation challenging the epa s actions 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear in the company s retail jurisdictions  provisions for nuclear decommissioning costs are approved by the ncuc and the public service commission of south carolina scpsc and are based on site specific estimates that include the costs for removal of all radioactive and other structures at the site 
in the wholesale jurisdiction  the provisions for nuclear decommissioning costs are based on amounts agreed upon in applicable rate agreements 
based on the site specific estimates discussed below  and using an assumed after tax earnings rate of and an assumed cost escalation rate of  current levels of rate recovery for nuclear decommissioning costs are adequate to provide for decommissioning of the company s nuclear facilities 
the company s most recent site specific estimates of decommissioning costs were developed in  using cost factors  and are based on prompt dismantlement decommissioning  which reflects the cost of removal of all radioactive and other structures currently at the site  with such removal occurring shortly after operating license expiration 
these estimates  in dollars  are million for robinson unit no 
 million for brunswick unit no 
 million for brunswick unit no 
and million for the harris plant 
the estimates are subject to change based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  cost escalation  changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal  state or local regulations 
the cost estimates exclude the portion attributable to power agency  which holds an undivided ownership interest in the brunswick and harris nuclear generating facilities 
operating licenses for the company s nuclear units expire in the year for robinson unit no 
 for brunswick unit no 
 for brunswick unit no 
and for the harris plant 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is proceeding with its project regarding accounting practices related to obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets  and an exposure draft of a proposed accounting standard was issued during the first quarter of it is uncertain what effects it may ultimately have on the company s accounting for nuclear decommissioning and other retirement costs 
as required under the nuclear waste policy act of  the company entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe under which the doe agreed to begin taking spent nuclear fuel by no later than january  all similarly situated utilities were required to sign the same standard contract 
in april  the doe issued a final interpretation that it did not have an unconditional obligation to take spent nuclear fuel by january  in indiana michigan power v 
doe  the court of appeals vacated the doe s final interpretation and ruled that the doe had an unconditional obligation to begin taking spent nuclear fuel 
the court did not specify a remedy because the doe was not yet in default 
after the doe failed to comply with the decision in indiana michigan power v 
doe  a group of utilities including the company petitioned the court of appeals in northern states power nsp v 
doe  seeking an order requiring the doe to begin taking spent nuclear fuel by january  the doe took the position that their delay was unavoidable  and the doe was excused from performance under the terms and conditions of the contract 
the court of appeals issued an order which precluded the doe from treating the delay as an unavoidable delay 
however  the court of appeals did not order the doe to begin taking spent nuclear fuel  stating that the utilities had a potentially adequate remedy by filing a claim for damages under the contract 
after the doe failed to begin taking spent nuclear fuel by january   a group of utilities including the company filed a motion with the court of appeals to enforce the mandate in nsp v 
doe 
specifically  the utilities asked the court to permit the utilities to escrow their waste fee payments  to order the doe not to use the waste fund to pay damages to the utilities  and to order the doe to establish a schedule for disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
the court denied this motion based primarily on the grounds that a review of the matter was premature and that some of the requested remedies fell outside of the mandate in nsp v 
doe 
subsequently  a number of utilities each filed an action for damages in the court of claims and before the court of appeals 
the company is in the process of evaluating whether it should file a similar action for damages 
in nsp v 
us  the court of claims decided that nsp must pursue its administrative remedies instead of filing an action in the court of claims 
nsp has filed an interlocutory appeal to the court of appeals based on nsp s position that the court of claims has jurisdiction to decide the matter 
a group of utilities including the company has submitted an amicus brief in support of nsp s position 
the company also continues to monitor legislation that has been introduced in congress which might provide some limited relief 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
with certain modifications and additional approval by the nrc  the company s spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated on the company s system through the expiration of the current operating licenses for all of the company s nuclear generating units 
subsequent to the expiration of these licenses  dry storage may be necessary 
the company has initiated the process of obtaining the additional nrc approval 
competition general in recent years  the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in competition at the wholesale level  caused by changes in federal law and regulatory policy 
several states have also decided to restructure aspects of retail electric service 
the issue of retail restructuring and competition is being reviewed by a number of states and bills have been introduced in congress that seek to introduce such restructuring in all states 
allowing increased competition in the generation and sale of electric power will require resolution of many complex issues 
one of the major issues to be resolved is who will pay for stranded costs 
stranded costs are those costs and investments made by utilities in order to meet their statutory obligation to provide electric service  but which could not be recovered through the market price for electricity following industry restructuring 
the amount of such stranded costs that the company might experience would depend on the timing of  and the extent to which  direct competition is introduced  and the then existing market price of energy 
if electric utilities were no longer subject to cost based regulation and it were not possible to recover stranded costs  the financial position and results of operations of the company could be adversely affected 
wholesale competition since passage of the national energy act of energy act  competition in the wholesale electric utility industry has significantly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers  wholesale power marketers and brokers  and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on various commodities exchanges 
this increased competition could affect the company s load forecasts  plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues 
the impact could vary depending on the extent to which additional generation is built to compete in the wholesale market  new opportunities are created for the company to expand its wholesale load  or current wholesale customers elect to purchase from other suppliers after existing contracts expire 
to assist in the development of wholesale competition  the ferc  in  issued standards for wholesale wheeling of electric power through its rules on open access transmission and stranded costs and on information systems and standards of conduct orders and 
the rules require all transmitting utilities to have on file an open access transmission tariff  which contains provisions for the recovery of stranded costs and numerous other provisions that could affect the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level 
the company filed its open access transmission tariff with the ferc in mid shortly thereafter  power agency and other entities filed protests challenging numerous aspects of the company s tariff and requesting that an evidentiary proceeding be held 
the ferc set the matter for hearing and set a discovery and procedural schedule 
in july  the company filed an offer of settlement in this matter 
the administrative law judge certified the offer to the full ferc in september the offer is pending before the ferc 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on december   the ferc issued a rule on regional transmission organizations rto that sets forth four minimum characteristics and eight functions for transmission entities  including independent system operators and transmission companies  to become ferc approved rtos 
the rule states that public utilities that own  operate or control interstate transmission facilities must file by october   either a proposal to participate in an rto or an alternative filing describing efforts and plans to participate in an rto 
the company plans to participate in an rto and anticipates complying with this filing requirement 
retail competition the energy act prohibits the ferc from ordering retail wheeling transmitting power on behalf of another producer to an individual retail customer 
several states have changed their laws and regulations to allow full retail competition 
other states are considering changes to allow retail competition 
these changes and proposals have taken differing forms and included disparate elements 
the company believes changes in existing laws in both north and south carolina would be required to permit competition in the company s retail jurisdictions 
north carolina activities in april  the north carolina general assembly approved legislation establishing a member study commission to evaluate the future of electric service in the state 
during  the study commission met and held public hearings around the state 
the study commission also retained consultants to conduct analyses and studies concerning various restructuring issues  including stranded costs  state and local tax implications and electric rate comparisons 
in june  the study commission issued an interim report to the north carolina general assembly  summarizing the numerous fact finding and educational activities and analytical projects the study commission had initiated or completed 
that report offered no judgments or recommendations 
in may  the north carolina general assembly approved legislation that expanded the study commission from to members 
all study commission members were appointed by august the study commission conducted several meetings during august through november to discuss the reports regarding deregulation issues prepared by the research triangle institute at the request of the study commission 
during those meetings  several entities  including the company and duke energy  presented proposals for addressing the nearly billion debt of north carolina s municipal power agencies 
the study commission resumed meeting in january on march   the commission co chairs presented draft recommendations regarding electric industry restructuring to the full study commission for its consideration in preparing its report to the north carolina general assembly 
key recommendations in the draft include i electric retail competition should begin in north carolina no later than june   ii recovery of utilities stranded costs should not be extended beyond june   and iii the generation and distribution of assets of the municipal power agencies including power agency should be sold no later than june   and the funds from those sales should be used to pay off a portion of the municipal power agencies debt 
the draft recommendations also address issues related to the legislative timetable  consumer protection measures  environmental concerns  tax laws  and transmission and distribution 
implicit in recommendation is a rate freeze through the year initial comments on the draft recommendations were due on march  the company and other interested parties submitted comments 
the draft recommendations will serve as a starting point for preparation of the study commission s report addressing industry restructuring in the state of north carolina 
the recommendations and related issues will be debated and discussed at future study commission meetings 
the commission is expected to make a final report to the north carolina general assembly in the spring of the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
south carolina activities the session of the south carolina general assembly adjourned in june without approving any legislation regarding electric industry restructuring 
on october   the south carolina senate judiciary committee appointed a member task force to study the restructuring issue and make a report to the senate 
the task force was subsequently expanded to members  including the company 
the task force  including its various committees  has conducted several meetings to receive input from experts and interested parties and to discuss issues related to restructuring 
the house public utility subcommittee is expected to continue considering the electric industry restructuring bills that were introduced in  and the senate task force is expected to continue to consider the issue of restructuring during the south carolina general assembly s legislative session 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt and commercial paper  and fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with the company s operations  such as sales commitments and inventory 
interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risks through use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
variable rate debt has rates that adjust in periods ranging from daily to monthly 
interest rate derivative instruments may be used to adjust interest rate exposures and to protect against adverse movements in rates 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates  by maturity date  for the company s long term debt  commercial paper and other short term indebtedness at december   including current portions 
in conjunction with the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes on march   the company settled its interest rate lock  receiving approximately million which will reduce interest expense over the year debt term

there were no extendible notes outstanding at december  marketable securities return risk the company maintains trust funds  as required by the nuclear regulatory commission  to fund certain costs of decommissioning 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the fair values of these funds were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company actively monitors its portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes the costs as recovered through the company s regulated electric rates and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect the earnings of the company
