item management s analysis and discussion of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year continuing operations net sales for fiscal increased by approximately  or approximately  to approximately  as compared to approximately  reported in fiscal the following table presents our net sales by industry segment for the fiscal years ended november  and fiscal years ended november  industry segment increase retail sales    telecommunications    total    net sales of our telecommunications division  which consisted of the operations of essex and webquill  increased by approximately  or approximately  to approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately  in fiscal this increase was attributable to the rapid growth in the number of installed access lines provisioned by us during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal installed access lines amounted to approximately  on august  and grew to approximately  lines on november  revenue for each installed access line averages approximately per month 
net sales of our retail division  consisting of the operations of airline venture  inc avi  increased by approximately  or approximately  to approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately  in fiscal the increase was partially attributable to the acquisition in january of tag air and partially attributable to increased product offerings 
avi operates three retail stores in texas for professional airline flight crew members and sells pilot uniforms  study guides and travel products 
its products are also sold on the e commerce sites www

the company s gross profit increased by approximately  to approximately  reported in fiscal from approximately  reported in fiscal  and the gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal from reported in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to the significant increase in sales of our telecommunications division  which has lower margins than our retail sales division 
gross profit percentages amounted to for the retail division and for the telecommunications division  respectively  for fiscal we expect the retail division s gross margin to continue at its current level and the telecommunication division s gross margin to increase as essex converts its customer base from a resale service offering to the unbundled network elements platform une p service offering that is now available through bell atlantic corporation in the states of new york and massachusetts 
approximately of our customer lines were converted from resale to une p as of november  furthermore  effective february   the fcc has mandated that the une p service offering be offered in every state 
this ruling should help us convert more of our installed access lines to une p and obtain higher gross margins in our telecommunications division 
we estimate that in most states  the gross profit achieved from the une p service offering should be approximately  as compared to a resold line  which generates a gross margin of approximately 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or approximately  to approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately  in fiscal a major portion of the increase was directly attributable to increased labor and facility expenses incurred by our telecommunications division 
this increase in expense is directly related to the significant increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense from continuing operations amounted to approximately  in fiscal there was less than  of interest expense from our continuing operations during fiscal at november   we were the largest shareholder of access one communications corp 
access one  owning approximately of access one s capital stock 
as our investment in access one is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  we are required to include our portion of access one s net loss  up to the amount of our investment in access one  in our results of operations 
in fiscal  we have recorded a loss of approximately  as compared to a loss of approximately  in fiscal we have been advised by access one that their losses related to funding aggressive customer growth and the related costs associated with hiring employees to provision lines and provide customer service 
as a result of the losses  our investment is now carried at discontinued operations on august   we sold certain assets and assigned certain licenses of our domestic luggage division to interbrand llc  an unrelated accessories company  in furtherance of our previously announced plans to discontinue the operations of our wholesale luggage segment 
in addition to purchasing inventory  equipment and other assets  interbrand also hired certain of our employees  including our current chairman of the board  joel dupre 
upon being hired by interbrand  mr 
dupre resigned his position as our chief executive officer  and we no longer employ him 
the operating results of our wholesale luggage segment have been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented  including the prior period financial statements in which we have restated the operating results of our wholesale luggage segment as a discontinued operation 
interest expense relating to borrowings by our former wholesale luggage segment is included as operating expenses of such discontinued segment 
for fiscal  we reported a loss from discontinued operations of approximately  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of approximately  a cumulative loss on foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately  which formerly was presented as a separate component of shareholder s equity  is now reflected as a loss related solely to the discontinued segment 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal increased by approximately  to approximately  as compared to approximately  reported in fiscal net sales of our retail division  consisting of the operations of avi  increased by approximately  in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal as we reported a full year of retail operations in fiscal as compared to only three months in fiscal net sales of our telecommunications division amounted to approximately  in fiscal  its first year of operation 
essex operated as a reseller of local telephone services and value added products in the states of connecticut  massachusetts  new jersey  new york and virginia 
webquill  which was acquired in august  provided dial up and dedicated internet access  web design  hosting and e commerce development to small and medium sized businesses 
our gross margin increased in fiscal by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the gross margin from the retail division in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increases both in gross margin and gross margin percentage of the retail division are attributable to the operation of that business for a full year in fiscal  as compared to a partial year of operations in fiscal  which included start up costs and operational expenses related to establishing appropriate vendor relationships and product offerings 
the telecommunications division reported a gross margin of in its first year of operations 
selling general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by approximately  or approximately  to approximately  from approximately  reported in fiscal this increase in expenses was primarily attributable to our telecommunications operations  which were not in operation in fiscal  and to our retail division  which was only in operation for three months in fiscal interest expense amounted to less than  in fiscal as compared to no interest expense in fiscal both divisions operated without requiring a lending facility 
at the end of fiscal  we were the largest shareholder of access one  owning approximately 
as our investment in access one is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  we were required to include our portion of access one s net loss in our results of operations 
for fiscal  we recorded a loss of approximately  relating to our investment in access one 
we have been advised by access one that access one s losses in fiscal were primarily the result of funding aggressive customer growth and the related costs associated with hiring employees to verify and provision lines  to staff a customer service operation and to develop a management information system 
in addition  in fiscal  access one purchased local telephone service from bellsouth at a wholesale discount of and passed on almost half of its discount to its customer base 
the gross profit on this business was not large enough to cover the selling  general and administrative expenses associated with operating a local telephone company 
liquidity and capital resources at november   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and a working capital deficit of approximately  an increase of approximately  and a decrease of approximately  respectively  over amounts reported at november  the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from the losses incurred from our former luggage segment and the costs associated with disposing of that segment 
net cash provided by used in operating activities including discontinued operations aggregated approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to our ability to reduce our accounts receivable balances in fiscal by approximately  as compared to a reduction in fiscal of approximately  although we disposed of a substantial portion of the assets of our luggage division in august  by november   we were successful in increasing the sales of our telecommunications division and consequently created new accounts receivable balances 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities which primarily reflected the operations of our discontinued luggage division in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily reflected a decrease in inventory and accounts receivable offset by the increase in our net loss from operations 
the reduction in inventory levels was primarily due to our ability to better manage purchases relative to sales forecasts and the lack of import quota purchase constraints in fiscal that existed in fiscal the reduction in accounts receivable primarily reflects tighter credit and collection policies 
net cash used in investing activities aggregated approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the principal uses of cash from investing activities in fiscal  and were for the purchase of fixed assets 
in addition  we used approximately  for the acquisition of peconic telco  inc and  for the payment of certain obligations in conjunction with the acquisition of webquill 
in fiscal  and  the principal sources of net cash provided by investing activities were proceeds from the sale of a subsidiary 
net cash used in provided by financing activities aggregated approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities resulted in the repayment of a revolving credit line of approximately  which was partially offset by the proceeds from a private placement of common stock of approximately  a loan from an officer in the net amount of approximately  the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock in the amount of approximately  and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately  in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities resulted from a repayment of a revolving credit line of approximately  which was partially offset by proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of stock options  proceeds of approximately  from a private equity placement and proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of stock warrants 
in fiscal  repayments of short term debt of approximately  were offset by an increase of approximately  in net cash provided by a revolving credit facility 
this increase was the result of a working capital agreement see below under which we were able to borrow up to of the dollar amount of our eligible accounts receivable and of our eligible inventory 
during fiscal  we also received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  approximately  in proceeds from a private equity placement  and approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants 
on december   we entered into a financing agreement with coast business credit coast  a division of southern pacific thrift and loan association  pursuant to which coast made available to us a line of credit of  with advances based on of our eligible accounts receivable and of our eligible inventory 
this loan was scheduled to mature on december   and was paid in full on december  on march   our subsidiary  essex  entered into a receivable sale agreement with receivables funding corp 
rfc that provides for essex to sell up to  of its eligible receivables to rfc on a periodic basis and to grant rfc a security interest in the receivables purchased by rfc 
the receivables sale agreement does not transfer the risk of loss to rfc  and has been treated by us as a financing for financial statement purposes 
as of november   essex was indebted to rfc for the principal amount of approximately  essex borrows from rfc at approximately five percentage points above the prime rate  which was per annum at november  in december  essex increased the amount of eligible receivables it can sell to rfc to  our canadian subsidiary has a mortgage on its real property in the amount of  the mortgage is payable in monthly installments of approximately  which includes interest at the rate of per annum  with a balloon payment of approximately  in the year we have received an appraisal of the building of approximately  and we intend to sell the building in an orderly manner during fiscal the rental income from the current tenants covers the debt service and maintenance requirements of the building 
in fiscal  our capital expenditures amounted to approximately  we expect to make additional capital expenditures of approximately  for equipment for our telecommunications division over the next months 
such expenditures will be made in conjunction with the establishment of a network operating center in norwalk  connecticut and with the planned expansion to become a nationwide clec 
we anticipate we will be able to finance equipment purchases through equipment leases or with working capital 
at february  we owned approximately of access one  which had at such date approximately  installed access lines and revenues of approximately  per month 
although access one has approximately shareholders  it is not publicly traded  there is no readily ascertainable market for its stock  and the shares held by us bear a restrictive legend stating that the shares have not been registered under the securities act of despite the trading restriction  we have received offers to purchase a portion of our access one stock for amounts ranging from to per share and subsequent to november   we sold  shares of stock in this price range 
at february  we owned  shares of access one and warrants to purchase  additional shares at per share 
our investment in access one is recorded on our books by the equity method of accounting and is carried at as of november  we believe that the retail division s working capital and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash and capital requirements for our retail division for the next months 
our plan for the growth of our telecommunications division includes an aggressive strategy to finish fiscal with more than  installed access lines 
although we anticipate that we will have reached profitability on a monthly basis at this level of operation  we will need to expend cash and we expect to incur additional losses before we are able to grow our business to a profitable level 
subsequent to november   we received net proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of warrants and from a private placement of our common stock 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents at february  provide us with enough liquidity to carry out our fiscal growth plans 
the inability to carry out our plans may result in the continuance of unprofitable operations  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impact of year the year yk issue is the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year instead of the year this reading could result in a system failure or miscalculations and cause a disruption in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activity 
since  we have devoted significant efforts to address yk issues 
we have developed a comprehensive  company wide plan to identify  evaluate and remediate yk issues 
in addition to the planning and testing that occurred throughout fiscal  our technical support team reevaluated all our equipment during the month of december  to assure the maintenance of uninterrupted service to our customers 
in addition  our plan included a review of the yk readiness of our vendors and suppliers who have material relationships with us 
the major phases of the plan with respect to each of these categories included an inventory of all hardware and software components with possible date implications  an assessment of the yk readiness of all web sites and e commerce sites  the remediation of all yk issues which have been identified in the assessment phase  and validation testing and certification as to yk compliance 
our estimate of the total cost of our yk compliance efforts  based on amounts expended to date  plus estimated amounts of additional remediation costs  if any  is immaterial to the operations of the company 
the estimated yk costs have not been independently verified and may vary in the event of unforeseen yk remediation costs or costs related to the unanticipated costs from a third party vendor 
certain costs budgeted for the procurement of upgrades or replacements of servers and business information systems have not been included in this amount since these upgrades or replacements were being made by us independent of yk readiness 
the estimated yk costs did not include our internal costs  such as compensation and benefits of employees delegated yk responsibilities  related to our yk plan since such costs are not internally allocated by us 
we expect to fund any additional yk compliance efforts with cash flows from operations 
we have contacted various mission critical external parties and have conducted testing procedures with certain of these external parties in order to confirm yk readiness 
some of our internal data networks are interconnected with  or dependent upon  systems operated by third parties  including telecommunications data service providers and public utilities 
since external parties are responsible for addressing their own yk readiness  we are only able to determine at this time an estimate as to the extent to which any such conditions exist  and if they do exist  the extent to which they may have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
subsequent to december   we experienced no significant events  nor received any significant reports indicating any material yk issues 
we are unaware of any uncorrected problems regarding the yk issue at this time  but will continue to monitor for any potential problems throughout new accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard  reporting comprehensive income statement 
statement establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income  as defined  is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
the provisions of statement are effective for periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted this standard for our fiscal year ending november  in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement  which establishes standards for segment reporting and disclosure of additional information on products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the provisions of statement are effective for periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted this standard for our fiscal year ending november  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our debt is currently limited to  under our current borrowing arrangements and such borrowings are at an effective rate of five percent over the prime rate 
we currently do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes
