this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements and therefore  prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  without limitation  the factors set forth under risk factors and certain factors affecting forward looking statements  the discussion set forth below and the matters set forth in this form k generally 
overview we were founded in with the mission to provide a broad range of chemistry services throughout the drug discovery and development process 
as our customers needs have expanded and contract chemistry research has increased  we have expanded our service offerings and physical facilities 
in january  we added our first cgmp manufacturing facility and in may  we added analytical chemistry services 
we completed a  square foot expansion of our albany  new york facility in january we have begun an expansion of our operations at our rensselaer  new york site 
this expansion will accommodate additional medicinal chemistry and chemical development laboratories 
recent acquisitions 
in october  we completed a merger with enzymed  inc  a provider of combinatorial biocatalysis discovery services in which the former stockholders of enzymed received shares of our stock valued at million 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
enzymed provided us with a combinatorial biocatalysis platform for drug discovery technology 
the acquired technology uses enzymes and microbial systems to produce new synthetic transformations of compounds 
this technology also produces greater diversity of novel compounds suitable for lead discovery and optimization 
in december  we made an investment in organichem corporation  a delaware corporation 
organichem was formed through a management buyout of the nycomed amersham  plc chemical manufacturing facility located in rensselaer  new york 
we acquired shares of common stock of organichem  representing of organichem  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we also lent million to organichem in the form of a convertible subordinated debenture 
the debenture is convertible at our option in into a number of shares sufficient to give us ownership of organichem 
we can  at that time  acquire the remaining of organichem for a price to be determinable based upon organichem s financial performance  which can be between million and million payable in cash or a combination of cash and stock at our option 
in addition  the other holders of ownership interests in organichem have the right to require us to purchase their ownership interests in organichem in based on price calculated using a predetermined formula 
in february  we purchased american advanced organics  a provider of rapid scale up manufacturing services  for approximately million in cash and stock 
an additional  in the aggregate may be paid out in and based on the financial performance of aao 
net contract revenue our net contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers  net of our reimbursed expenses 
reimbursed expenses consist of laboratory supplies  chemicals and other costs reimbursed by our customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are netted against gross contract revenue 
reimbursed expenses vary from contract to contract 
accordingly  we view net contract revenue as our primary measure of revenue growth rather than licensing fees and royalties  which are dependent upon our licensee s sales 
in general  we provide services to our customers on the following basis a full time equivalent basis that establishes the number of full time equivalents contracted for a project  the duration of the contract period  the fixed price per full time equivalent  plus an allowance for out of pocket expenses which may or may not be incorporated in the full time equivalent rate  a time and materials basis under which we charge our customers based on an hourly rate plus out of pocket expenses  or to a limited extent  a fixed price basis 
typically  our full time equivalent contracts have six month to indefinite time periods and our time and materials contracts have three to twelve month periods 
fixed price contracts are entered into for much shorter periods of time  generally two to six months 
because our fixed price contracts relate to projects that are generally limited in scope and are of short duration  we have not historically experienced any material cost overruns under these contracts 
full time equivalent and time and materials contracts provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one years prior notice 
we recognize contract revenue on a percentage of completion or per diem basis 
cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties  net net licensing fees  milestones and royalties consist of licensing fees  milestones and royalties net of technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan 
we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development  which allows eligible participants to share in awards based on a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
we earn royalties from aventis under a license agreement based on sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
although we entered into the license agreement with aventis in  we began to recognize royalty revenue related to us sales under that agreement in february  due to the significant time taken for issuance of our patents and the resolution of related patent interference claims 
in  we received million in non recurring milestone payments and million in royalties related to prior periods 
royalty payments are due within days after the end of a calendar quarter and determined based on such quarter s sales 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor on the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us 
many of our contracts for discovery technology services contain provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology  including enzymes  microbial manipulation and combinatorial chemistry  lead to the discovery of new products which reach the market 
to date  we have not received any milestone or royalty payments under these arrangements  other than from aventis 
research and development research and development expense consists of payments in connection with collaborations with academic institutions  compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary research projects and costs of supplies and chemicals related thereto 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and all costs related to facilities and information services 
other income expense other income consists of interest income  interest expense  our equity in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated affiliate organichem  realized gains or losses on sales of investment securities  and other non operating income net of interest expense and non operating expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net contract revenue year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data net contract revenue cost of contract revenue gross profit from contract revenue licensing fees  milestones and royalties  net operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate other non operating income expense  net total other income expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net contract revenue 
net contract revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was due principally to the performance of a greater number of projects under contract primarily for medicinal and chemical development services  which were enabled through an increase in the number of scientific staff to at december  from at december  gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in gross profit remained relatively constant as a percentage of net contract revenue 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties  net 
net licensing fees  milestones and royalties increased to million in from million in as a result of the february united states patent trademark office pto decision  we met all prerequisites of the licensing agreement with aventis and recognized and received in the first three months of milestone payments and royalties on all sales of fexofenadine hcl in the united states from november   the date of patent issuance  through december  we recognized million in royalties on sales of fexofenadine hcl for  reduced by million paid under our technology development incentive plan 
our milestones and royalties from fexofenadine hcl for include million in non recurring milestone payments and million in royalties related to prior periods and  as a result  such milestone payments and royalties may not be indicative of future amounts earned under the license agreement with aventis 
in particular  no further milestone payments are required under the agreement 
research and development 
research and development expense remained constant at million in and selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in and represented of net contract revenue in compared to in the increased expense was due principally to transaction expenses related to our merger with enzymed as well as a general increase in administrative and marketing staff to support the expansion of our operations  increased expenses for recruitment of scientists  increased rent expense related to the ongoing expansion of our albany facility and expenses related to being a publicly traded entity 
total other income expense  net 
total net other income was million in this was comprised of million in interest income  net of interest expense  a  loss from our unconsolidated affiliate  organichem  and  of other non operating expense 
our investment in organichem was completed in december as a result  we expect that our investment in organichem will have a more substantial effect on our total other income in future periods 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in the dollar increase in income tax expense was attributable to an increase in taxable income generated by us  although the effective tax rate on our net income remained consistent between periods at 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net contract revenue 
net contract revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was due principally to the performance of a greater number of projects under contract primarily for medicinal and chemical development services  which were enabled through an increase in the number of scientific staff to at december  from at december  gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in gross profit remained relatively constant as a percentage of net contract revenue 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties  net 
net licensing fees  milestones and royalties increased to million in from million in as a result of the february pto decision  we met all prerequisites of the licensing agreement with aventis and recognized and received in the first three months of milestone payments and royalties on all sales of fexofenadine hcl in the united states from november   the date of patent issuance  through december  we recognized million in milestones and royalties on all worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl for all licensing fees  milestones and royalties associated with the aventis license are subject to the technology development incentive plan 
our milestones and royalties from fexofenadine hcl for include million in non recurring milestone payments and million in royalties related to prior periods and  as a result  such milestone payments and royalties may not be indicative of future amounts earned under the license agreement with aventis 
in particular  no further milestone payments are required under the agreement 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to expenses related to biological assay study agreements with third parties pertaining to two of our proprietary research programs which commenced in february and july  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in and represented of net contract revenue in compared to in the increase was due to a general increase in administrative and marketing staff to support the expansion of our operations  increased expenses for recruitment of scientists  increased rent expense related to the ongoing expansion our albany facility and a one time expense of  incurred in early as a result of partial reimbursement to our landlord for expenses incurred by the landlord in relocating other tenants in order to facilitate our albany  new york expansion 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in the effective rate was in and in the increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the increase in contract revenue  royalty and licensing fees 
the change in the effective income tax rate principally resulted from the utilization of new york state investment tax credits in  an increase in the minimum effective federal rate from to due to the fact that our taxable income was in excess of million for  and utilization of net operating losses generated by enzymed 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business through cash flows from operations  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
during the years ended december   and  we generated million  million and  respectively  in cash flow from operations and raised  and million in borrowings during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had no additional borrowings during the increase in our cash flows for the years ended december  and were principally due to an increase in net licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
during the years ended december   and  total capital expenditures were million  million and  respectively 
capital expenditures were incurred predominantly in connection with the our expansion of service offerings computational chemistry and analytical services in  and in connection with our facilities expansions 
in january  we completed our most recent phase of expansion at our location in albany  new york 
the expansion has added  square feet to our existing  square feet of laboratory and administrative space 
the expansion costs were approximately million 
for the year ended december   we generated million from financing activities  consisting of million from our february initial public offering of  shares of common stock  net of million of the proceeds used to repay outstanding long term debt 
during the year ended december   we also used million to purchase additional investment securities 
in order to raise cash for our purchase of an equity interest and convertible subordinated debenture in organichem  we sold million of investment securities during the equity investment in organichem on december  used approximately million in cash  while the purchase of the subordinated debenture in organichem used approximately million in cash 
in addition  we used million from operating cash flow to pay outstanding debt 
our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase in our working capital for the years ended december  and was primarily attributable to the milestones and royalties earned from our license agreement with aventis  less the associated technology incentive compensation expense 
of the million in milestones and royalties we earned under the license agreement during the year ended december   million constituted non recurring milestone payments and million constituted royalties relating to prior periods 
while we will continue to receive quarterly royalty payments under the aventis license agreement  no additional milestone payments are due under the agreement 
in addition  future royalties under the agreement are dependent upon future sales of fexofenadine hcl 
we do not participate in the manufacture  marketing or sale of fexofenadine hcl by aventis and rely entirely on the efforts of aventis to manufacture  market and sell this product 
there can be no assurance that aventis will continue to be successful in marketing and selling fexofenadine hcl  that fexofenadine hcl will continue to receive market acceptance or that we will continue to receive royalties from aventis in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
the occurrence of any one of these events in the future could have a material adverse impact on our working capital  liquidity and capital resources 
we have available a bank credit facility to supplement our liquidity needs 
the bank credit facility consists of a million  three year  revolving line of credit  which converts thereafter into a five year term loan 
the bank credit facility expires in june amounts outstanding under the bank credit facility bear interest at variable rates which are based upon  at our option  the lender s prime rate or libor 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
the interest rate on the credit facility at december  was per annum 
the bank credit facility restricts or prohibits us from incurring indebtedness  incurring liens  disposing of assets and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis 
the bank credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  other than our patents  and the assignment of the right to receive royalty payments from aventis under the license agreement 
we used million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay our outstanding indebtedness under the bank credit facility 
on october   we paid million in cash from borrowings under the bank credit facility and issued million in promissory notes in connection with our repurchase of a total of  shares of common stock from our former chief financial officer and a trust for the benefit of his family 
we repaid the outstanding principal balance under the promissory notes out of the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
we also used million of the net proceeds of the initial public offering for our equity investment in and purchase of a subordinated debenture from organichem 
risk factors and certain factors affecting forward looking statements the following factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this form k 
except as mentioned above and except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion contained in this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this form k 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees that we need 
our future growth and profitability depends upon the research and work of our highly skilled employees  such as our scientists  and their ability to keep pace with changes in drug discovery and development technologies 
if we cannot recruit and retain scientists and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to continue our existing services and will not be able to expand the services we offer to our customers 
we believe that there is a shortage of scientists and we compete vigorously with pharmaceutical firms  biotechnology firms  contract research firms  and academic and research institutions to recruit scientists 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may discontinue or decrease their usage of our services 
we depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that use our services for a large portion of our revenues 
although pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are generally growing and there is a trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource drug research and development functions  this trend may not continue 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies discontinue or decrease their usage of our services  our revenues and earnings could be lower than we expect and our revenues may not grow at historical rates or at all 
our revenues may decrease if we lose any one of our major customers 
in  we earned approximately of our contract revenues providing services to three major customers 
many of our major customers may cancel their contracts with thirty to ninety days notice for a variety of reasons  many of which are out of our control 
if any one of our major customers cancels its contract with us  our contract revenues may decrease 
the royalties we earn on allegra may decrease 
we have several patents on a pure form of  and manufacturing process for  the drug fexofenadine hcl  which is the active ingredient in a non sedating antihistamine marketed and sold by aventis under a license from us 
the product is marketed in the americas under the brand name allegra and in the rest of the world under the brand name telfast 
for the year ended december   our revenues from the license were million  which was approximately of our total revenues 
however  allegra sales may decrease for a variety of reasons  including the introduction of a superior drug into the marketplace or the discovery of unintended side effects from the use of allegra 
if allegra sales decrease due to these or any other factors  our revenues from the license agreement will decrease 
because we have very few costs associated with the allegra license  any decrease in our revenues from the license agreement for allegra would have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unsuccessful in producing proprietary technology even though we intend to expend time and money on our research and development efforts 
we intend to expend time and money on research and development with the intention of producing proprietary technologies in order to patent and then license it to other companies 
however  we may not be successful in producing any valuable technology 
to the extent we are unable to produce technology that we can license  we may not receive any revenues related to our research and development efforts 
we may lose valuable intellectual property if we are unable to protect it 
some of our most valuable assets include patents and trade secrets 
part of our business is developing technologies that we patent and then license to other companies 
however  some technologies that we develop may already be patented by other companies 
for this and other reasons  we may not be able to obtain patents for each new technology that we develop 
even if we are able to obtain patents  the patents may not sufficiently protect our interest in the technology 
similarly  we may not be able to protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential 
additionally  efforts to protect our patents and trade secrets may be costly and time consuming to pursue 
to the extent we are unable to protect intellectual property  our investment in those technologies will not yield the benefits that we expected 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need to conduct our business 
in addition to the technologies that we develop  we also rely on technologies developed by other companies that we license 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need in the future or we may be unable to license such technologies on a commercially reasonable basis 
our inability to license the technologies that we need could result in increased costs and  therefore  reduced profits  or the inability to engage in certain activities that require those technologies 
our failure to manage our expansion may adversely affect us 
our business has expanded rapidly in the past several years 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will continue to expand 
expansion places increased stress on our financial  managerial and human resources 
as we expand  we will need to recruit and retain additional highly skilled scientists and technicians 
expansion of our facilities may lead to increased expenses and may divert management attention away from operations 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we may engage in acquisitions and strategic relationships 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner 
we may have to devote a significant amount of time and management and financial resources to do so 
even with this investment of management and financial resources  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize the benefits of recent acquisitions and strategic investments 
in october  we merged with enzymed  inc  a provider of combinatorial biocatalysis discovery services based in iowa 
in february  we acquired american advanced organics  inc  a contract manufacturer of gram to multi kilogram lots of novel compounds  pharmaceutical intermediates  and test drug substances 
we may not be able to successfully integrate either of these acquisitions with our other operations and the transactions may not be as beneficial to us as we expect 
in addition to these acquisitions  we made a million strategic investment in organichem corporation in december to facilitate a management buy out of a chemical manufacturing facility from nycomed amersham  plc 
if organichem fails to perform as we expect  our investment may not yield adequate returns or we may lose our investment 
in addition  the other equity holders of organichem have the right to require us to purchase their interests in organichem based on a predetermined formula 
we may be required to purchase these interests at a price which is higher than the fair market value of these interests at the time of purchase  which would negatively impact our financial condition 
we may lose one or more of our key employees 
our business is highly dependent on our senior management and scientific staff  including dr 
thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
donald e 
kuhla  our president and chief operating officer  and david p 
waldek  our chief financial officer and treasurer 
although we have employment agreements with the individuals listed above  we do not have employment agreements with all of our key employees 
additionally  the loss of any of our other key employees  including our scientists  may have an adverse effect on our business 
the royalties we earn on allegra may be affected by the seasonal nature of allergies 
allergic reactions to plants  pollens and other airborne allergens occur only during the spring and summer seasons 
therefore  we expect the demand for allegra to be lower during other times of the year 
because allegra sales change seasonally based on the demand for allergy medicines  our quarter to quarter revenues will experience fluctuations 
we face increased competition 
we compete directly with the in house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies  and research and academic institutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us 
as new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available  we expect to face increased competition 
in the future  any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete 
while we plan to develop technologies which will give us competitive advantages  our competitors plan to do the same 
we may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully compete in the future 
we may be held liable for harm caused by drugs that we develop and test 
we develop  test and  to a limited extent  manufacture drugs that are used by humans 
if any one of the drugs that we test  develop or manufacture harms people  we may be required to pay damages to those persons 
although we carry product liability insurance  we may be required to pay damages in excess of the amounts of our insurance coverage 
damages awarded in a products liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we may also incur expenses relating to compliance with environmental laws 
such expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
if we fail to meet strict regulatory requirements  we could be required to pay fines or even close our facilities 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used to manufacture drugs in the united states must conform to standards that are established by the federal food and drug administration 
the fda conducts scheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our compliance with regulatory standards 
if the fda finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards  they may impose fines on us or  if the fda determines that our non compliance is severe  they may close our facilities 
any adverse action by the fda would have a negative impact on our operations 
our operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our facilities in albany 
we depend on our laboratories and equipment for the continued operation of our business 
our research and development operations and all administrative functions are primarily conducted at our facilities in albany and rensselaer  new york 
although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events  catastrophic events could still disrupt our operations 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event in the albany area could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
health care reform could reduce the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell which  in turn  could reduce the amounts that they have available to retain our services 
we depend on contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for most of our revenues 
we therefore depend upon the ability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to earn enough on the drugs they market to devote substantial resources to the research and development of new drugs 
we expect that politicians and others may try to enact laws which would limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
such laws may have the effect of reducing the resources that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs  the amount of services that we perform  and therefore our revenues  could be reduced 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and affect a change of control of our company is limited  which may not be in our stockholders best interests 
there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the following our certificate of incorporation provides for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year  commonly referred to as a staggered board 
by preventing stockholders from voting on the election of more than one class of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders  this provision may have the effect of keeping the current members of our board of directors in control for a longer period of time than stockholders may desire 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued  which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control 
additionally  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  in general  imposes restrictions upon acquirors of or more of our stock
