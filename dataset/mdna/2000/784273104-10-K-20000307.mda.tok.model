these increases were partially offset by an increase in the loan and lease loss provision of due to the growth in the loan portfolio and by an increase in non interest expense of million relating to the acquisition of epic funding and increased costs due to growth 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per diluted share as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in december  an increase

consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the increase of million in net interest income during was primarily a result of an increase in volume of million in earning assets which amounted to approximately million of net interest income 
the increase in net interest income in relating to the increase in volume and fees was offset by an overall decrease in the net interest margin the difference in the yields on earning assets and the cost of funds 
the bank s asset liability position is slightly asset sensitive see asset liability management 
therefore in times of a declining interest rate environment  the bank s net interest margin should be negatively impacted  as was the case in the bank s average prime was in  as compared to in at the same time the bank s net interest margin declined from in to in this was primarily caused by a decline in the interest earned on earning assets which decline from to  while the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from to 
the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was mainly due to a change in the mix to high cost funds 
commencing in the third quarter of and continuing in early  the fomc has increased interest rates by basis points 
this has caused the bank s prime rate to increase from to 
due to the competitive nature of the bank s market  a decline in the bank s interest rate sensitivity and an overall increase in its cost of funds due to a changing mix of deposit products and borrowings the bank s net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis remained stable in the fourth quarter versus the immediately preceding quarter at 
even though the bank is asset sensitive  further increases in interest rates may not have a significant  if any  positive impact on its net interest margin 
consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the increase of million in net interest income during was primarily a result of an increase in volume of million in earning assets which amounted to approximately million of net interest income and an increase of approximately in loan fees 
late in  the federal open market committee fomc decreased the interbank borrowing rate by basis points and the discount rate by basis points which resulted in a decrease in the bank s prime rate from to 
the bank s average prime was in  as compared to in in a declining rate environment  the company must generally increase its earning assets in order to maintain net interest income growth 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in the difference was due primarily to the increase in volume approximately million in addition to an overall increase in interest rates paid 
actual interest expense rates increased from to 
this occurred while the average prime rate deceased basis points 
in addition the level of non interest bearing deposits declined from an average of of average deposits in to in interest expense in was million as compared to million in the difference was due primarily to the increase in volume offset by the decrease in overall interest rate paid 
actual interest expense rates declined from to 
this compares to a decrease in the yields on earning assets from in to in a substantial portion of the bank s deposits an average of in and in are non interest bearing and therefore do not reprice when interest rates change 
see funding 
this is somewhat ameliorated by a significant amount of customer corporate account balances which are tied to earnings credits and utilized to offset bank service costs 
due to the nature of the company s lending markets  in which loans are generally tied to the prime rate  it is believed an increase in interest rates should positively affect the company s future earnings  while a decline in interest rates would have a negative impact 
should interest rates decline in the future  management believes that net interest income could be negatively impacted and it is not feasible to provide an accurate measure of such a change because of the many factors many of which are uncontrollable influencing the result 
the company s net interest margin for the periods presented is high relative to its peer group  mainly due to its high proportion of non interest bearing deposits and the impact of its generally higher yielding loans  but specifically leasing  factoring and asset based lending 
net interest income also reflects the impact of nonperforming loans and leases 
the effect of nonaccrual loans and leases on interest income for the years ended december  through was as follows negative impact of nonaccrual loans and leases dollars in thousands for the years ended december  interest revenue which would have been recorded under original terms interest revenue actually realized negative impact on interest revenue provision for loan and lease losses the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and therefore the related provision reflects the company s judgment as to the inherent risks associated with the loan  lease and factoring portfolios 
since estimates of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses are based on foreseeable risks  such judgments are subject to change based on changing circumstances 
based on management s current evaluation of such risks  as well as judgments of the company s regulators  additions of   and were made to the allowance for loan and lease losses in  and  respectively 
management s determinations of the provision in  and were based on the measurement of the possibility of future estimated loan and lease losses through various objective and subjective criteria and the impact of net chargeoffs

increases in occupancy also related to epic and the east bay regional office 
business promotion expenses have increased mainly due to the increased efforts of the bank to penetrate new markets and to continue to develop existing market share 
legal and professional fees have increased due to costs associated with the preparation of proxy materials and the annual report  increased audit fees  legal contract negotiations  general consulting and other matters 
the increase in other relates to increased director and shareholder costs increased director fees  transfer agent fees and increased costs of annual report and other general cost increases 
total other expenses increased approximately million or in as compared to the increase is primarily related to the acquisition of epic funding corporation which accounted for approximately of the increase  salary increases of during the first quarter of  necessary to adjust officers salaries based on competitive conditions and increased data processing expenses of relating to the acquisition and implementation of a new processing system in november in addition  the bank increased the number of business development and lending personnel and incurred overall salary increases for the bank s operating staff 
advertising and marketing costs increased due to effects of greater amounts expended on charitable donations  community support events and client entertainment 
client services paid by the bank also increased due to the significant increase in services provided for client purposes 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in  in and the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the greater amount of nontaxable income generated by the investment in california nontaxable securities municipals and other political subdivisions

at december   the bank s weighted average maturity of the available for sale investment portfolio was years 
it is estimated that for each change in interest rates  the value of the company s securities available for sale will change by approximately 
any unrealized gain or loss on investment securities available for sale is reflected in the carrying value of the security and reported net of income taxes in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income 
the net unrealized loss  net of tax  on securities available for sale as of december  was this compares to the net unrealized gain  net of tax  of as of december  the change in the unrealized gain or loss is directly attributable to the increase in interest rates during late changes in interest rates have an inverse effect on the value of securities for which the interest rate is fixed 
investment securities classified as held to maturity include those securities which the company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
the company s policy is to generally acquire a rated or better us  state and municipal securities 
the specific issues are monitored for changes in financial condition 
appropriate action would be taken if significant deterioration was noted 
the pre tax unrealized loss on investment securities held to maturity was as of december  as compared to a pre tax unrealized gain as of december  the change in the net unrealized gain or loss resulted from the increase in interest rates in late the bank s weighted average maturity of the held to maturity investment portfolio as of december  was approximately years 
it is estimated that for each change in interest rates  the value of the company s securities held to maturity will change by approximately 
this volatility decreases as the average maturity shortens 
since it is the intention of management to hold these securities to maturity  the unrealized losses will be realized over the life of the securities as above market interest income is recognized 
mortgage backed securities mbs are considered to have increased risks associated with them because of the timing of principal repayments 
as interest rates decrease  the average maturity of mortgages underlying mbs tend to decline  as rates increase  maturities tend to lengthen

loan and lease portfolio the following table shows the company s consolidated loans and leases by type of loan or borrower and their percentage distribution loan and lease portfolio dollars in thousands december  commercial and other      sba      leasing   factoring and asset based      real estate construction      real estate term      consumer      unearned fee income total loan and lease portfolio      december  commercial and other sba leasing factoring and asset based real estate construction real estate term consumer unearned fee income total loan and lease portfolio general the company s loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of short term  floating rate loans for business and real estate purposes 
effective as of the merger date january  with saratoga national bank the legal lending limit of sjnb increased to approximately million 
the commercial loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to small to medium sized businesses with gross revenues up to million  as well as loans to local professional businesspersons 
sjnb s lending services include revolving credit loans  sba loans  term loans  accounts receivable financing  factoring  equipment financing and letters of credit 
commercial loans include loans to real estate developers for short term investment purposes approximately million  loans for real estate investment purposes made to non developers approximately million and loans for other investments approximately million 
sba loans are made for commercial and real estate purposes 
the bank originates its sba loans and has a policy of carrying both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of these loans in its outstanding loans rather then selling the guaranteed portion 
these loans carry a to guarantee by the sba 
the leasing portfolio consists of financing type leases made to small and medium sized businesses 
the average lease is approximately and there is no concentration of the type of equipment for which epic funding provides financing 
the increase during as compared to was due to the full year of operations for epic funding 
factoring and asset based represents purchased account receivable factoring and a structured accounts receivable lending program where the bank receives specific payment for client invoices 
under the factoring program the bank purchases accounts receivable from clients and then receives payment directly from the party obligated for the receivable 
in most cases  the bank s financial services division purchases the receivables subject to recourse from the bank s factoring client 
the factoring business and related purchasing of accounts receivable is subject to a greater degree of risk than normal lending due to the involvement of the third party obligee  the lack of control over the direct receipt of payment  and the potential purchase of fraudulent or inflated receivables 
to date  there have been no significant losses relating to the bank s factoring program 
the real estate construction portfolio consists of residential and commercial 
such loans are made on the basis of the economic viability for the specific project  the cash flow resources of the developer  the developer s equity in the project and the underlying financial strength of the borrower 
the company s policy is to monitor each loan with respect to incurred costs  sales price and sales cycle 
the real estate term loans include term loans up to a twenty five year maturity on income producing commercial properties 
consumer loans consist primarily of loans to individuals for personal uses  such as home equity loans  installment purchases  premier lines unsecured lines of credit and overdraft protection loans and a variety of other consumer purposes 
concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographic region  or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 
although the company has a diversified loan and lease portfolio  a substantial portion of its customers ability to honor loan and lease terms is reliant upon the economic stability of santa clara county  which in some degree relies on the stability of high technology companies in its silicon valley 
loans are made on the basis of a secure repayment source as the first priority 
collateral is generally a secondary source for loan qualification 
approximately of the loan and lease portfolio is directly related to real estate or real estate interests  when real estate construction loans  real estate term loans  prime equity loans included in consumer loans in the amount of million and certain other loans to real estate developers and other investors for short term investment purposes are included 
approximately of the loan and lease portfolio is made up of commercial loans  however  no particular industry represents a significant portion of such loans 
inherent in any loan and lease portfolio are risks associated with certain types of loans and leases 
the company attempts to limit these risks through conservative loan and lease policies and review procedures that are applied at the time of origination 
included in these policies are specific maximum loan to value ltv limitations as to various categories of real estate related loans 
these ratios are as follows maximum loan to value ratios maximum ltv category of real estate collateral ratio raw land land development construction single family residence  owner occupied speculative development other term loans construction take out and commercial other improved property prime equity loans the company s loan and lease policy provides that any term loans on income producing properties must have a minimum debt service coverage of at least to for non owner occupied property and at least to for owner occupied 
during the bank lowered the maximum loan to value ratio for most real estate projects 
in prior years the single family residence requirement was based on the dollar amount of the commitment 
this was changed to reflect the differences in the risks associated with owner occupied construction as compared to development done on a speculative basis 
in the latter case and in the case of all other construction projects the loan to value ratio was decreased to 
one of the significant risks associated with real estate lending is the risk associated with the possible existence of environmental risks or hazards on or in property affiliated with the loan 
the bank attempts to mitigate such risk through the use of an environmental risk questionnaire for all loans secured by real estate 
a phase i environmental report is required if so indicated by response to the questionnaire or if for any other reason it is determined to be appropriate 
other reasons would include the industrial use of environmentally sensitive substances or the proximity to other known environmental problems 
a phase ii report is required in certain cases  depending on the outcome of the phase i report 
activity total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  the increase in total loans and leases of million during represented growth from all sectors of the bank s portfolio 
real estate construction loans grew million or an approximate growth of for the major source of the growth related primarily to construction was in the commercial area 
the demand for construction in the bank s market area continued to be strong 
generally  the growth in construction loans was mainly due to the rapid expansion of the bank s market area 
demand in the housing and commercial markets was fueled by the growth in the high technology sector and the related increase in wealth of employees of silicon valley technology firms 
major projects the bank assisted in developing were several hospitality and mini storage projects 
real estate term loans increased by million as a result of the lower interest rate environment during the first and second quarters of  which fueled the demand for refinancing 
also  the bank continued to provide term funding for several of its completed construction projects  as well as the continued development of new business 
in addition the bank experienced growth in commercial million  sba million  leasing million  and factoring asset based lending million 
growth in all these areas was mainly due to the economic conditions of silicon valley and rapid expansion of the technology sector 
the bank was able to successfully penetrate the market through its business development efforts 
total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  total loans and leases were million and averaged million as of and for the year ended december  the increase in total loans and leases of million during relates primarily to the growth in the bank s real estate portfolio 
both construction lending and real estate term lending showed significant growth during the growth in the construction portfolio was mainly due to the rapid expansion of housing in the bank s market area 
demand in the housing market was fueled by low unemployment less than over the last two years and increased wealth of employees of silicon valley technology firms 
the economic climate in northern california has been generally strong in and the competitive environment within the bank s marketplace for additional loan and lease growth has become more aggressive between lenders  resulting in increasingly competitive pricing 
to the extent that such competitive activity continues during and the bank finds it necessary to meet such competition  the bank s net interest margins could decline 
asset quality allowance for loan and lease losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for loan and lease losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined on a judgmental basis by management based on consideration of economic conditions  borrowers financial condition  loan and lease impairment  evaluation of industry trends  industry and other concentrations  loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management  continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio  monthly review and evaluation of problem loans and leases identified as having loss potential  quarterly review by the board of directors  off balance sheet risks  and assessments by regulators and other third parties 
in addition to the internal assessment of the loan and lease portfolio and off balance sheet credit risk  such as letters of credit  etc  the company also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a quarterly basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the federal banking regulators also conduct examinations of the loan and lease portfolio periodically 
the company utilizes a method of assigning a minimum and maximum loss ratio for each grade of loan or lease within each category of loans commercial  real estate term  real estate construction  etc 
loans and leases are graded on a ranking system based on management s assessment of the loan or lease s credit quality 
the assigned loss ratio is based upon the company s prior experience  industry experience  delinquency trends and the level of nonaccrual loans and leases 
in addition  the company s methodology considers and assigns a risk factor for current economic conditions  off balance sheet risk and concentrations of credit 
the methodology provides a systematic approach for the measurement of the possible existence of future loan and lease losses 
management and the board of directors evaluate the allowance and determine its desired level considering objective and subjective measures  such as knowledge of the borrowers business  valuation of collateral  the determination of impaired loans and leases and exposure to potential losses 
based on known information available to it at the date of this report  management believes that the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  determined as described above  was adequate at december  for foreseeable losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is a general reserve available against the total loan and lease portfolio and off balance sheet credit exposure 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans or leases  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
finally  there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods

based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical credit loss experienced by loan or lease type and economic conditions  management has allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses as follows for the past five years allocation of the allowance for loan or lease losses dollars in thousands amount of allowance allocation at december  commercial and other      sba     leasing factoring and asset based real estate construction real estate term consumer unallocated total      percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans and leases at december  commercial and other sba leasing factoring and asset based real estate construction real estate term consumer total the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained without any internal allocation to the segments of the loan and lease portfolio and the entire allowance is available to cover any loan and lease losses 
the allocation above is based on subjective estimates that take into account historical loss experience and management s current assessment of the relative risk characteristics of the portfolio as of the reporting date noted above and as described more fully herein 
nonperforming loans and leases loans for which the accrual of interest has been suspended  restructured loans and other loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more are set forth in the following table nonperforming loans and leases dollars in thousands december  loans and leases accounted for on a non accrual basis  loans and leases restructured and in compliance with modified terms other loans and leases with principal or interest contractually past due days or more total  the increase in the total on nonperforming loans during was due mainly to a single customer with aggregate borrowings of million 
the bank believes it has adequate collateral and it is not anticipated that there is any loss exposure due to this nonperforming loan 
at the date of the merger of saratoga bancorp  january   nonperforming loans increased by approximately potential nonperforming loans and leases are identified by management as part of its ongoing evaluation and review of the loan and lease portfolio 
based on such reviews and information known to management at the date of this report  management has not identified any loans or leases other than those in the above table about which it has serious doubts regarding the borrowers ability to comply with present loan repayment terms  such that the loans or leases might subsequently be classified as nonperforming 
management has identified one saratoga national bank loan in the amount of about which it has serious doubts regarding the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms  such that the loan will be classified as nonperforming in future combined financial data 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
other real estate owned at december  and there were no properties owned by the bank acquired through the foreclosure process 
commitments and lines of credit it is the bank s policy not to issue formal commitments or lines of credit except to well established and financially responsible commercial enterprises 
such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
occasionally  such commitments are in the form of a letter of credit to facilitate the customer s particular business transaction 
commitments and lines of credit typically mature within one year 
these commitments involve to varying degrees credit risk in excess of the amount recognized as either an asset or liability in the statement of financial position 
the company attempts to control this credit risk through its credit approval process 
the same credit policies are used when entering into such commitments 
as of december   the company had undisbursed loan commitments to extend credit as follows undisbursed loan commitments dollars in thousands amount commercial and other  sba  real estate construction  real estate term  consumer  total  in addition  there was approximately million available for commitments under unused letters of credit

the bank has been able to attract a significant proportion of its deposits in the form of noninterest bearing deposits 
the bank s primary business is commercially oriented with significant noninterest bearing deposits maintained by commercial customers 
in a high interest rate environment  these funds could be subject to disintermediation moved for higher interest rate products 
to counter such possibilities  the bank maintains an array of products which it believes would be competitive if such were to occur 
in addition  in illiquid economic times possibly recessions these deposits could be subject to withdrawal pressures 
see capital and liquidity liquidity for a discussion of the bank s liquidity sources 
the bank also raises a substantial amount of funds through certificates of deposit of or greater  which were approximately of total deposits at december  these deposits are usually at interest rates greater than other types of deposits and are more sensitive to interest rate changes 
historically  the bank s overall cost of funds has been less than that of its peer group 
however  as these certificates of deposit are usually more interest rate sensitive  their repricing in an increasing interest rate environment could increase the bank s cost of funds and negatively impact the bank s net interest margin 
see capital and liquidity 
on december  the bank obtained million through the placement of a ten year synthetic floating rate certificate of deposit 
the instrument consists of two linked transactions  a callable interest rate swap and callable fixed rate certificate of deposit 
under the swap agreement  the bank pays libor plus five basis points and receives for a period of ten years 
the swap is callable after one year by a major us domestic bank 
simultaneously  the bank issued a callable fixed rate certificate of deposit 
the certificate of deposit does not have any early redemption clauses  other than by death of the holder 
effectively  the bank s rate of interest on the combined transaction is libor plus five basis points 
the bank utilizes short term borrowings in its balance sheet management 
the short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase are used for short term liquidity needs 
the average cost of the borrowings during was  the average amount outstanding was million and the maximum at any month end was million 
asset liability management the company defines interest rate sensitivity as the measurement of the mismatch in repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments at a specified point in time 
this mismatch known as interest rate sensitivity gap represents the potential mismatch in the change in the rate of interest revenue accrual and interest expense that would result from a change in interest rates 
mismatches in interest rate repricing among assets and liabilities arise primarily from the interaction of various customer businesses ie  types of loans and leases versus the types of deposits maintained and from management s discretionary investment and funds gathering activities 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
however  due to its size and direct competition from the major banks  the company must offer products which are competitive in the market place  even if less than optimum with respect to its interest rate exposure 
the company s balance sheet position at december  was slightly asset sensitive  based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest revenues are negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates and positively impacted by an increase in interest rates 
the interest rate gap is a measure of interest rate exposure and is based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and assumed repricing dates of others 
see financial review net interest income and margin 
the following table quantifies the company s interest rate exposure at december  based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others 
at december   the company was asset sensitive in the near term  as noted above 
it is expected by management that with the addition of saratoga bancorp the bank will continue to be asset sensitive

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to reprice  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
further  certain earning assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in considering such shortcomings the above table would reflect a slightly asset sensitive position 
the company considers the anticipated effects of these various factors in implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
a large proportion of the bank s deposits are non interest bearing demand deposits and are not included in the above table as they tend not to be interest rate sensitive 
the average balance of these deposits was million in in addition  the bank s total tangible capital of approximately million is not included as a funding source in the above table 
lastly  the table includes the repricing of the bank s non maturity deposits interest bearing demand  money market and savings accounts as repricing immediately 
these accounts are not subject to any specific interest rate adjustment formulas and are adjusted by management based upon the competitive environment and the bank s liquidity and asset liability positions

liquidity management strives to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to meet customer requirements for loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
sjnb s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank utilizes brokered deposits on a limited basis to satisfy temporary liquidity needs 
the bank s sources of liquidity consist of its deposits with other banks  overnight funds sold to correspondent banks and short term  marketable investments net of short term borrowings 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of consolidated total assets  as compared to million or of consolidated total assets on december  in addition to the liquid asset portfolio  sjnb also has million in informal lines of credit available with three major commercial banks  approximately million of credit available at the federal reserve discount window  a repurchase agreement for up to million in additional borrowings and million in sba guaranteed loans which are available for sale and could likely be sold within a day period 
sjnb is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
in their normal course of business  commercial clients maintain balances in large certificates of deposit 
the stability of these balances hinges upon  among other factors  market conditions and each business seasonality 
large certificates of deposit amounted to of total deposits on december  and liquidity is also affected by investment securities and loan and lease maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
the loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of floating rate  short term loans 
on december   approximately of total consolidated assets had maturities under one year and of total consolidated loans and leases had floating rates tied to the prime rate or similar indexes 
the short term nature of the loan and lease portfolio  and loan agreements which generally require monthly interest payments  provide the company with an additional secondary source of liquidity 
the company s liquidity is maintained by cash flows stemming from dividends and management fees from the bank and the exercise of stock options issued to the bank s employees and directors 
the amount of dividends from the bank is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere within this report 
subject to said restrictions  at december   up to million could have been paid to the parent company by the bank without regulatory approval 
the company s parent only financial statements are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends of million and million were paid to the parent company during and  respectively 
there are no material commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
effects of inflation the most direct effect of inflation on the company is higher interest rates 
because a significant portion of the bank s deposits is represented by non interest bearing demand accounts  changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the financial results of the bank 
see asset liability management 
another effect of inflation is the upward pressure on the company s operating expenses

commencing in the third quarter of  the federal open market committee fomc began a process of increasing interest rates to offset the possible increase in inflation and to slow down consumer spending 
through february   the fomc had increased interest rates basis points 
during this period the bank experienced very little change in its net interest margin 
for the three quarters ended june   september  and december   net interest margins on a fully taxable equivalent basis were  and  respectively 
the effect of possible interest rate changes is not precisely determinable due to the many factors influencing the bank s net interest margin  including repricing of deposits  a change in mix of the loan  lease and deposit portfolios and other borrowings  changes in relative volumes  the speed in which fixed rate loans and leases are repriced  discretionary investment activities and other factors 
although  there was not an appreciable change in the bank s net interest margin  during this period the bank experienced significant growth in its higher cost funding sources  such as money market savings and certificates of deposits 
the growth in these deposits had the impact of offsetting any increase in the net interest margin 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to reprice  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates
