item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal was a good year operationally for high plains 
revenues exceeded million for the first time in the company s history  and despite extremely low ethanol prices in the first two fiscal quarters  pre tax operating income for the year would have been million if not for the write down of the portales  new mexico production facility  and unexpectedly high grain costs recorded in the fourth quarter 
the continued strength projected for oil and gasoline  the low price of our grain feedstock  and the forward sales volume already contracted all discussed in more detail below indicate good potential for a stronger fiscal since july  the york  nebraska facility has had the capability to further refine approximately one million gallons per month of existing ethanol production capacity for sale in additional markets such as the industrial  food  and beverage industries 
even more production can be marketed as a mid grade product to certain users within these industries 
sales of these products typically provide greater margins than fuel grade ethanol  although prices for fuel ethanol during the fiscal third and fourth quarters of were higher than normal  to the point that industrial margins were somewhat less attractive 
sales of industrial grade ethanol during fiscal were approximately million gallons  increasing to million gallons during fiscal management goals for fiscal include continued increased sales efforts for these more refined products  as their pricing levels rise to compete with higher fuel ethanol pricing 
the york  nebraska facility does have the ability to switch between fuel and industrial production depending on the current market demands 
during fiscal  high plains derived approximately of its revenues from the sale of ethanol  with attributed to fuel ethanol sales  and attributed to industrial beverage ethanol sales 
approximately of revenues were derived from the sale of distiller s grains  solubles  and carbon dioxide gas  all of which are by products of the ethanol production process 
approximately of revenues were derived from state production incentive programs 
the sale prices of ethanol both fuel and to some extent industrial tend to vary with the wholesale price of unleaded gasoline  although fuel ethanol prices tend to track gasoline prices more directly 
prices for distiller s grains and solubles vary with the cost of grain and other protein animal feeds in the marketplace 
carbon dioxide prices received by the company are set by long term contracts and vary only with production volumes 
under the federal government s excise tax incentive program  gasoline distributors who blend gasoline with ethanol receive a federal excise tax rate reduction for each blended gallon  resulting in an indirect pricing incentive to ethanol 
originally scheduled to expire in september of  this excise tax credit has been extended until september  and currently provides a credit of 
per blended gallon  gradually reducing to 
per blended gallon through consequently  the excise tax credit should continue to enhance the value of fuel grade ethanol and provide a level of continuity  which supports funding and expansion in the industry 
the ethanol industry also benefits from various state production incentives 
the company currently receives approximately 
per gallon as a production incentive from the state of kansas for ethanol produced at its colwich  kansas facility 
this incentive has been previously renewed by the kansas legislature  and is currently scheduled to expire in july the company  along with other kansas ethanol producers  is currently working to promote the passage of an extension of this incentive through  corresponding to the current expiration of the federal excise tax credit for ethanol 
the kansas legislature has previously recognized the benefits ethanol provides to kansas grain farmers in the form of higher prices resulting from the significant consumption of local grain  and the company believes the incentive has a good chance of being extended by the legislature 
until recently  the state of nebraska also provided a production incentive of 
per gallon for the first million gallons of annual ethanol production at the company s york  nebraska facility 
the incentive was available for a five year period  and the company completed its eligibility for benefits under this program in november of nebraska has adopted a new program  which grants a significantly smaller incentive payment for new or expanded gallons produced within the state  but the company does not currently qualify to receive any benefits under this new program 
during one year of the initial incentive program the company failed to maximize approximately million of its allowable annual incentive 
it is possible that some portion of this amount may still be claimed during fiscal under a provision of the original program that allows additional credit for expansions of production after initial production is established 
even with the absence of this incentive during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of  improved yields and efficiencies at the york facility allowed it to contribute operational profits to the company s financial statement 
ethanol sales prices also reflect a premium due to ethanol s oxygenate see discussion below and octane enhancing properties 
demand for ethanol also affects price 
ethanol demand is influenced primarily by its cost in relation to availability and cost of gasoline and other octane enhancing products  and also by availability of alternative oxygenates where oxygenated fuels are required 
the dramatic increase in gasoline prices subsequent to december has increased demand for ethanol as a fuel extender  as the net cost of ethanol to blenders became less than unblended gasoline 
with oil prices increasing from to over per barrel  and a corresponding increase in gasoline pricing  ethanol has become a much more competitive product in the marketplace 
while a similarly dramatic decrease in the price of oil would have a negative effect on ethanol demand  such a decrease is not currently anticipated by most industry analysts 
other federal programs such as the reformulated gasoline rfg program also affect ethanol demand 
specific designated areas of the country which have poor air quality or which have elected to be subject to rfg ii are required to comply with rfg ii vehicle emission standards 
phase ii of the rfg program rfg ii was implemented june   and contains more stringent fuel volatility requirements than rfg 
ethanol blending during hotter summer months requires either the cooperation of refineries in producing a lower vapor pressure gasoline blendstock  or a change in the way volatility is calculated  in order to be in compliance 
ethanol supporters have requested the environmental protection agency epa and the united states congress to consider modification of these volatility restrictions for ethanol blended fuels due to ethanol s other benefits  including a reduction in ozone forming carbon monoxide emissions 
these requests are under consideration  but no rulings or legislation granting such a waiver have been enacted to date 
during the summer of  there was a shortage of this low volatility blendstock  creating a shortage of rfg ii gasoline in some areas 
while the epa did grant temporary waivers to certain areas during supply interruption periods allowing non compliant fuels to be used  many requested waivers were refused 
in the absence of one of these solutions  ethanol demand created by the rfg ii program could decrease during hotter summertime months in comparison to prior years 
recent negative publicity received by ethanol s competing oxygenate  mtbe  in california and other states could also affect ethanol demand 
based on the discovery of mtbe in local water supplies  california governor gray davis issued an executive order in march of calling for the elimination of mtbe from california gasoline supplies by december  several other states have also legislated restrictions on the use of mtbe on the basis that the environmental risk of its use outweighs the air quality benefit 
under the provisions of the federal clean air act  gasoline used in certain air quality non attainment areas must contain a certain oxygen content during the wintertime months of september through march 
ethanol and mtbe are the two most common oxygenates  dividing the market approximately to respectively 
if mtbe use is limited  ethanol demand and usage could be substantially increased 
however  california and others have requested the federal government to waive the oxygenate requirements of the clean air act  and to allow the use of non oxygenated fuels either locally or nationally 
the ethanol industry and certain agricultural supporters strongly oppose this requested waiver 
ethanol has not previously been widely blended in california because of their more stringent state volatility requirements 
however  california now requires all mtbe blended gasoline pumps to carry labels stating that mtbe blended gasoline has been determined to be hazardous to the environment 
the state has also granted ethanol blended gasoline a year round vapor pressure waiver to facilitate its use within the state 
the upcoming wintertime oxygenate season should provide a good indication of the extent to which california blenders will offer ethanol  and how much of this large additional fuel market ethanol may be able to capture 
nationally  there is also a movement to eliminate mtbe 
recently proposed legislation has focused on a compromise solution which would phase out mtbe over a four year period  eliminate the oxygen requirement of the clean air act  and replace it with a renewable fuels content requirement that gradually increases over the next ten years 
if this solution were adopted  it should significantly increase the demand for ethanol over this time period 
in short  current law is favorable to ethanol in that it requires oxygenate blending 
if mtbe usage is reduced and the law is not changed  or if the oxygen requirement is replaced with a similar renewable fuels requirement  the ethanol industry stands to see stronger demand and significant benefit 
conversely  the elimination of the oxygen requirement without adopting a renewable fuels requirement or other similar incentive for ethanol blending  could have a significantly negative impact on both ethanol demand and pricing 
the company has sold a majority of its fuel ethanol production based on spot market conditions and short term seasonal contracts 
it is now attempting to make greater use of longer term contracts to sell fuel ethanol see note to the financial statements 
management believes that this strategy will provide a better basis for long term planning  especially in the areas of production and margin predictability 
as of early september the company had contracted to sell almost all of its ethanol production through march of while most of these sales were made on fixed price contracts  approximately one third were done on variable price agreements tied to reported prices of either gasoline or ethanol 
the company has also announced an intention to increase its brokering or marketing of ethanol produced by other manufacturers 
this would be accomplished either by marketing product of others on a straight commission basis  or by purchasing product of others to meet existing sales opportunities 
by increasing the number of gallons it has to sell  management believes that it can be more competitive in markets not readily available to small producers 
revenues for fiscal included approximately million from marketed or brokered ethanol products  up from million in fiscal the company s primary grain feedstocks during fiscal were sorghum also known as milo and corn 
production at the colwich  kansas and portales  new mexico facilities relied almost exclusively on sorghum  while the york  nebraska plant utilized a mixture of approximately corn and sorghum 
the utilization of sorghum versus corn feedstocks is a function of supply and cost per bushel 
the cost of these feedstock grains is dependent upon factors that are generally unrelated to those affecting the price of ethanol 
sorghum prices generally vary directly with corn prices 
corn prices generally vary with regional and worldwide grain supplies  and can be significantly affected by worldwide weather  storage  planting and carryout projections  government loan programs  exports  and other national and international market conditions 
in an effort to reduce the impact of the volatility of these unrelated markets  management announced in fiscal its intention to search for an additional product that could be produced utilizing existing facilities  and the company s perceived expertise in fermentation based chemical products 
in fiscal  glycerol was identified as the most promising alternative  the company acquired a license to utilize a new patented technology to extract glycerol from its existing stillage by product  and pilot plant testing of the process was initiated in july of glycerol is used primarily in personal care products and in the manufacturing of pet foods 
it has historically been produced synthetically  primarily as a by product of the production of bar soap 
prices have ranged from 
per pound  to the current market price of approximately per pound  compared to the current value of 
to 
per pound for the stillage from which it would be extracted 
production costs are expected to be between 
and 
per pound 
while bar soap production has decreased  demand for glycerol appears to be increasing  generating the current higher market prices 
results of the pilot plant tests are expected to be available for the annual shareholder s meeting scheduled for november  the company also attempts to manage the market risk associated with fluctuating feedstock and ethanol sales prices by periodically employing certain strategies including grain futures and forward contracts 
management s stated objective is to match a certain percentage of contracted ethanol sales with forward grain positions in an effort to provide an acceptable margin  while still allowing for some benefit from favorable moves in one market or the other  and conversely taking some risk of loss from unfavorable market movement 
when market conditions permit  the company may contract for a majority of its ethanol sales and feedstock costs at fixed prices 
this risk management involves a complex evaluation of oil and gasoline markets on the ethanol sales side  and of chicago board of trade cbot grain futures prices and local supply issues on the grain side 
in february and march of  the company purchased six million bushels of july corn futures positions on the cbot at approximately per bushel  in correlation with over million bushels of grain purchases for the fourth quarter 
this position was meant to protect against a possible drought and resulting price increase  but at the same time it locked in a higher price in the event that grain prices dropped 
related grain purchases are normally subject to a cost adjustment relative to the cbot price that accounts for local market dynamics  referred to as a basis adjustment 
basis levels at the time for the kansas and nebraska plants were 
under the board 
to 
under is historically common  and were expected to go even lower if the drought became reality 
instead of contracting for the basis adjustment at a fixed amount  the company was advised by its outside grain buyer to rely only on its futures position and the company expected to be able to contract for a 
basis reduction as grain was delivered 
when the spring and early summer brought good rains  current and futures grain prices went down  but basis levels worsened  and the company was unable to achieve the expected 
basis reduction on grain purchases underlying the futures contracts 
accordingly  as the company took grain deliveries in the fourth quarter  without the expected basis reductions and closed out its corresponding futures positions  the result was grain costs that were 
per bushel higher than expected million in aggregate 
the company has subsequently hired experienced grain buying professionals and taken the grain buying function in house  with a stricter policy on contracting both futures and local basis grain pricing 
grain prices continued to decline into august of to year record lows  and despite a slight increase into september due to dry weather  the company expects grain prices for fiscal to remain at comparatively low levels 
as always  weather  exports  government programs  and other factors all have potentially major impacts on grain pricing  and any unexpected changes in those factors could adversely affect the price which the company pays for its feedstock 
as of mid september  the company had basis contracts to purchase approximately million bushels of corn and milo for its three plants 
the price to the company for most of this grain is fixed either by contract or by a combination of futures and basis contracts 
unfortunately  lower grain prices have also brought lower prices for the company s feed by products  wet and dried distiller s grains and solubles dgs 
while prices for feed by products historically rise in the late fall and winter  they also tend to follow corn prices  and have remained lower than normal throughout the last fiscal year as a result 
significant improvement in these prices is not expected in the near future due to anticipated continuing low grain prices  and an excess of competing protein feed ingredients in the marketplace 
in an effort to remove some of this detrimental reliance on corn pricing  the company has emphasized the production and marketing of wet rather than dried dgs  particularly at its portales  new mexico and colwich  kansas facilities 
wet dgs has certain benefits that distinguish it from other competing feed products  and allow some price premium to be realized in highly competitive markets 
the company has included the forward contracting of feed sales in its overall decisions regarding risk management 
management s risk management program also includes the oversight of purchases of natural gas needed to produce steam to run the plants  and fuel to fire the feed dryers 
natural gas spot market prices have increased significantly through the last half of fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal fortunately  as of september  although spot gas prices at the nebraska and new mexico plants have almost doubled over this time period  approximately two thirds of the nebraska plant s gas requirements are contracted through december at prices lower than current spot market  and almost all of the gas needs at the kansas plant are supplied by a long term ten year contract to take gas from the local landfill at prices significantly reduced from the spot market 
in december the company purchased its portales  new mexico ethanol production facility 
the acquisition of the portales plant added approximately million gallons per year to the company s fuel grade ethanol production capacity 
the company s production capacity for all three facilities  including million gallons at the colwich  kansas plant and million gallons at the york  nebraska plant  totals approximately million gallons of ethanol per year 
however  start up problems and high grain prices in the portales area contributed to significant operating losses from that plant in fiscal and although local grain prices had declined to more manageable levels by december  management believed continued ownership of that facility did not fit with its long term strategic plan for the company 
while products other than fuel grade ethanol were being produced or planned for the kansas and nebraska facilities  higher grain prices in new mexico  and the fact that the company was too large to take advantage of a small ethanol producer s tax credit that might otherwise be available for the plant  led to management s decision to sell 
as of september  the company had executed a contract to sell the portales facility to a third party with closing on that sale expected to occur sometime in late october or november of in connection with the execution of this contract  the fiscal financials include a million charge resulting from a write down of the plant s value to its net realizable value 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  revenues net sales and revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of approximately million or from the million in net sales and revenues for the fiscal year ended june  the net increase resulted from several factors increased production  increased industrial beverage grade sales volume  increased brokering or marketing of other manufacture s ethanol  and a increase in the average delivered price of fuel grade ethanol 
the increased production in fiscal resulted from improved operating efficiencies at york  nebraska and portales  new mexico facilities 
while the increased industrial beverage grade sales volumes were the result of new marketing initiatives 
the company sold approximately million gallons of fuel grade ethanol  of which million gallons were brokered  at an average price of per gallon during fiscal during fiscal  the company sold approximately million gallons of fuel grade ethanol  of which million gallons were brokered  at an average price of per gallon 
in fiscal the company sold approximately million gallons of industrial beverage grade ethanol  of which million gallons were brokered  at an average price of per gallon 
during fiscal  the company sold approximately million gallons of industrial grade ethanol  of which none were brokered  at an average price of per gallon 
the increased volume is the direct result of increased marketing efforts under taken in fiscal included in product sales and revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are million and million in revenues for ethanol produced under the kansas incentive program 
these payments  based on the company s ratable share of overall kansas ethanol production  equated to an average incentive of per gallon and per gallon of ethanol produced for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the kansas incentive program has been renewed four times since its inception  most recently in july this program is currently scheduled to expire july  however  the company maintains on going efforts to extend the program beyond the current expiration date 
management believes the kansas legislature will continue to support the incentive program in the future due to its economic and agricultural benefits 
production tax credits from the state of nebraska recorded as revenues totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
under the nebraska program  the company received  over a five year period starting in calendar  an incentive in the form of a transferable production tax credit in the amount of 
per gallon of anhydrous ethanol produced 
not less than two million gallons and not more than twenty five million gallons produced annually  at the york  nebraska facility  were eligible for the credit 
the availability of this credit  based upon original production capacity  expired as of december  the nebraska legislature amended this program in to allow additional credits for new ethanol plants  or for increased production capacity at current ethanol plants 
the company is currently evaluating increasing capacity at the york  nebraska facility that may be subject to the additional incentive  but at june  no decision had been made regarding the increased production 
currently  the state of new mexico does not provide any ethanol production incentives or tax credits 
operating losses at the portales plant  which is located in a region of higher grain feedstock costs  were approximately million in fiscal prior to allocated interest  selling  general and administrative expenses  and asset impairment write down 
in light of management s strategic goals of diversification  it was determined the portales  new mexico facility did not complement the company s portfolio and was subsequently offered for sale 
in may  the company agreed to accept an offer to sell the portales  new mexico facility  while maintaining the rights to market the ethanol for a three to five year period 
the sales contract price for the plant and other assets is  plus inventory at of fair value at time of closing 
the company recorded a million loss associated with the write down of the portales  new mexico facility to its estimated fair value based on the preliminary offer 
see footnote to the financial statements for additional information 
for the fiscal year ended june  distiller s grain and other by products sales increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in distiller s grain and other by products revenues is the net effect of lower per unit sales prices and increased sales volume 
the increased sales volume is a direct result of increased production at york  nebraska and portales  new mexico 
distiller s grain prices vary with the cost of alternative feedstocks for animal consumption such as grain 
since grain prices trended down in fiscal as previously discussed  distiller s grain prices followed this trend downward 
as noted earlier  significant improvement in distillers grain prices is not expected in the near future 
cost of products sold cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales and revenues  was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease in cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales and revenues was due to the decline in the average price per bushel for grain feedstocks and higher average sales prices for ethanol 
however  this decrease was partially offset by a decline in the average sale price of distiller s grain 
the company s cost of grain averaged per bushel during the fiscal year ended june  compared to an average cost of per bushel for the fiscal year ended june  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the increase was the result of increases in administrative salaries and benefits expense resulting from increased staffing  stock grants to key management personnel  increased professional fees resulting from side stream research and tax planning  increased investor relations expenses  and increased board of directors fees and expenses 
earnings for the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded net income of approximately million compared to net income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  operationally gross profit percentage increased from of net sales and revenues in fiscal to of net sales and revenues in fiscal the company s decrease in net earnings from fiscal to fiscal was the result of the million write down of the portales  new mexico facility to its net realizable value  increased selling  general  and administrative expenses  and increased net other expenses 
the million increase in net other expenses was due to decreased other income  which was primarily debt forgiveness recorded in fiscal  and decreased gains on sale of assets in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes were lower in fiscal due to reduced earnings with the balance related to the increase in net deferred tax liabilities compared to fiscal comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  revenues net sales and revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of approximately million or from the million in net sales and revenues for the fiscal year ended june  the net increase resulted from several factors a decline in the average sale price of fuel grade ethanol in fiscal offset by an increase in fiscal production related to the portales  new mexico facility 
the increase in production in at the portales facility was due to the facility being in operation for a full year in fiscal versus starting up in march of fiscal the company sold approximately million gallons of fuel grade ethanol with an average price of per gallon during fiscal during fiscal  the company sold approximately million gallons of fuel grade ethanol with an average price of per gallon 
in fiscal the company sold approximately million gallons of industrial grade ethanol at an average price of per gallon 
during fiscal  the company sold approximately million gallons of industrial grade ethanol at an average price of per gallon 
most of the fiscal business was exporting industrial grade ethanol to eastern europe  which discontinued in fiscal due to the eastern europe economic depression 
included in product sales and revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are million and million in revenues for ethanol produced under the kansas incentive program 
these payments  based on the company s ratable share of overall kansas ethanol production  equated to an average incentive of per gallon of ethanol produced for both fiscal and fiscal the kansas incentive program has been renewed four times since its inception  most recently in july this program is currently scheduled to expire july  however  the company maintains on going efforts to extend the program beyond the current expiration date 
management believes the kansas legislature will continue to support the incentive program in the future due to its economic and agricultural benefits 
production tax credits from the state of nebraska recorded as revenues totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
under the nebraska program  the company receives  over a five year period starting in calendar  an incentive in the form of a transferable production tax credit in the amount of 
per gallon of anhydrous ethanol produced 
not less than two million gallons and not more than twenty five million gallons produced annually  at the york  nebraska facility  are eligible for the credit 
the availability of this credit  based upon original production capacity  will expire as of december  the nebraska legislature amended this program in to allow additional credits for new ethanol plants  or for increased production capacity at current ethanol plants 
however  the company has no current plans to further increase its nebraska plant capacity beyond the expansions which it previously completed in and for the fiscal year ended june  distiller s grain and other by products sales decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in distiller s grain and other by products revenues is primarily due to the substantially lower price received for distiller s grain in fiscal as compared to fiscal distiller s grain prices vary with the cost of alternative feedstocks for animal consumption such as grain 
since grain prices trended down in fiscal as previously discussed  distiller s grain prices followed this trend downward 
as noted earlier  significant improvement in distillers grain prices is not expected in the near future 
cost of products sold cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales and revenues  was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease in cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales and revenues was primarily due to the decline in the average price per bushel for grain feedstocks 
however  this decline was partially offset by a decline in the average sale price of ethanol and distiller s grain 
the company s cost of grain averaged per bushel during the fiscal year ended june  compared to an average cost of per bushel for the fiscal year ended june  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the million management restructuring costs in fiscal  were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased compensation from additional new staff and management level personnel in fiscal  customary raises  and severance 
earnings for the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded net income of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  in addition  the gross profit percentage increased from less than of net sales and revenues in fiscal to of net sales and revenues in fiscal the company s net earnings in fiscal compared to a net loss in fiscal is primarily a result of grain feedstock prices in fiscal and increased expenses resulting from increased grain costs  in part from the company s grain futures contracts in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company restated its third quarter of fiscal results in order to apply a previously reported million pre tax gain on sale of equipment located at its portales  new mexico facility to a reduction in the cost basis of the portales plant 
this reduction in the cost basis of the portales plant mitigates potential future impairment losses by reducing the carrying value of the assets subject to impairment write down under accounting rules 
after the restatement  the third quarter of fiscal earnings were million instead of the million earnings originally reported 
income taxes the company has recognized income tax expense at the statutory federal rates  plus applicable state rates  for financial reporting purposes for substantially all pre tax earnings reported after june  and expects to continue to do so 
most of this tax expense will be in the form of increased deferred tax liabilities as opposed to currently payable obligations 
as of june   the company s deferred tax liabilities were approximately million 
for financial reporting purposes  these deferred liabilities have been offset by deferred tax assets of approximately million  including net operating loss nol carryforwards and various tax credit carryforwards 
the deferred liabilities are not subject to expiration  but the offsetting deferred assets are subject to expiration at various future dates 
certain of these deferred tax assets have been reserved with a million allowance  leaving approximately million of net deferred tax liabilities on the company s balance sheet at june  the reserve covers portions of federal and state operating loss carryforwards  small ethanol producer tax credits and nebraska state investment tax credits in excess of amounts expected to be utilized 
in the past  the company has considered tax planning strategies intended to preserve as much of the deferred tax assets as possible  however  at june   no tax planning strategies were in place 
during the fiscal years ending june   and  the company recognized additional tax expenses from providing allowances on the assets expected to expire 
at june   the company has substantial deferred tax assets subject to expiration  for which allowances have not been provided 
when  based on available evidence and management estimates  it becomes more likely than not that amounts of deferred tax assets will expire before the benefit is realized  additional allowances will be necessary resulting in the company recognizing tax expenses in amounts in excess of the statutory federal rates  plus state rates 
see note to the financial statements for additional information  including scheduled expiration dates of the company s deferred tax assets 
if changes in the stock ownership of the company cause the company to undergo an ownership change as broadly defined in section of the internal revenue code a section event  utilization of the company s tax credit and nol carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation 
the company does not expect this annual limitation to necessarily limit the total tax carryforwards ultimately utilized in the future 
however  this annual limitation could defer the timing of these tax benefits 
the company does not believe that a section event has occurred during the last three fiscal years 
however  application of the complex provisions of section may be subject to differing interpretations by taxing authorities 
the company has no current plans  which would be expected to result in a section event in the immediate future 
however  large purchases of the company s stock by a single stockholder could create a section event over which the company has no control 
seasonality historically  the company generates higher gross profits during the second and third fiscal quarters october through march of each fiscal year 
this is due to production efficiencies experienced during the cooler months of the year and the traditional decrease in grain feedstock prices during and shortly following the autumn grain harvest 
historically demand and average selling prices for ethanol are higher during the winter months due to federal  state and local governments oxygenate programs 
however  during the first and second quarters of fiscal  gross profits were lower than anticipated due to lower than normal average sale prices of ethanol 
this was initially due to low oil and unleaded gasoline prices seen from july through february coupled with a lag in ethanol responding to increasing gasoline prices in early fiscal since fuel ethanol replaces gasoline  ethanol pricing has historically followed gasoline price trends 
with gasoline prices achieving near year highs  ethanol prices rebounded in the third quarter  and remained atypically strong in the fourth quarter of fiscal with some analysts predicting to per barrel oil and current ethanol market fundamentals it makes ethanol an ideal gasoline extender 
in light of these factors  management anticipates strong ethanol prices throughout the first quarter of fiscal  which is typically a period of depressed prices  leading into the typically strong oxygenate season that extends through the second and third quarters 
however  the legislative issues regarding mtbe and or rfg ii or significant changes in gasoline prices discussed earlier could have adverse affect on the long term ethanol demand and price 
liquidity and capital resources the company obtained funds during the last three fiscal years from several sources  including cash from operations  exercise of stock options  and proceeds from various credit facilities 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in fiscal earnings plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  deferred income tax expense  and the write down of portales  new mexico facility generated cash flows of approximately million 
in addition to the earnings and non cash charges  receipts from notes receivable and increased accounts payable contributed approximately million to cash flows from operating activities 
these increases were offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
cash provided by operating activities was used to upgrade the company s facilities  approximately million was reinvested in plant equipment and upgrades 
an additional million  of the cash flow  was applied to debt and capital leases 
in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities amounted to approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately million as of june   compared to million as of june   and million as of june  as of june   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to negative working capital of approximately million as of june   and negative working capital of million as of june  the fiscal working capital increase was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents  and accounts payable coupled with a decrease in revolving lines of credit 
liquidity risks have been partially mitigated by the refinancing of the company s credit facilities  during fiscal in december  the company was able to refinance its revolving and reducing lines of credit with a bank 
the bank provided the company with a line of credit of up to million and million of term debt 
the facilities carry interest rate alternatives equal to the bank s prime rate or a rate based on libor rate  whichever the company elects  plus a premium 
the credit facilities have a term of five years 
the company s financing agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  fulfill certain net worth and indebtedness tests  and limit the company s capital expenditures 
at june   the company was in compliance with all the covenants 
the company used the loan proceeds of million to extinguish its existing million revolving lines of credit  pay loan origination and closing cost of approximately million  and strengthen its working capital and liquidity situation 
at august   the company s million line of credit was fully available and undrawn 
the company believes it has the liquidity and borrowing capacity to sustain normal cyclical downturns because of its current financing arrangements 
however  should the company experience an increase in the cost of its feedstocks  a decrease in the demand for ethanol or related oxygenates  or if instability in the oil markets results in decreased prices for gasoline  for a sustained period of time then the company s liquidity and cash reserves could be inadequate 
if any of these events should occur and cash reserves proved insufficient  the company would have to seek additional funding through additional financing  sale of stock  or the sale of assets 
capital expenditures amounted to approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  approximately million and million of the capital expenditures were for process plant equipment at the colwich  kansas and york  nebraska facilities  respectively  with the balance split between the corporate office and portales  new mexico facility 
in fiscal  approximately million of the capital expenditures were for modifications to the york  nebraska facility  with the balance split between the colwich  kansas and portales  new mexico plants 
in fiscal  approximately million of the capital expenditures were related to the acquisition and refurbishment of the portales  new mexico facility 
of the remaining balance of fiscal expenditures approximately million was related to modifications and upgrades at the york  nebraska facility 
the company has approximately million committed to acquire capital assets as of june  these capital commitments are primarily for modifications to the process plant equipment at the colwich  kansas facility 
in addition to the commitments  the company is evaluating plans to increase production capacity at both its colwich  kansas and york  nebraska facilities 
at this time no decision has been reached regarding the expansion of either facility 
also as previously disclosed in various press releases and other communications  the company is contemplating the addition of a glycerol side stream recovery system at its colwich  kansas facility 
the company is currently in the pilot plant study phase of the project  if the pilot plant yields the anticipated results the company plans to move forward with the fabrication of the recovery system 
at this time the company believes the recovery system would cost approximately million plus start up costs 
item a
