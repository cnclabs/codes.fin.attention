source of revenues and revenue recognition policy we generate revenues through software licenses  services and maintenance 
software licenses revenues are generated from licensing the rights to use our products 
services and maintenance revenues are generated from sales of customer support services contracts and consulting and training services performed for customers that license our products 
revenues from the sale of software licenses are recognized upon shipment of software when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is typically based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established by authorized management  will not change before market introduction 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  upgrades  enhancements  customer support services  or consulting services 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
revenues from maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the customer support contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to the installation of our software products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fee revenues are recognized on shipment of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and the software is not subject to acceptance criteria 
our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition

investing activities used cash of million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march   for the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities provided cash of million for the fiscal year ended march  due primarily to the proceeds from the sale of common stock from the company s initial public offering 
financing activities provided cash of  for the fiscal year ended march   which represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by offering costs paid in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses 
operating expenses will consume a material amount of our cash resources  including a portion of the net proceeds of the public offering 
we believe that the net proceeds of the public offering  together with our existing cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
year to date we have not experienced any material problems attributable to the inability to recognize dates beginning with the year in our software products  services  or internal systems 
based on our current assessment  we believe the current versions of our software products are year compliant  that is  they are capable of adequately distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
although we have passed the rollover from december  to january   we still face risks to the extent that products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving sophisticated hardware and complex software products that we cannot adequately evaluate for year compliance 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with our year compliance efforts  except for compensation expense associated with our salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to our year assessment and remediation efforts 
although we have not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding involving our products or services related to year compliance issues  we may in the future be required to defend our products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability we have for year related damages  including consequential damages  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
year issues did cause a delay in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase our products or services  our business  financial condition and operating results have not at this point been materially adversely affected 
factors affecting operating results our future operating results are uncertain and likely to fluctuate 
our operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  our operating results may not follow any past trends 
it is particularly difficult to predict the timing or amount of our license revenues because 
our sales cycles are lengthy and variable  typically ranging between six to nine months from our initial contact with a potential customer to the signing of a license agreement  although occasionally sales require substantially more time  
the amount of unfulfilled orders for our products at the beginning of a quarter is small because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  and 
we recognize a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter  and often in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
nevertheless  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because many of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
to the extent these expenses are not followed by increased revenues  our operating results will suffer 
our results fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the software industry has experienced significant downturns  particularly when general economic conditions decline and spending on management information systems decreases 
our business  financial condition and operating results may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a consequence of general economic conditions in the software industry 
in addition  the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our customers can cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
as a result of all of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful  and you should not rely on such comparisons to predict our future performance 
fluctuations in our operating results  particularly compared to the expectations of market analysts or investors  could cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
we have a limited operating history 
we commenced operations on april  and commercially released the initial version of coredossier in november accordingly  we have a limited operating history  and we face all of the risks and uncertainties encountered by early stage companies 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
the new and evolving nature of the electronic compliance market increases these risks and uncertainties 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to our product development  sales and marketing  and customer support 
as a result  we will need to generate significant quarterly revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
our business strategies may not be successful  and we may not be profitable in any future period 
we may be unable to expand our sales and support infrastructure 
to date  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force and have supported our customers with our consulting and customer support staff 
our future revenue growth will depend in large part on recruiting and training additional direct sales  consulting and customer support personnel 
we have not experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and support personnel 
we may not be able to successfully expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels and any such expansion may not result in increased revenues 
if we are unable to hire highly trained consulting and customer support personnel  we may be unable to meet customer demands 
our business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected if we fail to expand our direct sales force or our technical and customer support staff 
we have historically sold most of our products and services to businesses in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry 
we have recently begun selling our products and services to industries requiring robust publishing initiatives 
our business strategy includes targeting applications that are document intense publishing operations including bids and proposed management of large documents  and others 
we may not experience the same level of sales in other industries as in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry 
if we are unable to adequately address these factors we may not successfully market and sell our products and services in these targeted industries 
consequently  we may not generate revenues 
in addition  as we develop new industry specific products  we may begin competing with companies we have not competed against in the past 
these companies may have greater experience and expertise in these industries 
if we are unable to compete successfully against these new competitors our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we depend on certain key employees 
our future performance will also largely depend on the efforts and abilities of our key technical  customer support  sales and managerial personnel and on our ability to retain them 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain such personnel in the future 
in addition  the loss of any of our executive officers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our market is subject to rapid technological change 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change 
existing products become obsolete and unmarketable when products using new technologies are introduced and new industry standards emerge 
for example  we may need to modify our products when third parties change software that we integrate into our products 
as a result  the lifecycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
to be successful  we must continue to enhance our current product line and develop new products that successfully respond to such developments 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected if we delay release of our products and product enhancements or if these products and product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released 
we face risks from expansion of our international operations 
we intend to expand our international operations and may enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for coredossier 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities  but we may do so in the future 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on service revenues 
support and service revenues represented of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues for fiscal we anticipate that service revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenues 
because service revenues have lower gross margins than license revenues  a continued increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by service revenues resulting from increased services and maintenance revenues or a decrease in license revenues could have a detrimental impact on overall gross margins and our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of march
