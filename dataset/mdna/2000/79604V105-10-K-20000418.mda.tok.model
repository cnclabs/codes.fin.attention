the company believes that disclosure of its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda provides useful information regarding the company s ability to incur and service debt  but that it should not be considered a substitute for operating income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
other companies may calculate ebitda in a different manner than the company 
ebitda does not take into consideration substantial costs and cash flows of doing business  such as interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization  and should not be considered in isolation to or as a substitute for other measures of performance 
ebitda does not represent funds available for discretionary use by the company because those funds are required for debt service  capital expenditures to replace fixed assets  working capital  and other commitments and contingencies 
ebitda is not an accounting term and is not used in generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda  as calculated by the company  also excludes extraordinary items  discontinued operations  and minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries

as adjusted for the aggregate of these items of other income expense  ebitda for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
ebitda for fiscal reflects a reduction of million for negative production variances incurred during the last half of fiscal year compliance the year issue results from many computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define a year 
as a result  a computer program that has date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company utilizes computer software  hardware  information and non information systems throughout its worldwide operations in performing financial  manufacturing and distribution functions 
additionally  the company interfaces with third party business partners using such systems 
the company did not experience a disruption to its business activities as the result of year problems 
while we continue to monitor electronic data received from third parties and generated internally as part of our routine business practices  as of march   our efforts regarding year were substantially complete 
there can be no assurance that the company or one of the entities it does business with will not experience a year problem that could have an effect on the company 
conversion to the euro on january   eleven countries in europe adopted a common currency  the euro and exchange rates between the currencies of the eleven countries were fixed against the new euro 
the former currencies of those eleven countries will remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until january  and goods and services may be paid for using either the euro or the former currency until that time 
approximately of samsonite europe s sales are within these eleven countries 
the euro conversion has a significant impact on the company s operations in terms of pricing policies  currency risk and exchange  information systems  and financial reporting 
samsonite europe has been addressing euro implementation issues since fiscal and has formed two different project teams to address euro issues one to address competitive and marketing issues and another to address administrative  financial and computer systems issues 
the company believes the adoption of the euro will have a positive effect on samsonite europe s operations 
having a common currency among many of the countries that samsonite europe sells into will reduce the administrative burden of multiple currencies as well as reduce the costs of hedging and exchanging currencies and resulting exchange gains and losses 
as the euro becomes accepted in the international money markets  samsonite europe may also reduce its currency risk against the us dollar for purchases of goods in the far east by using the euro to pay for such purchases rather than the us dollar  which is currently the primary currency used in international trade 
because of the weakness in the euro since its adoption  the company has not begun to use the euro for such purchases and does not expect this to occur within fiscal year samsonite europe has adjusted its wholesale pricing to reduce product pricing differences between countries which have existed historically  however  price variations between countries will continue to exist at the retail level due to differences in transportation costs  value added tax rates  and dealer margins in the various european countries 
because of samsonite europe s strong competitive position throughout the countries participating in the euro conversion and significant economic barriers to entry  the company does not believe that potential increased competition and price transparency as a result of the euro will have an adverse effect on the company s sales or results of operations 
samsonite europe currently intends to continue using the belgian franc as its functional currency until its fiscal year beginning january  as of december   samsonite europe s information systems have been modified such that order entry  customer invoicing  and payment processing can be accomplished in the former currency or the euro  while converting financial reporting to the functional currency the belgian franc 
additional extensive system modifications are necessary to convert the functional currency to the euro 
the target completion date for such modifications  which are being accomplished using existing internal staffing  is june  most system modifications to date have also been accomplished using internal staffing with minimal incremental costs incurred to date 
the company estimates that it has incurred incremental costs through january  of approximately  to implement the euro conversion and estimates that it will spend a total of approximately  to fully implement its euro conversion 
these cost estimates do not include costs of existing internal staff who have devoted time to the euro conversion 
all costs related to the euro conversion have been charged to expense 
effect of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies under the standard for hedge accounting 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s primary market risks include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company enters into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates with major financial institutions 
from time to time  the company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
the company does not use financial instruments to manage changes in commodity prices 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange contracts the company enters into forward foreign exchange and option contracts to reduce its economic exposure to translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries primarily the translated earnings of european operations which report earnings in belgian francs  intercompany royalty payments from foreign subsidiaries  and certain third party royalty payments receivable in japanese yen 
the company s european subsidiary enters into forward exchange contracts primarily to reduce its economic exposure to purchases of goods from the far east payable in us dollars and certain other contracts to reduce its economic exposure to receipts payable in various european currencies 
contracts entered into to reduce the company s exposure to translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and intercompany royalties are marked to market at the end of each month and gains or losses are included in other income expense net 
gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts entered into to reduce the company s exposure third party royalty payments  product purchases  and receipts are included in income or loss when the contracts are closed 
at january   the company and its european subsidiary had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding having a total contract amount of approximately million with a weighted average maturity of days 
if there were a ten percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the outstanding forward exchange contracts  the loss in earnings from the amount included in results of operations for the year ended january  would be approximately million  before the effect of income taxes 
any hypothetical loss in earnings would be offset by changes in the underlying value of translated earnings or royalty income  to the extent such earnings or income is equal to the amount of currency exposed  or for product purchases by exchange gains 
interest rates at january   the company had approximately million of fixed rate long term debt including current maturities 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  among other factors including credit ratings  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt including current portion at january  was million  which was less than the carrying value by million 
fair values were determined primarily from quoted market rates since almost all the fixed rate long term debt at january  consists of the company s outstanding publicly traded subordinated notes 
a decrease from prevailing interest rates at january   would result in an estimated increase in fair value of total fixed rate long term debt of approximately million 
at january   the company had an outstanding variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a pay rate of  and a receive rate of 
the swap agreement dated november  has a two year term and can be canceled by either party to the swap after one year 
the receive rate reprices every three months
