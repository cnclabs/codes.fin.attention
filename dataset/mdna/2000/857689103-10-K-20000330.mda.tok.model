results of operations the following table highlights the results of operations for the company dollars in thousands fiscal twelve nine fiscal year months months year ended ended transition ended ended december  december  period december  march  unaudited unaudited net revenues total      nevada operations a      missouri operations a      other a      operating income loss total      nevada operations a      missouri operations a      other a      cash flows from operating activities      ebitda  as adjusted b total      nevada operations a      missouri operations a      other a      ebitda  as adjusted b  adjusted for the sunset equipment lease total      nevada operations a      a the nevada operations include the accounts of palace station  boulder station  texas station and sunset station 
the missouri operations include the accounts of station casino st 
charles and station casino kansas city 
other includes the operations of wild wild west  which opened in july  the company s investment in barley s  southwest gaming and corporate expense 
b ebitda  as adjusted consists of operating income plus depreciation  amortization  preopening expenses and impairment loss 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  ebitda  as adjusted is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing the operating performance of the company 
together with net income and cash flows  ebitda  as adjusted provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service debt and incur capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebitda  as adjusted and the trends it depicts  the components should be considered 
the impact of interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  preopening expenses and impairment loss  each of which can significantly affect the company s results of operations and liquidity and should be considered in evaluating the company s operating performance  cannot be determined from ebitda  as adjusted 
further  ebitda  as adjusted does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and does not necessarily indicate cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  it should be noted that not all gaming companies that report ebitda or adjustments to such measures may calculate ebitda  or such adjustments in the same manner as the company  and therefore  the company s measure of ebitda  as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other gaming companies 
consolidated net revenues  cash flows from operating activities  and ebitda  as adjusted for the fiscal year ended december  increased as compared to the transition period these increases are due to the transition period consisting of nine months as compared to the fiscal year ended december   which is twelve months 
the above table presents certain results of operations from the unaudited twelve month period ended december  for comparison purposes 
consolidated net revenues  operating income  cash flows from operating activities and ebitda  as adjusted for the transition period decreased as compared to the fiscal year ended march  these decreases are due to the transition period consisting of nine months as compared to the fiscal year ended march   which is twelve months 
the above table presents certain results of operations from the unaudited nine month period ended december  for comparison purposes 
consolidated net revenues the increase in consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  is due to increased revenues at all of the company s properties 
increased revenues at the nevada operations are partially a result of the completed master planned expansions at texas station and sunset station  which were completed in february and november  respectively 
in addition  revenues at the nevada operations increased due to the introduction of the boarding pass player rewards program in april  which makes it more convenient for customers to redeem points earned from gaming activity at any of the nevada properties 
net revenues at the missouri operations increased primarily due to station casino kansas city which generated a increase in net revenues 
consolidated net revenues increased for the transition period as compared to the nine months ended december  due to increased revenues from the nevada properties generally  and results from sunset station  which opened in june  are included for only seven months in the nine months ended december  also  revenues from the station casino kansas city facility continued to steadily improve 
net revenues at station casino st 
charles declined as a result of significant competition in the st 
louis market 
operating income operating margin the company s operating income was impacted by certain charges in each of the above periods that affect the ability to analyze year to year comparisons

the increases at the nevada properties are attributed to the same factors affecting consolidated net revenues discussed above and the increases at the missouri properties are primarily attributed to a increase in operating income  excluding certain charges  at station casino kansas city due to a significant improvement in operations at this property 
in addition  the decline in the prior year at station casino st 
charles was reversed as the property posted a million increase in operating income  excluding certain charges 
the consolidated operating margin  excluding certain charges  improved in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   due to the operating margins at sunset station and station casino kansas city improving over basis points and smaller increases at all of the other properties 
operating margin  excluding certain charges  improved in the transition period as compared to the fiscal year ended march  primarily as a result of significantly improved operations at station casino kansas city

the casino profit margin increased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the twelve months ended december  with all properties improving their margin with the exception of boulder station which decreased slightly 
casino profit margin for the transition period remained relatively consistent with results for the nine months ended december  food and beverage 
food and beverage revenues for the fiscal year ended december  increased over food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to the completion of the expansion projects at sunset station and texas station 
these increases in food and beverage revenues in nevada were offset by decreases at the missouri properties 
also  food and beverage revenues increased due to selected menu price increases  which were offset by a decrease in food covers at all of the properties 
food and beverage net profit margins increased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the twelve months ended december  food and beverage revenues for the transition period increased over food and beverage revenues for the nine months ended december  the primary reason for this increase is the results from sunset station  which opened in june  are included for only seven months in the nine months ended december  the increase in food and beverage revenues is less than the overall increase in revenues 
this is primarily due to a decline in food and beverage revenues at station casino kansas city 
in the prior year s period  the company was very aggressive in promoting station casino kansas city s food operations 
food and beverage net profit margins improved to for the transition period  from in the nine months ended december  this increase in margin is due to improvement at the company s nevada operations  primarily as a result of continued focus on cost control  as well as selected menu price increases 
room 
room revenues for the fiscal year ended december  increased over room revenues for the twelve months ended december  the primary reason for this increase is the opening of the wild wild west gambling hall hotel in july  which contributed million of room revenues in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to million of room revenues in the twelve months ended december  the company wide room occupancy decreased to in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to in the twelve months ended december  due to the company increasing room rates at the properties 
the average daily room rate increased to in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to in the twelve months ended december  room revenues for the transition period increased over room revenues for the nine months ended december  the primary reason for this increase is the results from sunset station  which opened in june  are included for only seven months in the nine months ended december  additionally  the company opened the wild wild west gambling hall hotel in july  which contributed million of room revenues in the transition period offsetting these increases was a decline in room revenues at palace station and boulder station 
these declines were primarily a result of a lower average daily room rate

as a percent of net revenues  sg a decreased to in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to in the twelve months ended december  as a percent of net revenues  sg a decreased to in the transition period as compared to in the nine months ended december  these decreases are due primarily to the fine tuning of operations at sunset station and station casino kansas city 
in the company s experience  when a new property opens  sg a as a percent of net revenues is higher than normal  and reduces as the property s operations mature 
also  due to the fixed cost nature of some of these expenses  they decrease on a percentage basis as the company continues to increase revenue 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to in the twelve months ended december  the company has increased its corporate infrastructure as it continues to lay the foundation for future growth 
corporate expenses as a percent of net revenues for the transition period were consistent with the nine months ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million in the fiscal year ended december  to million as compared to million in the twelve months ended december  this increase is due to the completion of the expansion projects at sunset station and texas station which were completed in november and february  respectively 
this increase was offset by decreases at boulder station and station casino st 
charles as a portion of the original equipment became fully depreciated during the fiscal year ended december   as both properties have been open for five years 
in addition  palace station had a large purchase of slot machines in that became fully depreciated during the fiscal year ended december  depreciation at station casino st 
charles should also decline going forward  due to the write off of assets noted below  while depreciation at sunset station should increase due to the purchase of various equipment leases in depreciation and amortization increased million in the transition period to million as compared to million in the nine months ended december  this increase is due to the results of sunset station being included for only seven months in the nine months ended december  impairment loss 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company recorded an impairment loss of million in the fiscal year ended december  and million in the transition period to adjust the carrying value of its fixed assets and land held for development to their estimated fair value 
in the fiscal year ended december   approximately million of the impairment loss was related to station casino st 
charles 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made a decision to reconfigure the existing station casino st 
charles facility to a more efficient layout in response to the new open boarding rules promulgated by the missouri gaming commission that began in september in the st 
louis market 
all gaming operations will be moved to the existing barge by the end of the first quarter of the existing riverboat is expected to be sold after the reconfiguration is complete 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the riverboat and miscellaneous other fixed assets were written down by approximately million to their net realizable value 
in addition  the company performed an evaluation of the carrying values of the remaining assets in st 
charles and determined a million write down of the asset values was necessary 
the write down was deemed appropriate after a review of the property s asset valuations relative to the company s near term investment objectives 
the balance of the impairment loss in the fiscal year ended december   resulted primarily from the company s determination that it will sell a acre parcel of land in henderson  nevada  that it recently acquired 
future development of the property will be limited to non gaming purposes 
the resulting write down of the parcel was necessary to reflect the value of the land as a non gaming site 
in the transition period  the impairment loss principally involves assets at the station casino st 
charles facility  including a riverboat formerly used in the missouri operations  capitalized project costs associated with various parcels of land determined to have no value  and several parcels of land within close proximity to the st 
charles  missouri site that were being held for future development 
the fair value of the impaired assets was primarily determined through the market s interest in riverboats and barges  and on the comparable sales prices on parcels of land in the st 
charles area 
the total amount of the impairment loss in the transition period related to this category of assets was approximately million 
in addition to the assets described above  the most significant portion of the remaining impairment loss in the transition period relates to several parcels of land in nevada and texas that the company had acquired in the past for either defensive or expansion purposes 
the value of these parcels was determined based on sales prices for comparable parcels of land on the market 
the following two circumstances led to the company s decision to write down these assets to their fair market value the passage  in nevada  of legislation which places significantly higher requirements on land to be zoned for gaming purposes  and the termination of the plan of merger with crescent real estate equities company see part i 
item legal proceedings settlement of crescent litigation 
included in other assets  net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   is million related primarily to parcels of land 
the company is actively attempting to dispose of these non strategic assets and expects to complete the sale of certain of these assets in the first half of calendar year preopening expenses 
prior to december   the company capitalized preopening expenses associated with its construction projects  including sunset station  which opened in june such amounts were expensed upon the opening of the related project 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company expensed preopening expenses of million related primarily to this project 
preopening expenses incurred after january  will be expensed as incurred 
interest expense  net 
interest costs incurred expensed and capitalized decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to million in the twelve months ended december  this decrease is due to a decline of million in total long term debt from the prior year and to a reduction in average interest rates on long term debt to from in the prior year 
interest costs incurred expensed and capitalized for the transition period of million remained consistent with interest costs incurred for the nine months ended december  of million 
other income expense 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december   the company wrote off million of costs incurred related to the termination of the flamingo hilton kansas city acquisition 
the acquisition was terminated when the missouri gaming commission the commission informed the company that it would not be able to complete its licensing investigation on or before the termination date set forth in the acquisition agreement 
the company believes the commission was unable to complete its licensing investigation in the required time frame because of the investigation of the actions of an attorney who worked on the company s legal matters in missouri see regulation and licensing missouri gaming regulations 
in april  the company received a million settlement payment from crescent real estate equities  inc  which is included in the merger settlement  net of related legal costs line on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations see part i

liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended december   the company generated cash flows from operating activities of million 
at december   the company had total available borrowings of million under the amended bank facility  of which million was directly outstanding and million was reserved for the potential payment of an outstanding letter of credit 
total available borrowings will reduce beginning march  and each quarter thereafter in accordance with the terms of the amended bank facility see description of certain indebtedness and capital stock amended bank facility 
the company also had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   total capital expenditures were approximately million  of which approximately i million was associated with the purchase of equipment previously under operating leases at sunset station  ii million was associated with the expansion project at texas station  iii million was for maintenance capital expenditures  and iv million was associated with various other projects 
the company s primary capital requirements during fiscal year are expected to include i another expansion project at texas station  estimated to cost approximately million  ii equity contributions to the proposed green valley ranch project expected to be approximately million  iii strategic land purchases throughout the las vegas area  iv opportunistic repurchases of the company s common stock  v maintenance capital expenditures  and vi principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
the company believes that cash flows from operations  borrowings under the amended bank facility  vendor and lease financing of equipment  and existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy the company s anticipated uses of capital during fiscal year the company  however  continually is evaluating its financing needs 
if more attractive financing alternatives or expansion  development or acquisition opportunities become available to the company  the company may amend its financing plans assuming such financing would be permitted under its existing debt agreements see description of certain indebtedness and capital stock and other applicable agreements 
future development green valley project a joint venture between the company and gcr gaming  llc has proposed to build a new resort casino in henderson  nevada 
construction is expected to commence during the third quarter of and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of the estimated construction cost of this project is to million 
the project is expected to be funded with total equity contributions from the partners of approximately million and third party financing for the remainder 
if third party financing cannot be obtained or is insufficient to fund the construction costs  the company and gcr gaming  llc would be obligated to contribute amounts necessary to finance the construction and opening of the project 
land acquisition in addition to the green valley project  the company has purchased or has options to purchase an additional acres of land for two additional gaming sites in the las vegas valley which will be used for future development 
the rhodes ranch site consists of two parcels totaling acres  located at the intersection of durango road and the southern beltway i located in the southwest quadrant of las vegas 
the boulder tropicana site is a acre site consisting of two parcels at the intersection of boulder highway and tropicana avenue in eastern las vegas 
the company is leasing with an option to purchase acres of the site and has entered into an option to purchase the adjacent acre parcel 
the company paid million for the land mentioned above and will make combined lease and option payments of million per year 
the company has no immediate plans to develop these sites 
the company s capital requirements in could also include amounts necessary to fund the proposed development of the project with the united auburn indian community to the extent development of such project is commenced in in addition  the company has in the past  and may in the future  make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures on an opportunistic basis 
while the company has not entered into any agreement with respect to any such future acquisition or joint venture other than as disclosed in this report  the company s capital requirements in may include amounts necessary to permit the company to pursue such expansion activities 
year readiness the company did not encounter any year problems 
the total cost to the company of making the company s systems year compliant was approximately million 
the majority of this cost related to the acquisition of new computer hardware to replace the systems which were not year compliant and the purchase of new software to replace non compliant software 
these costs were capitalized and will be depreciated over their expected useful life 
to the extent existing hardware or software was replaced  the company recognized a loss currently for the undepreciated balance 
this loss is included in the above cost 
low water level at station casino st 
charles during december and january  the water level of the missouri river was well below normal 
in addition  over time silt and debris flowing downstream have built up under the gaming barges and other ancillary barges at station casino st 
charles 
these circumstances have caused a portion of these barges  at times  to touch the river bottom 
because these barges have touched the river bottom  the american bureau of shipping decertified the barges on january  as a result of the decertification  the missouri gaming commission expressed concern regarding the effect of the low water level on the barges 
however  based upon improvement in the water level and the company s agreement to work with the american bureau of shipping to re certify all of the barges at a time when the river levels permit  the missouri gaming commission allowed the gaming facility to remain open 
on november   the american bureau of shipping recertified the barges 
the company continues to monitor the situation very carefully and believes that the facility should remain in operation 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment will not change or that the relevant authorities will continue to permit the operation of the facility 
a prolonged closure of the facility as a result of the low water level would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
regulation and taxes the company is subject to extensive regulation by the nevada and missouri gaming authorities and will be subject to regulation  which may or may not be similar to that in nevada  by any other jurisdiction in which it may conduct gaming activities in the future 
changes in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
pursuant to legislation enacted in  a federal commission conducted a two year study of the gaming industry in the united states and reported its findings and recommendations to congress 
to date there have been no changes to existing laws or regulations as a result of this report 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues  particularly to the state of nevada and its counties and municipalities 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law  or in the administration of such law  affecting the gaming industry 
proposals in recent years that have not been enacted included a federal gaming tax and increases in state or local taxes  however  we have no assurances that future proposals  including a recent proposal in nevada  will not be enacted 
this recent proposal in nevada would increase the tax on gaming revenue from to 
if enacted  this proposal would have a material impact on the results of operations for the company 
management believes that the company s recorded tax balances are adequate 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results
