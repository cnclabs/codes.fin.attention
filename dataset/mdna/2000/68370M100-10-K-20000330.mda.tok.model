item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following financial data appear in thousands 
overview we are a leading provider of e business applications and software services that enable our customers to manage and deliver online content  engage in personalized online marketing and merchandizing campaigns and conduct commerce via a secure  reliable  flexible transaction processing and order management system 
we believe that the combination of these three enabling capabilities creates a cost efficient  rapidly deployable e business solution that provides a more engaging  personalized user experience 
our e business application suite is built on an open standards based architecture that is scalable and easily adaptable to the evolving business requirements of our customers 
we currently offer three principal products internet publishing system ips  our integrated publishing system that provides content management and the dynamic delivery of personalized information  transact  our comprehensive order management and transaction processing system  and shopsite  our web storefront building software for small and medium size businesses 
our products enable the delivery of content and commercial offers through a broad range of media  including web browsers and cell phones  personal digital assistants and other wireless devices 
since our inception  our business has principally focused on providing software solutions that enable businesses to engage in business to business and business to consumer commerce over the internet 
over the past three years  we made a series of acquisitions intended to complement our internet commerce functionality that we offer our customers 
in  we acquired waypoint software corporation  a provider of business to business catalog solutions  and folio corporation  a supplier of software publishing tools 
in  we acquired icentral incorporated  a provider of a browser based online store building tool targeted at small to medium size businesses 
in  we decided to focus on our core internet commerce business 
accordingly  in june  we formed a strategic relationship with nextpage and granted nextpage  for a three year period  exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the software publishing tools we acquired from folio 
this relationship allowed us to reduce our cost structure and provided us with minimum royalty payments from nextpage of  per quarter through june in connection with this agreement  we also received license fees from nextpage in the amount of  in exchange for granting nextpage a non exclusive worldwide right to market and distribute our commerce software products to the commercial publishing industry 
in october  we merged with futuretense  a provider of web site content management products 
the goal of this merger was to create a more complete internet commerce solution for our customers and to strengthen our competitive position 
we have accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from two sources license fees for the right to use our products and service revenues for technical support  consulting and training related to our products 
our license fees account for the majority of our revenues 
we recognize license fee revenues upon licensing and delivery of the software if there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  there are no significant post delivery obligations and customer acceptance is not required 
if the license is subject to customer acceptance or significant post delivery obligations  we defer the revenue recognition of the license fee until customer acceptance has occurred or the post delivery obligations have been met 
we execute separate contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license and maintenance arrangement and each professional services arrangement 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for the value of professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized 
we also enter into reseller arrangements for certain of our products that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based on a percentage of our list price 
we recognize these sublicense revenues from resellers when earned  either on a per unit basis or  for guaranteed minimums  upon shipment of the master copy of all our software to which the guaranteed sublicense fee minimums relate  if there are no significant post delivery obligations 
our service revenues derive from a wide variety of contracted services for technical support  consulting and training related to our products 
we charge fees for maintenance and customer support based on a percentage  generally to  of the corresponding license fee  and recognize these fees ratably over the life of the contract 
our maintenance agreements provide for product upgrades and enhancements and technical support in the form of telephone or on site assistance 
these agreements are renewable at the discretion of the customer 
accordingly  our maintenance and technical support revenues are typically a function of new product licenses and the annual renewal of maintenance agreements 
we also generate revenues from professional services  which include implementation and technical consulting  and from education services  including on site and online training services 
we recognize revenues from professional and education services as such services are performed 
we report our revenues according to three operating segments commerce  content and other 
our commerce revenues include license fees and service revenues from our transact  livecommerce and shopsite products 
our content revenues include license fees and service revenues from our internet publishing system  or ips 
for reporting purposes  we refer to the total of product and service revenues for both commerce and content as e business revenues 
the other revenues relate  historically  to license fees and service revenues generated from the software publishing tools acquired from folio and other products  certain of which have been discontinued 
after june  other revenues relate primarily to the royalties received from nextpage in accordance with our strategic arrangement 
our cost of product revenues consists of costs to distribute our products  including the cost of the media on which our products are delivered and royalty payments to third party vendors for technology that is incorporated into our products 
our cost of service revenues consists primarily of the salaries and related costs of our technical personnel 
software development costs that qualified to be capitalized were immaterial in all periods 
accordingly  we have charged all such expenses to research and development in the period incurred 
our customer base is diversified  with no single customer representing greater than of our total revenues for the years ended december   and results of operations revenues comparative percentage years ended december  changes to to commerce revenues    content revenues  e business revenues    other revenues    total revenues    in  total revenues grew by  with product and services revenues increasing by  and  respectively  compared to in  total revenues grew by  with product revenues declining by  and service revenues increasing by  compared to product revenues comparative percentage changes years ended december  to to commerce product revenues    content product revenues  e business revenues    other product revenues    total product revenues    in  total product revenues increased by  compared to our e business product revenues increased  principally due to increases in the number of product licenses entered into with new customers and follow on licenses with our installed base of customers 
in addition  in we recorded a full year of revenues from our content management product compared to approximately six months of revenues from that product in  since the product was introduced in july this increase was offset by the decline of  in other product revenues compared to this decline resulted from decreases in license revenues from our folio software publishing product tool 
in  total product revenues decreased by  compared to the increase in e business revenues of approximately  compared to was due principally to higher sales of our commerce products 
other product revenues decreased by  in compared to discontinuing the licensing of certain software products accounted for  of the reduction 
product revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that product revenues will continue to account for the majority of total revenues for the foreseeable future 
service revenues comparative percentage years ended december  changes to to commerce service revenues    content service revenues  e business revenues    other service revenues    total service revenues    in  e business service revenues increased by  compared to as a result of increased demand for our consulting and technical service offerings from both new and existing customers 
commerce service revenues grew  due to an increase in consulting projects  as well as an increase in maintenance and support revenues from our new and installed base of customers 
content service revenues increased significantly  primarily from the strength of new product license business 
our content product line is relatively new to the marketplace  and we anticipate growth in content service revenues as the volume of our content product revenues increase 
in  other service revenues declined by  compared to this decline was due to reductions in both consulting and maintenance and support revenues from our folio products 
we do not expect to derive any folio service revenues during the term of the agreement with nextpage 
in  total service revenues increased by  compared to the e business service revenues increased by  from  primarily as a result of a growing customer base and a developing service practice 
other service revenues increased by  compared to  primarily attributable to the increased business volume and improvements in the marketing and delivery of our service offerings 
for  and  service revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
cost of product revenues years ended december  cost of product revenues    percentage of total product revenues product gross margin in and  the increased cost of product revenues was attributable primarily to growth in product revenues and increased costs for third party licensing royalties related to our commerce products 
our content management products carry higher third party costs than our commerce products 
as a result  we believe that our cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues will be in the range of to for the foreseeable future  as we incorporate more third party technology into our products and continue to resell third party software products with our commerce and content solutions 
cost of service revenues years ended december  cost of service revenues    percentage of total service revenues service gross margin in  cost of service revenues increased by  from  primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  and outside consulting expenses of  during  we continued to increase the number of our professional services personnel and our use of outside consultants 
we expect that our service gross margin may decline slightly during the first six months of as a result of continued investment in the training of our system integrators 
in  cost of service revenues increased by  from  primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of  and outside consulting expenses of during  we continued to increase the number of our professional services personnel and our use of outside consultants 
in  service gross margin decreased approximately from  primarily due to an increase in professional services personnel and lower utilization rates resulting from extended training processes for new employees 
operating expenses years ended december  percentage of revenues selling and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    amortization of intangible assets    acquired in process research and development   restructuring charge  merger related costs  total operating expenses    selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the cost of sales and marketing personnel and outside consultants  as well as the costs associated with marketing programs  industry tradeshows  sales seminars  advertising and product literature 
in  selling and marketing expenses increased by  primarily as a result of an increase in commission expenses related to the increase in revenues 
in  selling and marketing expenses decreased  compared to the decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in employee related and travel expenses as a result of reductions in sales and marketing headcount throughout the year 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the cost of research and development personnel and independent contractors  certain licensed technology and equipment and facilities costs related to such activities 
in  research and development expenses decreased  compared to the decrease was attributable to reductions of  in employee related expenses and of in outside consulting expenses 
this reduction in research and development headcount primarily resulted from the completion of our modular version of transact that was released in the first quarter of in  research and development expenses decreased  compared to as a result of a reduction in both employee related expense and the use of outside technical consultants after completion of a number of technical projects during the year 
in addition  we implemented headcount reductions and realized other cost efficiencies from the consolidation of the research and development activities from the waypoint  folio and icentral acquisitions 
although research and development expenses have decreased in prior years  we believe that we will continue to devote substantial resources to our product development activities and that our expense levels  in absolute dollars  will increase slightly over the next year 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of finance  management and administrative personnel and legal and other professional fees 
in  general and administrative expenses decreased  from the decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease of  in bad debt expense and decreases related to travel expenses  professional fees and equipment rental 
general and administrative expenses in slightly increased over amortization of intangibles in  amortization of intangibles increased by from  as a result of recording a full year of amortization costs related to the icentral acquisition 
amortization costs increased by  in  as a result of recording a full year of amortization costs related to the folio and mission critical technologies acquisitions 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development expenses consisted of  relating to the icentral acquisition in  and   and  relating to the acquisitions of mission critical technologies  waypoint and folio  respectively  in these costs were expensed in the periods of the acquisitions and are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development related to projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that  until completion of development  had no alternative future use 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  restructuring charge to align our operating costs with our anticipated future revenue stream 
the major components of the restructuring charge were employee severance  benefits and related costs  write off of assets and termination of certain contractual obligations 
merger related costs we incurred one time costs related to our merger with futuretense of  these costs consisted of professional fees and other charges of  and costs to exit contractual obligations and asset impairments of non operating income expense interest income represents interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the decreases in interest income in and  as compared to the prior years  were attributable primarily to lower average investments in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as a result of increased funding of operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense relates to the interest charged on our line of credit and long term obligations 
interest expense increased in primarily due to the issuance of a  promissory note in connection with the folio acquisition in interest expense decreased in due mainly to the repayment of the promissory note 
other income expense primarily represents foreign currency translation gains and losses 
in  we also recorded a loss of approximately on an equity investment 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes of  and in  and  respectively 
this provision relates to the amount of estimated taxes due in foreign jurisdictions for our foreign operations and certain withholding taxes 
we incurred losses for us tax purposes for all periods to date and  accordingly  there has been no provision for us income taxes 
we believe that the provision for income taxes will fluctuate in the future and is dependent upon the geographical locations of future sales and the associated withholding taxes in those countries 
the provision for income taxes will also fluctuate when we become eligible for corporate income taxation in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of  from december  our operating activities used cash and cash equivalents of   and  during  and  respectively  to fund our operations 
in  our net loss decreased approximately to  from  in accounts receivable decreased in absolute dollars despite a growth in revenues  primarily as a result of the receipt of cash from revenue recorded in prior periods with extended terms as well as shorter average payment terms in new contracts 
in  our investing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of the primary source of cash from investing activities in was  related to the maturity of marketable securities  offset by the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  in and  we used cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
in  the principal uses of cash were  for purchases related to certain property and equipment and  for the purchase of marketable securities 
in  the principal uses of cash from investing activities were  related to the folio acquisition and the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  offset by the maturities of marketable securities worth  our financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of   and  during  and  respectively 
in  cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities consisted of  related to the sale of redeemable preferred stock and  from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
these were offset by the repayment of a  note payable in connection with the folio acquisition 
in  we received proceeds of  from intel and  from cmg information services  inc  and capital ventures international from the issuance of common stock 
in addition  we received proceeds of  from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and  from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
also in  we repaid  of the note payable issued in connection with the folio acquisition with a cash payment of  and an issuance of our common stock having a value of  in  the principal source of cash provided by financing activities was net borrowings of  against our line of credit 
in july  we obtained a  mortgage loan  on a provo  utah  building  which bears interest at the fixed rate of 
the mortgage principal payments are based upon a year term with a balloon payment of  due on june  we have an unsecured credit facility arrangement with a bank which provides up to  in financing in the form of a demand line of credit 
borrowings under this line are limited to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and of eligible foreign accounts receivable  as defined  and bear interest at the prime lending rate  which was at december  we are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants under this agreement and the line is collateralized by our accounts receivable 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  during  we decreased our borrowings under this facility to  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  these losses are available to reduce federal and state taxable income  if any  in future years 
these losses are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period that are in excess of 
while we believe that we have experienced a change in ownership in excess of  we do not believe that this change in ownership will significantly impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that our existing capital resources are adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the eu s common currency  the euro 
the former currencies of the participating countries are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until january   when the euro will be adopted as the sole legal currency 
we continue to assess the impact that the conversion to the euro will have on our european operations 
we are evaluating the potential impact in several areas of our business  including the ability of our information systems to handle euro denominated transactions and the impact on exchange costs and currency exchange rate risks 
we are also evaluating the impact that cross border price transparencies  which may affect the ability to price products differently in various countries  will have on our gross margin 
although we are still in the assessment phase  the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
year impact we have not experienced any significant problems with our computer systems or software products relating to distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates  generally referred to as year problems 
we are also not aware of any material year problems with our clients or vendors 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of year problems 
certain factors that may affect future results introduction this annual report contains certain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements we have used that are not statements of historical fact may be considered forward looking statements 
we have used believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and those presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our operating results to differ materially or adversely are discussed below 
we have a history of significant losses and these losses may continue in the future  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline we have experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period since our inception and these operating losses may continue in the future 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to make significant investments to broaden the range of our product offerings and expand our sales and marketing and technical personnel 
these efforts will require significant capital expenditures  a substantial portion of which we will make long before any corresponding revenue may be realized 
we may never achieve profitability  and if we do achieve profitability in any period  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our operating results are largely dependent upon the continued development and growth of internet commerce the market for our internet products and services has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and has an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced and developed products and services for internet commerce that compete with ours 
our future operating results depend upon the development and growth of the market for internet based packaged software applications  including electronic commerce applications 
the widespread acceptance of the internet as a sales  marketing  order receipt and processing medium is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
the following critical issues remain unresolved and may impact the growth of internet commerce security  reliability  ease of use  service  and government regulation 
if the internet commerce market fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected  our business and prospects will suffer 
the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and makes quarterly results difficult to predict the licensing of our products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by our prospective customers and we are often required to provide a significant level of education to them regarding the use and benefits of our products 
this process can be time consuming 
the lengthy delays associated with the sales cycle affect the timing of our revenue recognition and make it difficult to predict our quarterly results 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters  the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
if we fail to maintain and strengthen our relationships with systems integrators  we may not achieve expected revenue growth our prospective customers often rely on third party systems integrators to develop  deploy and manage their integrated e business solutions 
a substantial portion of our revenues are influenced by systems integrators that either incorporate our products into their solution for the prospective customer or otherwise recommend our product as an independent solution 
if a significant number of these systems integrators adopt a different product or technology as part of their integrated solution instead of our products  we may not achieve expected revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that that our efforts to continue to expand indirect sales in this manner will be successful 
in addition  we cannot be sure that such systems integrators will be able to successfully support our products within their overall solutions  and our revenues may vary depending on their ability to offer such support 
if limitations on the online collection of profile information are imposed  the utility of the personalization functionality of our products would be limited and we may not attract a significant number of new customers one of the principal features of our products is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of online users to assist business managers in personalizing content and commercial offers to be displayed to specific online users 
the resistance of online users to providing personal data and any future laws and regulations prohibiting use of personal data gathered online without express consent or requiring businesses to notify their web site visitors of the possible dissemination of their personal data could limit the utility of our products 
these types of laws or regulations could heighten privacy concerns by requiring businesses to notify web site users that the data captured from them online may be used by marketing entities to direct product messages to them 
while we are not aware of any laws or regulations of this type currently in effect or in development in the united states  other countries and political entities  including the european union and its member states  have adopted legal requirements imposing restrictions on the collection  use and processing of personal data 
it is possible that similar legal requirements could be adopted in the united states 
if the privacy concerns of consumers are not adequately addressed  the effectiveness of our products could be impaired and we may not attract new customers and the revenues they represent 
if our products fail to adequately safeguard the security and privacy of customer transaction data  our reputation could be damaged  and we could lose existing and prospective customers and existing and potential revenues a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications has been the ability to securely transmit confidential information over the internet 
the concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet generally  and electronic commerce in particular 
in addition  internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to develop products that adequately protect our customers against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
we rely on certain encryption and authentication technology to provide secure transmission of confidential information 
we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect customer transaction data 
if any compromise or breach were to occur  it could damage our reputation and cause us to lose existing and prospective customers 
if we do not compete effectively  particularly against established participants with greater financial and other resources than ours  we will lose market share the market for e business applications is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
if we fail to compete successfully with current or future competitors  we may lose market share 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements continually change 
we expect competition in this market to persist and increase in the future 
our primary competition includes in house development efforts by prospective customers and other vendors of application software or application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and financial services  such as art technology group  broadvision  intershop  interworld  interwoven and vignette 
in addition  larger companies with much broader product offerings  such as ibm  microsoft and oracle  may bundle their products to discourage users from purchasing our products 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their product offerings more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer demands  develop greater resources to the marketing and sales of their product  pursue acquisition and other opportunities more readily and adapt more aggressive pricing policies 
in addition  competitors have established and  in the future  may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to market or enhance their products 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and are likely to result in price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our ability to develop  market and support our services depends on retaining our key senior management team and attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals in the internet industry our future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and their continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in a highly competitive market 
our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the e business software market depends in large part upon the skills of our development personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in our industry is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
in connection with our recent acquisition of futuretense  the founders and employees of that company received a substantial number of our shares of common stock and can sell these shares at substantial gains 
in many cases  these individuals could become financially independent through these sales  before the products of either company have fully matured into commercially deliverable products commanding reasonable market share 
additionally  start up and other companies will seek out these individuals due to the financial results they achieved for their investors 
under the circumstances  we face a difficult and significant task of motivating key personnel to stay committed to us 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and operating results may result in reduced profitability and cause the price of our common stock to decline we have experienced significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis 
we expect to continue experiencing significant fluctuations in our future quarterly and annual results of operations due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including the introduction of new products by us and our competitors  the variability and length of sales cycles associated with our product offerings  the market acceptance of  and demand for  our products  the pace of development of electronic commerce conducted on the internet  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products offered by us or our competitors  non renewal of service agreements  software defects and other product quality problems  the mix of products and services we sell  customer retention  the ability to collect payments from our customers on a timely basis  any changes in our pricing policies and or those of our competitors  changes in the level of operating expenses  and general economic conditions 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a significant portion of our expenses  such as leased real estate facilities  depreciation and personnel  is fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
if our revenues fall below our expectations  we would probably not be able to reduce our fixed or other expenses in sufficient time to respond to the shortfall 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
if we are unable to manage our planned rapid expansion effectively  we may incur increased costs and place too many demands upon our senior management team we have experienced significant growth over the past two years and we are pursuing a business plan that  if successfully implemented  will cause us to continue to expand rapidly over the next several years 
this expansion would occur both domestically and internationally  which would increase our operating complexity significantly 
our expansion would also require significant time commitments from our senior management team and severely restrict its ability to manage our existing business 
our success depends on our ability to manage this expansion and these demands effectively 
we will  among many other things  need to improve our business development capabilities  hire  train and manage an increasing number of highly skilled employees  and continually enhance our information  management and operational and financial systems 
our failure to manage our expansion effectively could increase our costs  adversely affect our relations with customers and strategic partners and adversely affect our revenues and operating margins 
we are susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations our international activities expose us to numerous additional risks 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues from sales outside north america 
we currently have seven offices in europe and asia 
a key component of our business strategy is to expand our international activities 
as we continue to expand internationally  we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls relating to encryption technology and other export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  cultural barriers  difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivables  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to establish additional foreign operations  expand international sales channel management and support  hire additional personnel  customize products for local markets and develop relationships with international distributors and systems integrators 
even if we are able to successfully expand our international operations  we cannot be certain that we will succeed in maintaining or expanding international market demand for our products 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights and we may be subject to infringement claims that could subject us to significant liability and divert the time and attention of our senior management we regard our products  services and technology as proprietary 
we attempt to protect them through a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights 
we have no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our market 
although we hold several us patents asserting claims relating to certain aspects or uses of electronic commerce software  we cannot be sure of the degree of intellectual property protection those patents will provide 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products  services or technology without authorization  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we also cannot assure you that third parties will not develop similar technology independently 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
in addition to licensing technologies from third parties  we are developing and acquiring additional proprietary intellectual property 
third parties may try to claim our products or services infringe their intellectual property 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  in which case we would have to cease selling  incorporating or using those products and services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property and expend substantial amounts of resources to redesign our products or services 
if we are forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or to redesign our products or services  our business and prospects would suffer 
we are dependent on third party technology and if we are unable to license this technology  or if defects in this technology exist  our product shipments could be delayed we rely in large part on technology that we license from third parties  including relational database management systems from oracle and application server software from netscape 
the licenses from these third parties may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we were to lose any of these technology licenses  we would have to cease selling our products that incorporate the licensed technology and expend substantial amounts of resources to redesign our products using equivalent technology  if available 
if we are forced to cease selling and to redesign our products  our business and prospects would suffer 
our products may contain defects which may prove costly and time consuming for us to correct sophisticated software products  such as those we develop and market  may contain errors or failures that become apparent when we introduce the products or when we provide an increased volume of services 
we cannot assure you that testing by us and our potential customers will detect all errors in our products prior to licensing or sale 
correcting such errors may result in loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs  any of which would adversely affect our business and our ability to market our products profitably 
if we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards  our products may become obsolete  and we would probably lose existing customers and be unable to attract new ones internet markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions and changing customer demands 
the introduction of new products or technologies could render our product offerings obsolete  reduce the cost of competing products or increase the number of products similar to those that we provide or plan to provide 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions and services to address our customers changing demands 
we may be required to make significant and ongoing investments in future periods in order to remain competitive 
further  we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions and services or lengthen our sales cycles 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
any material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
our failure to successfully design  develop  test and introduce new services  or the failure of our recently introduced services to achieve market acceptance  could prevent us from maintaining existing client relationships  gaining new clients or expanding our markets 
in such a case  we would not achieve our expected revenue growth 
if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of futuretense  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger we completed our acquisition of futuretense in october the integration of futuretense is a complex process and we are uncertain that the integration will be completed rapidly or that we will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
our successful integration of futuretense will require  among other things  integration of the sales and marketing groups of each entity and the integration of our product lines 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining both companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined business 
in addition  the process of combining both companies could negatively affect our employee morale and our ability to retain some of our key employees or could cause customers to delay or change orders for products as a result of uncertainty over the integration of our product lines 
we will need to overcome these issues in order to realize the benefits or synergies of the merger 
if we fail to successfully cross market our products and futuretense s products  we may not increase or maintain our customer base or our revenues we intend to offer the respective products and services historically offered by us and by futuretense to our collective customers 
futuretense s customers may have no interest in our products and services and our customers may have no interest in theirs 
the failure of our cross marketing efforts may diminish the benefits we realize from the futuretense merger 
in addition  we intend to develop new products and services that combine our knowledge and resources with those of futuretense 
we cannot assure you that these products or services will be developed or  if developed  will be successful or that we can successfully integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
as a result  we may not be able to increase or maintain our customer base 
the regulation of the internet is unsettled  and future regulations could adversely affect our operating costs and our ability to market products facilitating internet commerce the laws and regulations that apply to commerce and communication over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
such legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a commercial medium 
the united states congress has recently considered enacting internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union also recently enacted its own privacy regulations 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  telecommunications  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
existing and future export controls may delay the introduction of new products or limit our ability to distribute products outside of the united states due to the encryption technology contained in our products  our products are subject to export controls within the united states 
these export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  may delay the introduction of new products or limit our ability to distribute products outside the united states 
in addition  federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
also  various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have adopted laws relating to personal privacy issues that could limit our ability to distribute products in those countries 
our business may suffer if the internet infrastructure is unable to effectively support the growth in demand placed on it our success will depend  in large part  upon the maintenance of the internet infrastructure  such as reliable network backbones with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and the timely development of enabling products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services and improved content 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use and increased bandwidth requirements 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may have to spend considerable amounts to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure 
these outages and delays could impact the internet sites of web publishers using our products and services 
the imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold by our customers over the internet could have a negative effect on online commerce and  as a result  on demand for our products the imposition of new sales or other taxes could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally and  as a result  the demand for our products 
there is recent federal legislation that limits the imposition of state and local taxes on internet related sales 
in  the united states congress passed the internet tax freedom act  which places a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access  unless the tax was already imposed prior to october   and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce 
there is a possibility that congress may not renew this legislation in if congress chooses not to renew this legislation  state and local governments would be free to impose taxes on goods purchased over the internet 
in addition  one or more foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that engage in electronic commerce 
a successful assertion by one or more foreign countries that companies engaged in electronic commerce should collect sales or other taxes on sales of their products over the internet  even though not physically present in the foreign country  could indirectly reduce demand for our products
