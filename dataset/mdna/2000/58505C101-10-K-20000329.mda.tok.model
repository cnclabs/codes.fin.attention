quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no financial instruments which are subject to market risk 
although the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the interest rates on its investments  a hypothetical adverse decrease in the interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations because the majority of the company s investments are short term treasury bills 
a reduction in interest rates would reduce interest income by approximately  annually 
due to the short period to maturity  the company believes that the impact of a reduction in interest rates would not have a material effect on the carrying value of its securities
