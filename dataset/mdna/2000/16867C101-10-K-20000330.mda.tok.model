item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements 
the information contains forward looking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with the oil and gas business 
we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable  but may be affected by a variety of factors including  but not limited to price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  drilling and production results  imprecision of reserve estimates  loss of market  industry competition  environmental risks and capital restrictions 
our financial statements and information are reported in us dollars and are prepared based upon canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our operating expenses are realized or incurred in us dollars 
for a discussion of the effect of differences in generally accepted accounting principles in canada and the us on our financial statements  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of calculating unit costs  oil and ngls are converted to mcf equivalents using a conversion rate of one bbl of oil equal to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
overview we have achieved a three year record of compounded annual production growth 
production in averaged mmcfe d mmcfe d after royalties compared to mmcfe d mmcfe d after royalties in and mmcfe d mmcfe d after royalties in this growth has been financed by cash flow  modest debt and equity 
primarily as a result of higher production volumes and recovering commodity prices  which resulted in increased net production revenues  cash flow from operations  after preferred share dividends  was million in compared to million in and million in our average natural gas price was per mcf in compared to in and in our combined average crude oil and ngls price per bbl was in compared to in and in net capital spending was million in compared to million in and million in proved reserve finding and development costs in were per mcfe per mcfe after royalties compared to per mcfe per mcfe after royalties in and per mcfe per mcfe after royalties in we increased our proved reserves for the sixth consecutive year  adding in excess of bcfe bcfe after royalties  corresponding to a reserve replacement rate of after royalties

comparing and  a significant factor affecting increased production volumes was the commencement of production at south marsh island during the first quarter of during  south marsh island contributed bcf bcf after royalties to our natural gas production and mbbls mbbls after royalties to oil production 
initial production at main pass d and main pass b contributed bcf bcf after royalties and bcf bcf after royalties  respectively  to natural gas production 
contributing to increased annual production in was a full year of production from both east cameron and high island b 
comparing and  the primary contributors to natural gas production growth were east cameron and main pass the aneth and ratherford units in the four corners area of utah were the primary contributors to increased oil production 
east cameron commenced production in the fourth quarter of in natural gas production from this field increased bcf bcf after royalties to bcf bcf after royalties and oil production  though constrained by repairs to a third party pipeline during the early part of the year  increased mbbls mbbls after royalties to mbbls mbbls after royalties 
development drilling in  combined with increased transportation capacity via the dauphin island gas gathering system  increased main pass natural gas production by bcf bcf after royalties to bcf bcf after royalties

natural gas prices in the us and in the us are largely determined by competitive market forces 
most of the natural gas produced by us has been marketed since by highland energy company  an aggregator for several us natural gas producers 
we have sold our oil production from the aneth and ratherford units in the four corners area of utah under successive term contracts to a regional refiner since due to the quantity and quality of this oil  we have obtained premiums over locally posted prices for this production 
most of our us gulf of mexico oil and natural gas liquids production is marketed by highland energy company 
market prices of oil and natural gas fluctuate and can adversely affect our operating results 
we sell most of our natural gas under short term contractual arrangements and do not engage in speculative forward selling of volumes that cannot be physically delivered 
to mitigate some of this risk  from time to time we may enter into forward contracts for a portion of our production so as to lock in a firm natural gas price for a specific volume and delivery period 
at december   we had entered into natural gas forward contracts through highland energy company and an oil forward contract with the regional refiner 
the forward contracts  all of which are for production  are for the physical delivery of natural gas volumes totaling bcf approximately to of our forecast volume  at an average price  net of transportation  of per mcf  and for the physical delivery of mbbls approximately of our forecast volume of oil  at an average price of per bbl 
forward contract volumes at both december  and were immaterial 
natural gas our composite average natural gas price was per mcf in compared to in and in the mild north american winter of had a significant downward effect on us natural gas prices  which were lower in the fourth quarter than in the corresponding period in natural gas prices in the us continued to be extremely weak during the first quarter of  when we received an average of per mcf 
thereafter  prices increased to an average of per mcf in the fourth quarter of for the full year  our average us natural gas price was per mcf  and our average uk natural gas price was per mcf  
oil and ngls our combined average oil and ngls price per bbl was in compared to in and in in  the combination of economic problems in asia  the mild north american winter and aggressive international competition for market share caused oil prices to fall sharply 
oil prices continued to be extremely weak during the first quarter of we received an average of per bbl during the first quarter of and the recovery in prices resulted in an average of per bbl during the fourth quarter of revenue the growth in our combined natural gas and oil production volumes was complemented by the recovery in commodity prices 
as a result  production revenue increased from to million million after royalties

the downward revision in our proved reserves at december  that resulted from low oil prices at that date contributed to the increase in our effective depletion rate 
comparing and  depletion and amortization expense increased  the result of an increase in units of production and a increase in the average depletion rate 
accounting rules require that we review regularly  on a country by country basis  the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for possible write down or impairment 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved reserves may not exceed the value of estimated future net revenues from those proved reserves 
full cost accounting rules allow  but do not require  companies to exclude costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties from their depletion cost centres  but if such costs are excluded  they must be separately assessed for impairment 
our policy on depletion does not exclude such costs from their respective depletion cost centres 
the scope of our libyan venture was such that we did not apply this policy 
libyan costs were excluded and separately assessed for impairment 
in libya  we and our partners concluded that the multi year exploration program  and the production test which commenced in december  were not commercial under the terms of the concession and therefore terminated the venture 
as a result  additional depletion of million was recorded in the second quarter of to eliminate the investment 
an impairment provision of million was recorded at december  in respect of one of the libyan concessions upon which no further exploration had been planned 
in the uk we recorded ceiling test impairments due to very low spot market prices for natural gas at december   and downward reserve revisions at december  taxes we have million in us tax pools and million in canadian tax pools to reduce future taxable income

in calculating finding costs  a number of anomalies between periods are created by the timing of expenditures and the phase of the exploration cycle 
this relates particularly to lease acquisitions and to major facility construction  as well as to recognition and revision of reserves 
multi year cumulative average calculations are a more meaningful reflection of a company s ability to find and produce reserves effectively

risk assessment there are a number of risks facing participants in the oil and gas industry 
some of the risks are common to all businesses while others are industry specific 
the following review includes our approach to managing various risks 
operational risks exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be hazardous  involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities  injure or kill people  and damage property and the environment 
because third party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells  we may not realize the full benefit of worker s compensation laws in dealing with their employees 
we seek to mitigate the foregoing risks by maintaining prudent levels of insurance against many potential losses and liabilities arising from our operations 
however  in accordance with customary industry practice  we may not be fully insured against these risks  nor may all such risks be insurable 
unless we successfully replace our reserves  our production will decline  resulting in lower revenues and cash flow 
replacing our reserves is particularly important because most of our reserves are in the us gulf of mexico where wells normally have steeper rates of decline than onshore wells 
exploring for oil and natural gas and developing oil and natural gas properties require significant capital expenditures and involve a high degree of financial risk 
the budgeted costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise and rig supply tightens 
drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons  including weather  cost overruns  equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties 
moreover  the successful drilling of an oil or gas well does not ensure a profit on investment 
exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells 
a variety of factors  both geological and market related  can cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic 
in addition to their costs  unsuccessful wells can harm our efforts to replace reserves 
we seek to limit our financial and operating risks in some projects by participating in drilling with industry partners and operators 
we believe this strategy limits our risk exposure in high potential prospects 
additionally  we have increasingly relied on advanced technologies  including d seismic analysis  to define geologic risks  thereby enhancing the results of our drilling efforts 
we also seek to operate our projects in order to better control drilling costs and timing of drilling 
environmental and safety risks us exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
these regulations affect costs  manner and feasibility of our operations 
changes in  or additions to  regulations regarding the protection of the environment could increase our compliance costs and may negatively impact our business 
us offshore oil and gas operations are subject to regulations of the us department of the interior which currently imposes absolute liability upon the lessee under a federal lease for the cost of pollution clean up resulting from the lessee s operations  and could subject the lessee to possible liability for pollution damage 
in the uk  deposits of substances or articles at sea from offshore oil and gas operations are subject to the licensing control of the ministry of agriculture  fisheries and food 
at present  we believe that our properties are being operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we do not anticipate that we will be required in the foreseeable future to expend amounts that are unusual  in relation to customary industry experience  by reason of environmental laws and regulations  but we are unable to quantify the ultimate cost of compliance 
marketing risks there is uncertainty as to the prices at which gas and oil we produce may be sold  and it is possible that under some market conditions the production of gas and oil from some of our properties may not be commercially feasible 
the availability of a ready market for gas and oil as produced and the price obtained for such gas and oil depend upon numerous factors beyond our control  including market considerations  the proximity and capacity of gas and oil pipelines and processing equipment and governmental regulation 
in recent years  markets for natural gas in the us have been characterized by periods of oversupply relative to demand 
there have been significant fluctuations in prices for both gas and oil in recent years and there can be no assurance that prices for gas or oil would not decrease in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are volatile and declined significantly during the second half of and early natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices as natural gas was after royalties of our equivalent production  after royalties of our production and before and after royalties of our production 
in  natural gas prices we received were lower than in and oil prices were lower 
primarily because of lower prices  we recorded ceiling test write downs of the uk assets in and most of the factors which affect natural gas and oil prices are beyond our control  such as demand  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  supply levels  import prices  political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  and actions taken by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
we could be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in the future if oil and natural gas prices are depressed for even a short period of time  are unusually volatile or if we have substantial downward revisions to our proved reserve quantities 
any such ceiling test write down would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction of shareholders equity  but would not impact our cash flow from operating activities 
once incurred  these write downs cannot be reversed at a later date 
year the year issue arose because many computerized systems used two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
in addition  similar problems may have arisen in some systems which used certain dates in to represent something other than the date 
although the change in date has occurred  it is not possible to conclude that all aspects of the year issue that may affect us  including those related to customers  suppliers  or other third parties  have been fully resolved 
we have interests in a substantial number of offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that are operated by others 
production volumes are transported through pipelines and processed through facilities that are also operated by others 
computers are used extensively to control and operate such pipelines and facilities in the oil and natural gas industry 
as of the date of this form k report  no year issue related event has occurred that materially affects us  including shutdown of production  transportation or processing facilities 
costs that we incurred in preparation for the year issue were not material

outlook and prospects for future growth our strategy our strategy is to increase our reserves  production  revenue and cash flow through exploration and development drilling and through the acquisition of leasehold acreage and producing properties 
the elements of our strategy include the following o focus on the us gulf of mexico region 
we focus our operations on the us gulf of mexico region where we have acquired a significant exploration acreage position and assembled a substantial d seismic database 
we believe this region combines significant geological potential  reservoir size  quality and deliverability with favorable commodity pricing and attractive finding  development and operating costs 
o grow through exploration 
we are pursuing an active technology driven exploration program that is designed to balance projects with lower risk and moderate potential with drilling prospects which have higher risk and substantial potential 
we generate exploration prospects through geological and geophysical analysis of d seismic and other data and also review prospects generated by others 
our board of directors has approved a budget of million for exploration and development capital expenditures and we expect to use approximately million of this amount for exploration activities 
we are currently drilling or plan to drill approximately exploratory and development wells in the us gulf of mexico region in approximately two thirds of these will be exploration wells and the remainder are development wells to follow up the discoveries 
o manage drilling risks through joint ventures and the use of advanced technologies 
as described under operational risks on page o evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions 
we continually review opportunities to acquire leasehold acreage and producing properties 
we seek to acquire properties that we believe have significant exploration potential and to increase our working interest in producing lease blocks when available to us on economically favorable terms 
our strengths we believe that our future performance and historical success are directly related to the following combination of strengths o substantial inventory of drilling projects in the us gulf of mexico region 
in the us gulf of mexico region  we have generated an inventory of over drilling prospects 
all of these locations have been evaluated and defined using d seismic data 
our large inventory permits us to be flexible in project selection and in the timing of drilling 
by identifying new exploration targets and acquiring additional acreage  we continually add to our drilling inventory 
o proven exploratory expertise 
our ability to define and participate in successful prospects in the us gulf of mexico is demonstrated by our exploratory drilling success rate in the us gulf of mexico region of for o experienced technical team 
our technical team is comprised of highly respected industry professionals with an average of more than twenty years of industry experience 
we believe our exploration success is a direct result of this team s geologic  geophysical  engineering and technical analysis 
o financial flexibility 
at december   million was available under our revolving credit facility 
we seek to maintain low levels of debt in order to be able to respond quickly to drilling or acquisition opportunities 
our look forward the fundamentals for us natural gas production remain very positive with the us energy information administration reporting natural gas demand growing at an average rate of two per cent annually while domestic natural gas deliverability is showing a modest decline 
extremely mild weather  which had a significant impact on natural gas demand in  continues to be a factor 
temperatures through much of the us were considerably warmer than normal in the fall and early winter of natural gas in storage remains at relatively high levels and has brought natural gas prices down somewhat  but increasing demand and declining deliverability have prevented natural gas prices from falling to the extremely low levels experienced in the first quarter of at year end  the american gas association reported that storage volumes were higher than comparative averages for  but lower than at year end on the natural gas supply side  low commodity prices dramatically reduced drilling for new supplies which contributed to an estimated decline in domestic production during the active rig count in the us declined by in to average rigs from in  according to baker hughes 
the rig count was in and  in reduced demand for drilling rigs was particularly acute in the us gulf of mexico where the average number of active rigs declined to rigs in from in and in the gulf of mexico newsletter reported that only wells were drilled in the us gulf of mexico in compared with in and  in moreover  the number of reported discoveries fell to in from in and in as began  rigs were under contract for a utilization rate of compared with active rigs for a utilization rate of at the end of the foregoing supports the conclusion of many industry observers that the natural gas supply and demand equation is tightening up in the us this balancing of natural gas supply and demand will confer benefits on properly poised companies in our industry 
we believe that adherence to our strategy will bring continued growth  and maintain a strong balance sheet which will  in turn  allow us to be opportunistic and to grow even during periods of low natural gas and oil prices 
we have achieved strong production growth of  and in  and respectively 
our planned exploration and development program  which we expect to fund from operating cash flow and our unsecured revolving credit facility  is expected to increase production volumes by to over levels 
early in  we will benefit from new production at the northeast wright field in louisiana and new offshore facilities will commence production as the year unfolds at high island a a  high island a  south timbalier  vermilion and west cameron any delays in initial production from these properties would have an effect on our production volumes 
our capital expenditures can vary significantly as a result of exploration success  availability of equipment and services and opportunities 
we will continue to monitor capital spending and adjust investment levels in relation to cash flow projections 
if reductions were required to be made to our budgeted capital expenditures  economic merit and a longer term view would be used to make such decisions 
specifically  fewer wildcat wells could be drilled either delayed or deleted  bidding at lease sales could be curtailed and seismic data acquisition could be reduced 
if our budgeted capital expenditures were to be increased  for reasons other than cost overruns or expenditures contingent on successful drilling  great care would be taken to ensure that our associated human resources would be adequate
