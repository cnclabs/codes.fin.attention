item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed at item description of business factors that may influence future results 
during  we operated in three reportable segments computer consulting and development services  computer hardware and utility solutions 
computer consulting and development services gross profit margins in this segment continued to experience downward pressure due to increased labor costs in the israeli operations resulting from the relative shortage of qualified programmers and engineers 
we expect that the competitive marketplace for qualified engineers will continue to affect margins in and future periods 
computer hardware in this segment suffered a decrease in sales and profitability due to its highly concentrated customer base  dependence on a small number of customers  increasing pressure on prices within the industry and increased competition from the direct sales efforts of the major equipment vendors 
although in the last quarter of we diversified our customer base and achieved record sales  we may be harmed in the future by these developments 
utility solutions since we have been designing  developing and marketing two way interactive communications solutions which provide real time remote automated meter reading and data management capabilities to utilities  energy service companies and industrial and commercial customers 
in january  we acquired certain assets and licensed intellectual property from lucent technologies  inc this technology is being used by our comverge technologies subsidiary  which is marketing the comverge distributed connection to commercial and industrial customers in the us in august we acquired the scientific atlanta control systems business division  including its line of load control products and maingate gateway system 
with the sale of our interest in tower in january  our results in future periods will no longer be affected by our pro rata inclusion of tower s net income as equity loss in affiliates

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for reconciliation to our consolidated financial information 
years ended december   and sales 
the increase in sales in as compared to was primarily due to the sales of the utility solutions segment  which first began to have substantial sales in the second quarter of these sales included load control products as well as gateway products 
as reflected in the table above  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in computer hardware sales  primarily during the first half of  as well as the sale of our phd help desk division in april the decrease in sales in as compared to was primarily due to the sale of the help desk division 
gross profit 
gross profit remained stable in as compared to because the increased gross profit in the utility solutions segment was offset by decreased gross profit and gross profit margin in the computer hardware segment and by the sale of the help desk division 
the decrease in gross profit margin in the computer hardware segment resulted from a shift in sales to lower margin customers and products which caused gross profit margin in this segment to decrease from in to in the increase in gross profit and gross profit margin in as compared to was primarily due to the writedown in of previously deferred production expenses related to the discontinuation of our cybrcard product 
gross profit and gross profit margin in the computer hardware segment increased as well 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of the help desk division 
gross profit margin in the computer consulting and development services segment experienced continued downward pressure during the three year period due to increased labor costs resulting from the relative shortage of qualified programmers and engineers 
research and development expenses r d 
the decrease in r d in as compared to was due to lower r d in the utility solutions segment  as the development of the epsm product approached completion 
the increase in r d in as compared to was due to increased epsm product development expenses incurred to prepare the product for commercial release 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
the decrease in sg a  both nominally and as a percentage of sales  in as compared to was primarily due to the sale of the help desk division  partially offset by increased marketing activity and administrative costs related to the utility solutions segment  which increased its level of activity significantly in the decrease in sg a in as compared to  was primarily due to the sale of the help desk division and the reduced level of activity in the multimedia entertainment segment  partially offset by increased marketing activity related to our utility solutions segment 
gain on sale of division 
we recognized a gain from the sale of our help desk division in april finance expense  net 
the increase in finance expenses in as compared to was due to the term loan taken in august to finance the acquisition of the scientific atlanta control systems business division  increased utilization of our lines of credit and the finance expenses related to the convertible debentures we issued in the last quarter of unrealized loss from writedown of investment 
due to the continued decrease in tower s share price in the last quarter of  we wrote down our investment by million to reflect tower s public share price as of december income taxes 
the income tax provisions for  and were based on actual tax computations 
the tax expense in is entirely due to foreign taxes related to the sale of our interest in tower 
we established a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets due to our history of losses and the uncertainty of utilization of these tax benefits 
for a detailed analysis of the income tax provision  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
equity loss in affiliates 
the continued increase in equity losses in over the three year period resulted from losses in tower  primarily attributable to a continued decrease in tower sales and capacity utilization 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had working capital of approximately million 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to the reclassification of our investment in tower as a current investment following our agreement to sell our tower investment in december we financed our corporate activities  the operations of our us subsidiaries and our acquisition activity  including our purchase of the minority interest in our dsi israel subsidiary and of the scientific atlanta control systems business division  from the net proceeds of short term bank debt of million  bearing interest at prime plus  and the issuance of our million of subordinated convertible debentures 
in january we received approximately million net of applicable withholding taxes from the sale of our tower investment 
in february we redeemed million of the debentures for a redemption price of million 
the  balance of the debentures was converted into  shares of our common stock 
we believe we now have adequate liquidity to finance our operating activities and corporate expenses for this year and the forseeable future 
dsi israel satisfied its financial and operating requirements in through increased usage of bank credit lines made available  sale of marketable securities and cash from operations 
bank credit lines currently available to dsi israel total approximately million  denominated in nis and bearing interest at an average interest rate of the israeli prime rate plus per annum 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
as of december  dsi israel was utilizing million of these lines 
in april we purchased the minority interest in dsi israel at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the increase in accounts receivable  inventory and goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as short term debt  accounts payable and other current liabilities at the end of as compared to the end of  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the assets and the increased level in the utility solution segment 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations during a majority of our sales were denominated in dollars 
the remaining portion is primarily denominated in nis  linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed for 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed for  through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of our expenses in were in dollars or dollar linked nis and virtually all the remaining expenses were in nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel is affected adversely by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar since most of its transactions are linked to or are denominated in us dollars 
this adverse effect principally arises with respect to its severance pay obligations and also with respect to the unbilled portion of long term projects 
as of december   virtually all of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis  and the net amount of such monetary assets and liabilities was not material 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations
