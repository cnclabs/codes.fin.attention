this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and in management s opinion reflects all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
based on the company s operating history and factors that may cause fluctuations in the quarterly results  quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
although the company s revenues are not generally seasonal in nature  the company has experienced decreases in first quarter revenues compared to the preceding fourth quarter which are believed to result primarily from the capital asset purchase cycle of the company s customers 
the level of the company s operating expenses is partially based on its expectations of future revenues 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if revenues do not materialize in a period as expected 
since expense levels are usually committed in advance of revenues and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenues  the company s results of operations may be impacted significantly by lower revenues 
the company s revenues were lower each quarter in fiscal compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year 
this decrease in revenues was attributable to a slow down in customer upgrading of legacy product  that has not been offset by customer purchasing of the ns product  and lower than expected acceptance by the market of our ns product 
in addition  the company reduced the average selling price of a system as a result of competitive pressures

additionally  included in the fiscal purchases are disbursements of million in connection with capital expenditures and leasehold improvements for a new facility  which the company occupied in february purchases of short term investments represent reinvestment of the proceeds from sale and maturities of short term investments and investment of cash and cash equivalents into short term investments

factors that may affect future results risks of the restructuring plan the company has implemented a restructuring plan that includes a significant reduction in force and a consolidation of its santa clara based operations into one building 
while management believes these measures are necessary and that the reduction in force will not impair any of the critical functions of the company  if the company is unable to retain and recruit employees with critical skills in the future  that could have a negative impact on future results 
see forward looking statement on page potential significant fluctuations in quarterly results the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a combination of factors 
these factors include the timing of orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  and the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold 
the company generally realizes higher gross margins on sales of systems to end users and on single system sales than on systems sold through distributors and oems and on multiple system sales 
in addition  given the company s focus on highly configured enterprise class systems  the loss or delay in a given quarter of a relatively limited number of system sales could adversely affect the company s revenues 
historically  the company often has recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of any given quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
competitive market the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company experiences substantial competition  principally from sun microsystems  network appliance  emc corporation  hewlett packard company and sgi  among others 
some companies have introduced proprietary products to provide network attached storage 
most of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of product upgrades to its installed base of customers  including additional processors  memory and disk 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrades sales 
in addition  decisions by customers not to increase capacity to their current systems could adversely impact the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product engineering and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
management in transition  employee turnover competition for employees with technical  management and other skills is intense in the computer industry and is particularly intense in the san francisco bay area 
the company has recently encountered some difficulties in fulfilling its hiring needs and retaining key employees in this employment market  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring and retaining qualified employees in the future 
the company s failure to retain the services of key personnel or to attract additional qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has experienced turnover of several senior members of management 
in particular  on february   mr 
gary j 
sbona replaced mr 
bruce n 
moore as the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  and the company entered into an agreement with regent pacific management corporation  regent pacific a management firm of which mr 
sbona is the chief executive officer 
pursuant to the agreement  regent pacific will provide management services to the company  including the services of mr 
sbona as chief executive officer  one of a five person regent pacific management team 
the agreement has a one year term and may be cancelled by the company after expiration of the initial week period  with a minimum compensation to regent pacific of  for that initial period 
we rely on regent pacific management corporation for the management of auspex and the loss of these services could adversely affect our business 
software product risks the company markets optional software products in addition to its line of network file servers 
these software products include netservices tm  driveguard tm  fastbackup tm  serverguard tm  serverguard global tm  dataguard tm  turbocopy  and turbocopyreplicator 
the company also expects to release enhancements and new features for these products from time to time 
although the company performs extensive testing prior to releasing software products  such products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released 
these may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments 
failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could delay product introductions  require design modifications to previously shipped products  cause unfavorable publicity or negatively impact system shipments  any of which could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products new product introductions by the company or its competitors carry the risk that customers could delay or cancel orders for existing products pending shipment of the new products 
for instance  product transition issues had an adverse impact on north america  europe and pacific rim revenues in fiscal the company s strategy is to continue to introduce new products and upgrades to existing products on an ongoing basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products and enhancements or that these new products and enhancements will adequately address market requirements  achieve market acceptance or generate substantial sales 
additionally  delays in the launch or lack of availability of new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on established standards the rapid emergence of new or alternate standards  such as linux  which replace or diminish the market acceptance of unix operating systems  network file system nfs or windows nt  on which the company s products are currently based  could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations unless the company is able to incorporate any such standards in the company s products in a timely manner 
dependence on certain customers distributors for each of fiscal  and  direct sales of products and services to intel represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
intel is not obligated to purchase any minimum level of products from the company 
additional significant reductions in product sales to intel would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on certain suppliers certain of the company s products contain critical components supplied by a single or limited number of third parties 
while the company has an inventory of these critical components  any significant or prolonged shortage of these components or the failure of the third party suppliers to maintain or enhance these components could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
excess or obsolete inventory managing the company s inventory of components and finished products is a complex task 
a number of factors  including but not limited to  the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components which are in short supply or which must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing  the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules  may result in the see forward looking statement on page company maintaining large amounts of inventory 
other factors  including changes in market demand and technology  may cause inventory to become obsolete 
any excess or obsolete inventory could result in price reductions and or inventory write downs  which in turn could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
risks of international sales  european and japanese market risks during fiscal  and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were derived from markets outside of north america 
the company expects that sales to the pacific rim and europe will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s pacific rim or european operations will continue to be successful 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from localized economic and market conditions 
for example  the company experienced a decrease in revenues from the pacific rim during fiscal and due to further weakness in the japanese economy 
in addition  the company s international business may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency restrictions 
the company purchases the majority of its materials and services in us dollars  and most of its foreign sales are transacted in us dollars 
continued increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will make the company s products sold internationally less price competitive 
the company has offices in a number of foreign countries  the operating expenses of which are also subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
financial exposure may result due to the timing of transactions and movement of exchange rates 
the company s international business may further be affected by risks such as trade restrictions  increases in tariff and freight rates and difficulties in obtaining necessary export licenses and meeting appropriate local regulatory standards 
for example  the company has had to modify its products in minor respects in japan to comply with local electromagnetic emissions standards  and must also comply with corresponding european economic community standards 
in marketing its products to the european economic community  the company also must face the challenges posed by a fragmented market complicated by local distribution channels and local cultural considerations 
for international sales  the company has largely relied on distributors or oems  most of who are entitled to carry products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing risks or issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock market fluctuations in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the company currently relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its hardware and software products 
the company currently holds fourteen united states patents and has filed applications for additional patents 
the company also has filed applications for counterpart patents in foreign countries  including japan 
there can be no assurance that the company s present or future competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
further  there can be no assurance that see forward looking statement on page the company s patent applications will result in issued patents  or that the company s issued patents will be upheld if challenged 
additionally  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future projects or that any such assertions may not require the company to refrain from the sale of its products  enter into royalty arrangements or undertake costly litigation 
the company s adherence to industry standards with respect to its products limits the company s opportunities to provide proprietary features  which may be protected 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
year compliance to date  the company has not incurred material costs associated with year compliance nor any disruption with vendors or operations 
furthermore  the company believes that any future costs associated with year compliance efforts will not be material

as of june   the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts were comprised of million in british pounds  million in german marks  and million french francs
