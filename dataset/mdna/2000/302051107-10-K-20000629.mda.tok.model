item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors which affect our financial performance in the last three fiscal years  our financial performance has been affected by several major factors including lead 
lead is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of batteries  representing approximately one third of our cost of goods sold 
the market price of lead fluctuates significantly 
generally  when lead prices decrease  many of our customers seek disproportionate price reductions from us  and when lead prices increase  customers tend to be more accepting of price increases 
lead market prices declined substantially over the last three fiscal years 
competition 
the automotive battery market in north america and the automotive and industrial battery markets in europe are highly competitive 
in recent years  competition has increased and we have come under increasing pressure for price reductions 
price competition in europe has been particularly intense 
this price competition has been exacerbated by an environment of low priced asian imports  excess capacity and declining lead prices 
exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk in most european countries  principally germany  france  united kingdom  spain  and italy 
movements of exchange rates against the us dollar can result in variations in the us dollar value of our non us sales 
in some instances gains in one currency may be offset by losses in another 
our results for the periods presented were adversely impacted by the overall weakness in european currencies 
weather 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
during the periods discussed below  unusually warm winters resulted in fewer automotive battery failures in north america and europe and this adversely affected our aftermarket sales 
results of operations year ended march  compared with year ended march  excluding non recurring or unusual charges  the company reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to a restated net loss  excluding non recurring or unusual charges  of million  or 
per diluted share  for the previous fiscal year 
earnings in fiscal were favorably impacted by 
strong industrial battery market demand in europe  particularly in the telecommunications sector in the latter part of the year 

increases in average selling prices in the us due to our continued focus on a better mix of customers 

reduced costs in europe due to general efficiency improvements 
these operating improvements were offset in part by 
the negative impact of the weak euro  which affected pre tax earnings by approximately million 

automotive aftermarket sales volume reductions in north america and europe due to unusually warm winter weather 

continued pricing pressure in the european automotive aftermarket and oem businesses 

increased selling  general and administrative costs in north america 
including non recurring or unusual items  the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the company recorded certain unusual or non recurring charges aggregating million in fiscal  including million in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  the company recorded million of non recurring or unusual charges described in the fiscal and fiscal comparison below 
no tax benefits were recorded on the non recurring or unusual charges in fiscal or fiscal the charges in fiscal consisted of 
million provision to cover resolution of used as new claims litigation 
the company reached a tentative settlement covering the most significant of our cases and we now believe the remaining claims can be settled 
the cash portion including legal fees  is less than million 
the balance of the provision is in coupons that can be redeemed  for the purchase of a new battery 
the tentative agreement remains subject to court approval and final negotiation 

million of restructuring charges  related primarily to the company s realignment to a customer focused global business unit strategy  including severance charges of million and million in asset write downs and closure costs related to planned closures of manufacturing operations and other facilities including the reading  pennsylvania battery plant  certain us branch locations and the company s ongoing consolidation of european operations 
additional restructuring charges may be recorded over the next several years as additional plant closures and consolidation of administrative functions are identified as part of the company s program to improve our cost structure 

million of write downs to net realizable value related to the ongoing divestiture of non core businesses 

an increase to the company s environmental reserves of million 

non cash charges of million related to asset write downs and adjustments of balance sheet reserves  including million in warranty reserves 

the company also recorded million of unusual items in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal  including a charge for in process research and development of million for the acquisition of lion compact energy and additional divestiture related charges of million 
the company restated results for fiscal and fiscal as a result of the company s former management team s improper authorization of the deferral of a pre fiscal charge until fiscal and this resulted in an increase in earnings of 
per diluted share and 
per diluted share in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this impact is reflected in the discussion and reported results herein 
there is no impact in fiscal the company changed its method of valuing inventory for us battery inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
this change did not impact the company s earnings for any of the periods presented 
generally accepted accounting principles require the company to restate for this particular accounting change 
as such  retained earnings for the earliest period presented have been restated herein 
the fiscal non recurring or unusual charges discussed above  and the fiscal charges specified in the fiscal and fiscal comparison below  were the main factors impacting fiscal and fiscal as reported operating results 
comparative results were as follows net sales 
net sales decreased million or to  million as compared to  million in fiscal included in this reduction is the million of warranty non cash charge previously discussed 
unusual charges of million were recorded in fiscal approximately million or of the fiscal decrease related to weakened currency rates in europe 
the remaining decrease relates to the global automotive aftermarket sales volume reduction along with continued automotive pricing pressure in europe  partially offset by average selling price increases in the us and the strong european industrial market 
industrial battery sales included above were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million or to million 
besides non recurring or unusual charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  gross profit was favorably impacted by the strong european industrial market  average selling price increases in the us and reduced european manufacturing costs 
these improvements were mitigated by the weak euro  the overall volume reductions in the automotive aftermarket business and the european automotive pricing pressures 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million 
besides non recurring or unusual charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  operating expenses were favorably impacted by european general and administrative cost reductions and the weak euro  offset by increased expenses in north america 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million or to million versus million in as a result of lower borrowing levels and the impact of weaker european currencies 
also included in interest expense in fiscal was a non recurring charge of million 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal was million versus million in besides non recurring or unusual charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  other income was favorably impacted in fiscal by gains on certain sales of land of approximately million 
income tax provision 
income tax expense decreased million to million 
the us and european non recurring or unusual charges in both fiscal years were not tax benefited 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased million or to  million as compared to  million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the following factors 
the inclusion of deta a german industrial and automotive battery manufacturer acquired on september  for months of fiscal versus months of fiscal million 

higher automotive battery volumes in north america of million offset by higher sales deductions of million 
along with a full year of deta sales  european sales were also favorably impacted by exchange rates million and slightly higher automotive unit volume 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable automotive battery pricing mix in europe  lower industrial sales excluding the full year effect of deta and a reduction in other european sales 
industrial battery sales included above for fiscal were million for fiscal versus million in gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million or to million 
the decrease in gross profit is largely a result of the items discussed above and the following 
a million charge related to write downs associated with exiting non core business activities and the closure of certain facilities  
a million loss on lead hedging contracts in north america  
a million charge for an adverse appellate court ruling in a patent infringement lawsuit  
a million charge for the write off of inventory and equipment related to an abandoned project  and 
a million charge for the write off of unsaleable inventory specified for the russian market 
these decreases were partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs  particularly in europe  along with the impact of sales volume increases mentioned above and a greater emphasis on sales of higher profit margin batteries 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million 
the impact of including deta for months in fiscal versus only months in fiscal resulted in approximately million of the increase 
also contributing to this increase was 
charges of million related to specific legal expenses  including settlement of the florida attorney general investigation  
a million charge for increased bad debt reserves primarily related to north american customers who have filed for bankruptcy  
a million charge related to separation packages of executives and additional retirement charges  
a million charge for uncollectable receivables from sales in russia  
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates million and 
a million charge relating to write downs associated with existing non core business activities 
goodwill amortization increased million or to million from million in  resulting primarily from the write off of goodwill associated with the closure of a smelter operation and the write off of impaired goodwill from certain branch acquisitions of million 
operating income 
operating income decreased million as a result of the matters discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million or to million versus million in as a result of lower rates achieved through debt restructuring completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in was million versus million in for a change of million 
contributing to this change was 
currency transaction losses in of million versus currency transaction gains of million in  
a million charge in recorded for an amendment fee related to interest rate swap agreements and 
fiscal included a million gain from an involuntary conversion due to a fire 
income tax provision 
income tax expense increased million to million despite the million reduction in pre tax earnings 
us tax losses and certain european tax losses were not tax benefited in fiscal net income loss 
the net loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the matters discussed above offset by a million reduction in extraordinary loss relating to the early retirement of debt 
seasonality and weather we sell most of our automotive aftermarket batteries during the fall and early winter our second and third fiscal quarters 
retailers buy automotive batteries during these periods so they will have enough inventory when cold weather strikes 
in addition  many of our industrial battery customers in europe do not place their battery orders until the end of the calendar year 
the seasonality of our business increases our working capital requirements 
demand for automotive aftermarket batteries is significantly affected by the weather 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
mild winters and cool summers have the opposite effect 
as a result  if our sales are reduced by an unusually warm winter or cool summer  it is not possible for us to recover these sales in later periods 
further  if our sales are adversely affected by the weather  we cannot make offsetting cost reductions to protect our gross margins in the short term because a large portion of our manufacturing and distribution costs are fixed 
pending acquisition of gnb as discussed in item  on may   the company entered into an agreement to acquire the global battery business of gnb for consideration of approximately million including million in cash and four million exide common shares plus assumed liabilities 
gnb is a leading us and pacific rim manufacturer of both automotive and industrial batteries with annual sales of approximately billion 
the acquisition  which is expected to close in fiscal  is subject to foreign regulatory review  financing and settlement of certain non compete agreements 
financing is currently being arranged and is expected to be sourced through a combination of debt and certain asset securitizations 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of seasonal working capital needs  obligations on our indebtedness and capital expenditures 
historically  we have met these liquidity requirements through operating cash flows  borrowed funds and the proceeds of sales of accounts receivable and sale leaseback transactions 
additional cash has been generated in the current year  and will be generated in fiscal from the sale of non core businesses 
we have a us receivables purchase agreement and a european receivables purchase agreement under which the other parties have committed subject to certain exceptions to purchase selected accounts receivable from us  up to a maximum commitment of million and million  respectively 
because of the seasonality of our business  more cash is typically generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters than the first and second quarters 
our greatest cash demands from operations occur during the months of june through october 
we believe we will be able to meet our requirements for liquidity with cash generated from operations  reduced working capital requirements  borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our credit agreement  the proceeds from sales of accounts receivable under our securitization facilities and or sales of non core businesses and assets 
ebitda  excluding non recurring or unusual items and discounts on receivables sold  was million for the current fiscal year versus million in the prior year 
our cash flow from operating activities was million including million related to sales of receivables  million including million related to sales of receivables and million net of a million decrease related to sales of receivables in fiscal  and  respectively 
primary working capital year on year is down approximately million  due primarily to inventory reductions of approximately million and approximately million from currency effects 
our capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our credit agreement restricts the amount of capital expenditures which we can make  but we believe that such restrictions will not adversely effect our capital expenditure programs 
capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately million in fiscal the company generated more than million in cash and assumed liabilities from the sale of non core businesses and other assets in fiscal proceeds were used primarily to reduce debt 
businesses now planned to be sold in fiscal are expected to generate cash in excess of million 
in fiscal we recorded million of restructuring charges  related primarily to the company s realignment to a customer focused global business unit strategy  including severance charges of million and million in asset write downs and closure costs related to planned closures of manufacturing operations and other facilities including the reading  pennsylvania battery plant  certain us branch locations and the company s ongoing consolidation of european operations 
additional restructuring charges may be recorded over the next several years as additional plant closures and consolidation of administrative functions are identified as part of the company s program to improve our cost structure 
the expected cash portion of the charge  largely related to severance  will be paid out primarily in fiscal these cash outlays will be offset by prospective operating cost savings 
debt levels decreased year on year by million from billion to billion principally due to reductions in inventory levels and cash proceeds from the sale of non core businesses in fiscal as of march   we had million outstanding and million available under our credit agreement after consideration of million of outstanding letters of credit 
the use of such availability may be limited by certain covenants in the credit agreement 
increases in interest rates on such obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have an interest rate collar agreement which reduces the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate debt 
the collar agreement effectively limits the pibor paris interbank offered rate base interest rate on million french francs us million of borrowings to no more than and no less than through december  we have three currency and interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert million of borrowings under the credit agreement and certain inter company loans into million french francs us million  million euros us million and million british pounds sterling us million 
we receive libor and pay pibor and pounds sterling libor 
effective march  the company assigned million french francs us million of its existing currency and interest rate swap agreement to a new counterparty and received a cash payment of euro million 
simultaneously  the company entered into a new million euro us million one year currency and interest rate hedge agreement 
the company receives libor plus and pays euro libor plus 
as of march   we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in europe and in the united states which are available  subject to certain restrictions  to offset future us and certain european countries taxable income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets include certain amounts of net operating loss carryforwards  principally in the us  which management believes are realizable through a combination of anticipated tax planning strategies and forecasted future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted future taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of any remaining recorded net deferred tax assets 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operations during the past three years 
we generally have been able to offset the effects of inflation with price increases  cost reduction programs and operating efficiencies 
future environmental developments we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
future environmental  health and safety standards may be more stringent 
we anticipate that such potential standards could cause an increase in our capital expenditures and operating costs 
unless and until the standards are adopted it is not possible to estimate these costs with any certainty or to predict whether they will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see business environmental  health and safety matters 
year issue we successfully achieved year compliance during the third quarter of fiscal we are not aware of any open matters  however  we continue to monitor year compliance internally and with our vendors 
costs for year remediations were approximately million  which was consistent with prior estimates 
these costs were expensed as incurred with the exception of capitalizable replacement hardware 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and a common currency  the euro 
we conduct significant business in these member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january  and june  we have addressed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro and continue to address related issues with its ongoing implementation 
the more important issues facing us include 
converting information technology systems  
reassessing currency risk  
negotiating and amending contracts  and 
processing tax and accounting records 
based upon progress to date  we believe that use of the euro has not and will not have a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our business affairs and process our business and accounting records 
accordingly  conversion to the euro has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and interest rates 
in order to manage these risks  we participate in a risk management program  which includes entering into certain foreign exchange and commodity forward contracts and options 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is provided in notes and to the financial statements 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor foreign exchange  commodity and interest rate risks  and related hedge positions 
positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk models 
the following analyses are based on sensitivity analysis tests which assume instantaneous  parallel shift in exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of sensitivity shifts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
more specifically  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to uncertainty to which future earnings or assets and liability values are exposed due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to france  italy  united kingdom  spain and germany 
as of march   the net gain based on fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was about million 
the potential loss in fair value liability for such financial instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be about million 
the model assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates  however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates 
commodity price risk we enter into commodity forward and option contracts 
these contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various metals used in the manufacturing of our lead acid batteries 
no such contracts were outstanding at march  interest rate risk we have historically entered into interest rate swaps and other interest sensitive forward and option contracts 
such contracts are executed to offset our exposure to interest rate risk on our debt 
certain hedging activities on may   we entered into an interest rate bond swap agreement for million principal amount of our senior notes 
under the agreement  we paid libor plus to a counterparty and received from the counterparty the fixed coupon rate payments we made 
at the end of the agreement  the counterparty was guaranteed repayment of its open market purchase price of the notes  which exceeded face value by  this debt modification was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt  and the related write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  along with the premium paid by the counterparty  resulted in an extraordinary loss of  in october  we paid an amendment fee of million to the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements related to million of our senior notes due this fee was recorded as other expense in the third fiscal quarter of in november  we terminated the million interest rate swap agreements 
in connection with such termination  we made a cash payment of million  of which million was recorded as a bond discount 
in january  we amended certain provisions effective december  of our existing credit agreement 
recently issued accounting pronouncements sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that entities recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the statement and will be required to adopt it in the first quarter of fiscal
