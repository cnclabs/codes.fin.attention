item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the company and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
see also forward looking statements on page of this annual report on form k 
overview the company continued strong growth in assets and deposits  with growth in existing markets aided by favorable economic and market conditions 
the company also acquired black diamond savings bank  headquartered in norton  virginia  a transaction that added approximately million in assets at the closing date of august  the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and all financial statements and other data have been restated to reflect this business combination 
as a result of the black diamond merger  fnb financial services corporation is now a north carolina bank holding company with consolidated assets of million at december  the company  through its two subsidiaries  fnb southeast  a north carolina chartered commercial bank  and black diamond savings bank  a federally chartered savings bank  currently operates fifteen banking offices in north carolina and virginia 
on march  the company filed an application with the office of the commission of banks for the state of north carolina to merge black diamond into fnb southeast 
the effect of the merger  if approved  would be to operate black diamond locations as branches of fnb southeast 
during the year  both fnb southeast and black diamond the subsidiary banks expanded their banking networks 
fnb southeast opened an office in burgaw  north carolina  and has two offices in greensboro  north carolina under construction 
these two offices are expected to open early in the second quarter of and complement our existing branch in that market 
black diamond opened a second harrisonburg  virginia office in the third quarter of to capitalize on its existing presence in this growing market 
both banks continue to look at additional markets and sites for future expansion of their franchises 
results of operations net income for the full year totaled million  or in diluted earnings per share  and is inclusive of approximately  in after tax merger related expenses and other charges in connection with the acquisition of black diamond 
pro forma annual net income excluding these one time charges totaled million  or in diluted earnings per share  and represents a increase over restated net income of million in non interest expenses of million was higher than the prior year and included  in merger related cost such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  printers and other charges 
recurring expenses excluding these one time expense items was million  a increase from levels 
the company s primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between i interest income and fees derived from earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and ii the cost of funds primarily deposits and other borrowings supporting them 
net interest income represents the gross profit from the lending and investment activities of a banking organization and is the most significant factor affecting the earnings of the company 
net interest income is influenced by changes in interest rates  volume and the mix of these various components 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  which represented a increase over the previous year 
in  taxable equivalent net interest income increased to approximately million from approximately million in  which was an increase of 
actual net interest income was higher in  following an improvement of in growth in net interest income for was occasioned by higher loan balances and improved net interest margins  supported by deposit growth and increased borrowing from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
average loans outstanding during the year equaled million compared to million in  an increase of 
in the previous year  average loans outstanding were higher than this loan growth is attributed to generally favorable economic conditions in the company s lending markets and the addition of commercial loan officers in selected markets 
average investment securities during were million  down over  following a substantial increase of the previous year 
average total deposits of million were up in  which followed a gain of the previous year 
average shareholders equity balances of million represented a increase over overall trends in interest rates continued lower for the full year 
although the earning asset yield declined  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities experienced a steeper decline  allowing for improved net interest margins for the weighted average yield on earning assets fell to  from in  a decrease of basis points 
this is primarily due to the current yield on loans dropping basis points to in  compared to a yield of in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  from last year 
consequently  the interest rate spread rose to in  from the previous year 
the prime rate on loans was increased from to during the second half of the rate increase came too late in the year to prevent the weighted rate on loans from falling to in compared to in investment securities yields were on a taxable equivalent basis in  down from last year 
the weighted average rate paid on savings and time deposits decreased from in to this year  as depositors renewed maturing certificates at lower rates and increased balances in relatively lower cost money market instruments 
table on page summarizes net interest income and average yields earned and rates paid for the years indicated  on a tax equivalent basis 
table on page presents the changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to volume and rate changes between and  and between and non interest income and expense non interest income of million in was  or less than the previous year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to million  up from million in the company was able to capitalize on increased fees and increased volume of demand deposits and other accounts with service charges 
two categories of non interest income  gain on sale of securities and gain on sale of loans  experienced significant declines in compared to due to changes in the interest rate environment during the year 
gains on sale of securities for totaled  down  from the prior year 
gain on sale of loans for totaled  down  from one year earlier 
both of these categories were negatively impacted by the trend of rising interest rates over the second half of in  the company recorded  in bankcard fee revenue 
due to the sale of the credit card portfolio and the merchant account program  these revenues will decline significantly in recurring non interest expense  excluding the  in merger related costs  increased million  or  in to million  compared to million in last year  non interest expense of million exceeded the previous year by million  or 
the primary reasons for the increase in expense in have been the full year effect of depreciation on the personal computer network installed in  and fees for internal audit services that were outsourced during personnel expense of million in exceeded the previous year by  or 
total salaries of officers and staff of million were  or more than at december   the company had approximately full time and part time employees  compared with approximately full time and part time employees at december  occupancy expense followed a increase in expense in with an additional in  or  for the full year 
furniture and equipment expense totaled million in the current year  up  or  following a increase in over depreciation on equipment of  this year was up over  while equipment rent and personal property taxes posted higher numbers in all other expenses of million were up  or over in  the company recorded  in bankcard processing expense 
due to the sale of the credit card portfolio and the merchant account program  these expenses will decline significantly in the efficiency ratio  which measures non interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income  was in  and compared unfavorably to posted the previous year 
excluding  of merger related cost  the pro forma efficiency ratio for was 
the company experienced a higher effective tax rate during the increased effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to tax treatment of merger related cost recognized in the third quarter of secondly  the effective tax rate for was lowered because the company had minimum state taxes due to increased investment tax exempt income as a percentage of interest income 
this had the effect of decreasing the tax rate for financial condition the company s consolidated assets of million at year end increased over the previous year  following an increase of in growth in earning assets in occurred in both loans and investment securities  while saw a marked increase in outstanding loans 
supporting that growth this year were increases of in non interest bearing deposits  in interest bearing deposits and in other borrowings 
loan growth during was million  with outstanding loans up at year end  following increases of in and in loans secured by real estate were up and represented of total loans  compared with at year end within the category  commercial real estate loans increased  to a level of million 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans were up representing of total loans  compared with last year end 
consumer loans advanced led mainly by increases in home equity loans 
management believes the company is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers concentrated in a particular industry  the loss of whose deposits or whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations 
investment securities at amortized cost of million at year end were down million or over u 
s 
government agency securities continue to represent the major share of the total portfolio  although decreasing from of the portfolio at the end of to at year end management believes that the additional risk of owning agencies over u 
s 
treasury securities is negligible and has capitalized on the favorable spreads available on the former 
for the first time in two years the company was able to purchase tax exempt municipal securities in the latter part of the pricing in these securities turned favorable and will serve to boost total returns in future periods 
the company s investment portfolio goals are to achieve good total portfolio returns  within the context of remaining relatively short in maturity to fund loan growth and mitigate the unfavorable effect of interest rate increases 
to this end  the company has consistently categorized the entire portfolio as available for sale  which it believes offers the greatest amount of flexibility in managing a total return concept 
table on page presents the composition of the securities portfolio for the last three years  as well as information about cost  fair value and weighted average yield 
during the first half of  deposits rates trended downward in response to the decreases in interest rates precipitated by the federal reserve bank reducing short term interest rates in late this scenario provided little incentive for customers to choose longer term deposit at a minimal spread difference from shorter  more liquid products 
accordingly  retail deposit growth was concentrated in money market investment accounts  which have superior liquidity compared to a certificate of deposit while providing a competitive return to depositors 
the market for deposits remains fiercely competitive and the company relies on appropriate pricing and quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base 
for commercial customers  the company is focused on building a total relationship  which will foster growth in both loans and deposits 
in addition to traditional regular checking accounts  the company offers a cash management sweep account  with outstanding balances decreasing from million at the end of to million in in order to attract longer term deposits  the company maintains membership in an electronic network which allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits nationally 
as of december   the company had approximately certificates of deposit totaling million  with an overall rate of for the total portfolio 
this certificate portfolio has increased by million during overall  the certificates booked during were at lower rates than certificates booked during as a result  the portfolio rate declined from at december  to at december the primary focus of this funding source has been to provide longer term deposits to offset the demand for short term retail deposits 
however  current deposit rates in this market are trending upward and this may result in a higher overall rate on this certificate portfolio in the future if new deposits are booked 
the company also utilized a portion of its million line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets  with a year end balance outstanding of million 
management continues to believe this is a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since a particular amount and term may be selected to meet its current needs 
asset quality management believes that asset quality is of great importance 
the allowance for loan losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated probable charge offs of non collectible loans 
the loan portfolio is analyzed periodically in an effort to identify potential problems before they actually occur 
the company s allowance for loan losses is also analyzed quarterly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that segments the loan portfolio by selected loan types and considers the current status of the portfolio  historical charge off experience  current levels of delinquent  impaired and non performing loans  as well as economic and inherent risk factors 
the provision for loan losses represents a charge against income in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
the monthly provision for loan losses may fluctuate based on the results of this analysis 
table on page depicts a summary of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  through the allocation is based on management s grading of the loan portfolio with the remaining portion allocated to the general category  although the entire allowance is available to be used for write offs in any category 
the provision of million compares with million in and  in  which equals a increase in the total provision includes a one time increase of  charged against income during the third quarter to conform the policies of black diamond to those of fnb southeast 
credit quality continued strong and the level of non performing loans and charge offs has remained comparatively low 
net charge offs decreased in to a level of  or of average loans outstanding  compared with  the prior year and net recoveries of  in approximately of the net charge offs in were for two commercial loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of year end loans was  which represented an increase from at december  at december  and  the recorded investment in loans that were considered impaired was approximately  and  respectively 
the related allowance for loan losses on these impaired loans was approximately  and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
there were no loans on nonaccrual status that were not considered impaired at december  non performing assets include non accrual loans  accruing loans contractually past due days or more  restructured loans  other real estate and other real estate under contract for sale 
loans are placed on non accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan principal and interest and generally when such loans are days or more past due 
while non performing assets represent potential losses to the company  management does not anticipate any aggregate material losses  since most loans are believed to be adequately secured 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb known risks in the portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that economic conditions will not adversely affect borrowers and result in increased losses 
capital resources banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the federal reserve has adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are required to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to its assets in accordance with the guidelines 
as shown in table on page  in and the company and both subsidiary banks maintained capital levels exceeding the minimum levels for well capitalized banks and bank holding companies 
because of significant growth realized in  the levels fell to adequately capitalized by the end of capital levels were dramatically increased in when the company sold a total of  additional shares in a public offering during april and may  generating approximately million in new capital 
the result of this capital infusion was to restore the company and fnb southeast to well capitalized status at the end of effective in march  fnb southeast converted from a national bank  regulated by the occ  to a north carolina bank  regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks commissioner 
fnb southeast will continue to be required to meet certain levels of capital 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity management a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the company s primary earning component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the company s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment would have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates which are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap is a technique traditionally used in asset liability management 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
table on page indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december  to be 
this ratio indicates that net interest income would decline in a rising interest rate environment  since a greater amount of liabilities than assets would reprice more quickly over the one year period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  yet have no stated maturity 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
this analysis assumes of now and mmi accounts  and of savings accounts reprice within one year and the remaining balances reprice after one year 
furthermore  the overall risk to net interest income is further mitigated by the company s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio has variable rates  and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 
in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the company also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  rate shock net interest margin analysis  and asset liability term and rate analysis 
the company uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income for the company 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and reflects the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming twelve month period 
the company has an established policy to monitor interest rate risk 
the policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the company is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
liquidity management refers to the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the company s customers 
deposit withdrawals  loan funding and general corporate activity create a need for liquidity for the company 
liquidity is derived from sources such as deposit growth  maturity calls sales of investment securities  principal and interest payment on loans  access to borrowed funds or lines of credit  and profits 
the company s primary source of funds has been from increased deposit and sweep account balances 
liquidity is further enhanced by an million line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta collateralized by fhlb of atlanta stock and qualifying family residential mortgage loans 
there are unsecured overnight borrowing lines available through several financial institutions 
internal liquidity analysis indicates the company is well positioned to fund earning assets in the twelve month period analyzed 
interest rate risk management and liquidity management are both a part of the company s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the company s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the committee meets on a regular basis to review the asset liability management activities of the company and monitor compliance with established policies 
a member of the board of directors chairs the committee and reports on its activities to the full board 
year discussion over the past two years  the company has reported on its activities and state of readiness for the century date roll over 
the company has experienced no material or immaterial disruption of business activity related to the century date roll over  or any other dates such as february  in  the company budgeted  of year expense  and had actual year expense of  these expenditures only reflect the external cost of year compliance  and do not include personnel expense based on time devoted to this effort by employees 
new accounting pronouncements in june of  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
based on its operations at december   management does not expect this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial statements upon adoption 
effects of inflation inflation affects financial institutions in ways that are different from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on net interest margins as a major source of earnings 
non interest expenses  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment cost are also negatively affected by inflation 
recent events in february   the company sold its entire credit card portfolio of million to a third party 
the company received approximately a premium on this sale 
the loans were sold without recourse 
the company has entered into an agreement whereby its customers will be issued credit cards branded for either fnb southeast or black diamond through this third party and the company will receive income based on the level of future transactions generated by these customers 
related to this sale  the company has entered into an agreement to sell the merchant servicing business related to credit card transactions 
current merchant accounts will be serviced by a third party 
the company expects to have completed the merger of black diamond into fnb southeast in the beginning of the third quarter of on march  the company filed an application with the office of the commission of banks for the state of north carolina to merge black diamond into fnb southeast 
the effect of the merger  if approved  would be to operate black diamond locations as branches of fnb southeast 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk  which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the company is asset sensitive  which means that falling interest rates could result in a reduced amount of net interest income 
the monitoring of interest rate risk is discussed in interest rate sensitivity and liquidity management on page the company is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk
