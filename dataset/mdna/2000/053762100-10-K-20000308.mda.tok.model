item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  intends  plans and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under business business risks elsewhere in this form k 
overview since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
to date  we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products and do not expect to generate any revenues from the sale of products until at the earliest 
we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million as of december   and expect to incur substantial operating losses over at least the next several years 
we expect our research and development expenditures  which include pre marketing manufacturing expenses  to increase substantially over the next several years as we expand our research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trials with respect to certain of our programs  and early stage commercial manufacturing activities principally in regard to flumist 
in addition  general  administrative and marketing expenses are expected to continue to increase as we expand our operations and prepare for the potential commercial launch of flumist 
in february  we amended our agreement with the university of michigan to accelerate the issuance of a warrant to the university 
as a result of this amendment  we granted the university a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as a result of this amendment  we will record a one time charge of approximately million in the first quarter of upon the date of the first commercial sale of flumist  if percent of the common stock then outstanding exceeds  shares  we will issue an additional warrant allowing the university to purchase the excess shares on the same terms 
to motivate our employees and align their interests with our stockholders  on february   we granted options for the purchase of a total of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of  the closing price of our stock on february  approximately percent of the options become exercisable upon the acceptance by the fda of our bla submission and another percent become exercisable when flumist is approved for marketing in the united states 
these options will become exercisable in february unless these events related to flumist occur earlier 
the final percent of these options will become exercisable when flumist is approved for marketing in the united states  but only if this event occurs in if fda approval for flumist is not obtained by december   these options will be cancelled 
if the final percent of these options become exercisable  we anticipate incurring compensation expense in the period in which they become exercisable in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price of the options and the then current fair market value of our common stock 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we earned million in revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the revenues are comprised primarily of amounts earned from wyeth lederle under the flumist collaboration agreement  which included a non refundable initial payment in the amount of million  million in expense reimbursement from wyeth lederle for clinical and commercialization expenses  and revenues from other contracts and research grants 
the revenues were from a grant payment from the nih for research on our cytomegalovirus  or cmv  vaccine and from payments received for services rendered to other biotechnology companies 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in development activities  depreciation  documentation  validation  and other expenses associated with the commercial scale up of the manufacturing facilities associated with flumist 
we expect these expenses to increase in the future as development and manufacturing activities expand in preparation for potential commercialization of flumist 
general  administrative and marketing expenses increased to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to additional staffing  legal and other infrastructure costs necessary to support the development of flumist and other products 
these expenses are expected to increase in the future in continued support of these activities 
net interest income expense 
net interest decreased to a net expense of million for the year ended december   as compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest is due to a combination of increased interest expense associated with the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes on march  and decreased interest income associated with a reduction in the average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments as funds have been used to meet operating expenses and capital requirements 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  revenues for were comprised of payments under governmental research grants and contract revenue for services provided for others by our animal research facility

operating expenses 
research and development costs rose to million in from million in these increases were primarily due to increases in research and development activities and clinical trials of flumist and parainfluenza virus  or piv  vaccine  preclinical testing associated with other programs  and depreciation and other expenses associated with the documentation  validation  and test production at manufacturing facilities 
general  administrative and marketing costs rose to million in from million in this increase was due to increase in staffing and infrastructure costs and market research activities principally associated with the proposed commercial launch of flumist 
net interest income 
our net interest income decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  net interest income is the result of increased interest income on our increase in average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances  due to our public offering of common stock in august and the private offering of convertible subordinated notes in march  offset by the increase in interest expense related to these notes 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  of approximately million 
in order to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  our funds are invested primarily in united states treasury obligations  highly rated corporate obligations and other liquid investments 
through december   we raised approximately million from sales of equity and convertible debt securities  and debt financing 
during  we entered into two credit facilities that could provide a total of up to million of additional financing during and  of which we had drawn million at december  the credit facilities are secured by various assets and require the maintenance of a minimum balance of cash and investments in the amount of million 
the loans must be repaid over periods ranging from to months in amounts ranging from percent to percent of the original principal sum of each advance 
one of the credit facilities has a residual payment of percent of the original principal amount that will be due at the rd month 
no principal payments on our million unsecured convertible subordinated notes are required prior to recent financings on january   we received a commitment for up to million in equity financing from acqua wellington north america equities fund  ltd  or acqua wellington  in amounts of up to million per month  at our discretion  through january the commitment is reduced by million each month whether we draw on the commitment or not 
we currently have million of these funds available 
the price at which this equity is issued is based on the volume weighted average market price for the trading days ending two days prior to sale 
in addition to the above commitment  on march   we sold  shares of common stock to acqua wellington for total proceeds of million or approximately per share 
this price was based on the weighted average market price for the trading days period ending on march  on february   we sold  shares of common stock to ridgeway investment ltd  or ridgeway  for total proceeds of million or per share 
this share price was based on the volume weighted average market price for the trading days ending two days prior to sale 
on february   we sold  shares of common stock to ahp for total proceeds of million at the same share price and terms as those for the ridgeway investment described above 
on march   we sold  shares of common stock to ahp for total proceeds of million  or per share  which were sold pursuant to a december  agreement with ahp 
cash used in operations was million  million and million for  and respectively 
net cash used in operating activities increased primarily due to increased research and development expenditures 
we expect expenditures for research and development  clinical trials and marketing  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in as we develop our products  expand our clinical trials and prepare for the potential commercial launch of flumist 
cash expended for capital additions and to repay lease financing arrangements amounted to approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures decreased in primarily due to a decrease in the level of expenditures for our facilities and equipment at aviron pa and those at medeva  which is partially offset by increases in expenditures for our santa clara and mountain view facilities 
capital expenditures are expected to decrease during the year but are likely to increase in the future if we decide to expand our product development and manufacturing capabilities 
our flumist manufacturing agreement with medeva requires annual minimum payments which will total million british pounds sterling over the period from july to december we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  revenues from existing collaborations  and committed financing arrangements will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations until our future cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including continued scientific progress in the research and development of our technology and vaccine programs  the size and complexity of these programs  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the cost of constructing additional manufacturing facilities  should they be deemed necessary  and product commercialization activities 
income taxes at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the federal net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not utilized 
the state net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of see note of notes to financial statements for additional information on income taxes 
impact of year we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab among other things  sab discusses the sec staff s view on accounting for non refundable up front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sab on the accounting for up front license fees received from wyeth lederle 
should we determine that a change in its accounting policy is necessary  such a change will be made effective january  and would result in a charge to results of operations for the cumulative effect of the change 
this amount  if recognized  would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue in future periods 
prior financial statements would not be restated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates 
our investment and interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and investments 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  we place our investments that meet high credit standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of investment and does not permit derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
in addition  the average maturity of portfolio is less than one year 
as a result  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we pay for the costs of manufacturing and development activities  equipment  and facilities modifications at medeva  which is located in the united kingdom in british pounds sterling 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the united kingdom 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates in the united kingdom 
when the us dollar strengthens against the british pounds sterling  the us dollar value of british pounds sterling based expenses decreases  when the us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of british pounds sterling based expenses increases 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our financial position as expressed in us dollars 
we currently do not hedge our obligations in british pounds sterling 
cash  cash equivalents and investments 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  with a weighted average interest rate of percent per year  and short term investments with a basis of million and a fair value of million  with a weighted average interest rate of percent
