management s analysis of results of operations net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the year ended december  this followed a increase in  when revenues rose to million from million in  impacted by the inclusion of knott s berry farm  which was acquired on december  net revenues for reflect a increase in combined in park guest per capita spending and an increase of increase in out of park revenues  offset slightly by a decrease in combined attendance to million from million in 
in  knott s berry farm and dorney park both had record years  which nearly offset attendance declines at cedar point  valleyfair and worlds of fun caused by the lack of major new rides and some less than ideal weather conditions 
in  knott s berry farm s full year contribution accounted for most of the increase in combined attendance and revenues 
meanwhile  attendance at the partnership s original four parks was up over  due to the successful debuts of power tower at cedar point and mamba at worlds of fun  as well as improved weather at cedar point throughout the season 
in addition  dorney park achieved its second straight record year 
in  dorney park and worlds of fun both had excellent years  which nearly offset attendance declines at cedar point and valleyfair caused by unusually cool and wet weather during important parts of the season  and combined attendance was down to million 
combined guest per capita spending increased in and in costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization in increased to million from million in and million in  in part due to the inclusion of the buena park hotel s operations in and knott s berry farm s operations beginning in included in costs and expenses are approximately million of incentive fees earned by the general partner in this compares to million and million of incentive fees earned in and  respectively 
operating income in increased to million  following a increase in and a decrease in the increase in operating income was largely the result of increased revenues and operating margins at knott s berry farm  offset by higher depreciation expense from significant capital expenditures in recent years 
in  operating income increased as the result of increases in attendance and guest per capita spending at each of the partnership s original four parks  together with knott s berry farm s first full year profit contribution 
in  operating income decreased as the result of attendance declines at cedar point and valleyfair 
net income for increased to million compared to million in and million in in  interest expense rose due to higher short term interest rates and borrowings for the acquisitions of the buena park hotel in february and white water canyon in december 
the provision for partnership taxes  new in  increased in based on the increase in taxable revenues 
for  the partnership plans to invest a record million in capital improvements  including millennium force  the world s tallest and fastest roller coaster  and the breakers express hotel at cedar point  a major water ride and a multi million dollar water park at knott s berry farm  and valleyfair s new foot tall thrill ride  power tower 
an additional million has been invested in the renovation of the buena park hotel at knott s 
we are optimistic that these major investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in our market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance at our parks 
historically  the partnership has been able to improve its profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in its parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain consistently high attendance levels as well as steady increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
partnership financial condition the partnership ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of the partnership s highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
in  cash generated from operations totaled million and new bank borrowings totaled million 
the partnership used million for capital expenditures  for acquisitions  million for distributions to the general and limited partners  and million to repurchase limited partnership units on the open market 
distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in the partnership has available through april a million revolving credit facility  of which million was borrowed and in use as of december  an additional million revolving credit facility is available through november to fund peak seasonal requirements 
credit facilities and cash flow are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions 
additional year disclosure the partnership implemented all changes believed to be needed for its computer dependent rides and equipment and its internal information systems  and did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the year changed from to based on operations since january   the partnership does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  as daily operations at the partnership s seasonal parks will not begin until april and may of  it is possible that the full impact of the date change has not been fully recognized 
the partnership believes that any future problems  not yet recognized  are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the partnership s parks could be negatively impacted if its major utility or financial service providers are adversely affected by the year issue 
the partnership currently is not aware of any significant year problems that have arisen for its principal suppliers of essential utilities or financial services 
the partnership expended less than million in year readiness efforts from to these efforts included replacing some outdated  noncompliant hardware and reprogramming or replacing some noncompliant software
