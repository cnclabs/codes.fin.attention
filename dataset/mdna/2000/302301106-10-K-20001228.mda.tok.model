accounting change during the second quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of revenue recognition on pawn loans by reducing the accrual of pawn service charge revenues to the estimated amount that will be realized through loan collection  and recording forfeited collateral at the lower of the principal balance of the loan or estimated market value 
previously  pawn service charges were accrued on all loans  and the carrying value of the forfeited collateral was the lower of cost principal amount of loan plus accrued pawn service charges or market 
the company believes the new method of revenue recognition is preferable in that it better aligns reported net revenues and earnings with current economic trends in its business and the management of the company 
additionally  the new method improves the comparability of the company s financial position and operating results with similar companies 
this change was made effective october   the first day of the company s fiscal year 
during the period of time between the inception of a pawn loan and the later sale of the forfeited collateral  the change in accounting principle will not affect the amount of net revenues or earnings reported by the company 
it will affect only the timing of net revenues and earnings recognition 
the new method will more closely align net revenues and earnings recognition with the actual collection of cash from loan payments and the sale of forfeited collateral 
additionally  the new method will reduce the impact of short term or permanent changes in the market value of forfeited collateral on inventory reserve requirements 
in management s opinion  these factors will reduce the reliance upon accounting estimates in reporting the company s results of operations 
management has implemented changes in the company s operating practices and taken other actions  including the modification of employee compensation programs  to provide additional incentives for cash returns on capital employed 
adoption of the new accounting method is consistent with these actions and will present external financial statements on a basis more reflective of how the company is managed internally

the income earned on this activity is pawn service charge revenue 
for fiscal  pawn service charge revenue decreased million from fiscal to million as a result of a decrease in same store pawn service charge revenue million  offset somewhat by pawn service charge revenue from new stores not open the full month period million 
at september   same store pawn loan balances were below september  and the annualized yield on the average pawn loan balance increased percentage points to 
variations in the annualized loan yield  as we saw between these periods  are due generally to changes in loan redemption rates and a mix shift between loans with different yields

this excess inventory had a cost basis of approximately million and generated cash proceeds of approximately million 
for fiscal  gross margins on merchandise sales decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
of the total decrease  percentage points were attributable to a decline in margins on merchandise sales

in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased of a percentage point from fiscal to 
exclusive of stores opened in the past two years  store operating expenses decreased from in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal newer stores generally have a higher level of operating expense relative to revenues than do mature stores

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding restructuring expenses of million and the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  the company s most significant item in reconciling net loss to cash flow from operations was a million decrease in inventory  compared to a million increase in inventory in the year earlier period 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal declined to million compared to million provided in fiscal  primarily due to the million increase in the company s inventory  partially offset by smaller changes in other working capital accounts 
in fiscal  the company invested million in property  equipment  and an unconsolidated affiliate 
these investments and a million net reduction of bank borrowings were funded by cash flow from operating activities  a million decrease in pawn loans  and million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company ceased its store expansion and prior to september   committed to close fifty four unprofitable stores as part of its restructuring  twenty three of which were closed by september  excluding these stores  cash flow from operations would have been approximately million higher in fiscal during fiscal  the company also plans to sell certain non core assets and complete sale leaseback transactions of some of its owned properties 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction will be adequate to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and mandatory debt payments during the coming year 
however  there can be no assurance that the sale of these assets will be completed or that cash flow from operating activities will be adequate for these expenditures 
on december   the company amended and restated its million secured credit agreement  which matures december  the amended credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility and two term loan facilities totaling million 
availability under the revolving credit facility will be tied to pawn loan and inventory balances 
the term facilities require principal payments of million during fiscal these principal payments will be made from operating cash flow  the sale of assets  primarily sale leaseback transactions of various owned properties  and a tax refund resulting from the company s fiscal operating loss 
interest on the facility will be tied to the agent bank s prime rate plus to basis points 
the company pays a commitment fee of basis points on the unused amount of the revolving facility 
earlier in fiscal  the company amended its million credit agreement in an amendment dated march  among other provisions  this amendment reduced the aggregate commitment under the facility to million  secured the facility with substantially all the assets of the company  and adjusted the interest rates charged on outstanding borrowings 
the company believes that the financial covenants established in the amended and restated credit facility will be achieved based upon the company s current and anticipated performance 
based upon management s fiscal operating plan  including the sale leaseback of certain assets and the availability under the revolving credit facility  the company believes that there is adequate liquidity to fund the company s operations and to make the required principal payments under the two term loans during fiscal however  material shortfalls or variances from anticipated performance or the delay in the sale of certain of its assets could require the company to seek a further amendment to the amended and restated credit facility or alternate sources of financing  or to limit capital expenditures to an amount less than that currently anticipated or permitted under the amended and restated credit facility 
seasonality historically  pawn service charge revenues are highest in the fourth fiscal quarter july  august and september due to higher loan demand during the summer months and merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and tax refunds
