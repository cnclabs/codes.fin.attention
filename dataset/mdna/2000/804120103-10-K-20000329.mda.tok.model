several of the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  at february   an aggregate of approximately  was available for borrowing under the facilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures commitments at december   our commitments for capital expenditures were not material 
overall liquidity our liquidity is contingent upon a number of factors  principally our future operating results 
management believes that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and to fund our capital investment needs and debt service payments 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on our results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on our purchase of inventory from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
we are  however  subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign currency denominated payables 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize certain transaction currency risk 
year we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems relating to distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates  which generally are referred to as year problems 
we are also not aware of any material year problems with our clients or vendors 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems in the future 
we incurred year costs of approximately and during fiscal and  respectively  in prevention costs relating to anticipated year problems 
accounting pronouncements sfas and sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas as amended by financial accounting standards no 
 a deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years commencing after june   with early adoption permitted 
sfas defines the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities 
upon adoption of sfas  all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value and any deferred gains or losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet 
in the period of adoption  the transition adjustments may effect current earnings and may effect other comprehensive income 
sfas requires companies to recognize adjustments to the fair value of derivatives that are not hedges currently in earnings when they occur 
for derivatives that qualify as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives can be recognized currently in earnings  along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis of the underlying hedged item or be deferred in other comprehensive income 
the company is assessing the impact of the provisions of sfas on its hedging activities  which are currently limited to forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on current earnings or on the company s financial position  however  at this time  the effect of the adoption of sfas on the company s future earnings and financial position cannot be estimated

in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements  all of which are expressly qualified by the statement in this section 
certain other factors that may affect future results we face intense competition competition is intense in the markets in which we sell our products 
we compete with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which have diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than ours 
the principal competitors for our saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors for our hind products are nike  pearl izumi and tyr 
the principal competitors for our quintana roo  merlin and real design products are cannondale  trek and litespeed 
we compete based on a variety of factors  including price  quality  product design  brand image  marketing and promotion and ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a technological breakthrough or marketing or promotional success by one of our competitors could adversely affect our competitive position 
the intensity of the competition that we face constitutes a significant risk to our business 
we depend on foreign suppliers a number of manufacturers located in asia  primarily in china  taiwan and thailand  supply products and product components to us 
during fiscal  one of our suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of our total purchases by dollar volume 
we are subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
in particular  there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our foreign suppliers and compete with other athletic shoe  apparel and bicycle companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
we need to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and merchandise trends the footwear and apparel industries are subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
demand for our products  particularly our originals line  may be adversely affected by changing fashion trends and consumer style preferences 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
in addition  our decisions concerning new product designs often need to be made several months before we can determine consumer acceptance 
as a result  our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or features could lead to problems such as excess inventories and higher markdowns  lower gross margins due to the necessity of providing discounts to retailers  as well as the inability to sell such products through our own factory stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our revenues and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including o the timing and shipment of individual orders  o market acceptance of footwear and other products offered by us  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o mix of products sold  o changes in product pricing  and  o general economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact the results of operations for a particular quarter 
our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we conduct operations in various international countries and a portion of our sales is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  our financial results have been adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to protect us from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful and currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns the footwear  apparel and bicycle industries are generally characterized by significant seasonality of sales and results of operations 
sales of our saucony brand products have historically been seasonal in nature  with the strongest sales generally occurring in the first and third quarters 
in addition  sales of our hind brand products are generally strongest in the third and fourth quarters due to the popularity of the hind winter apparel collection 
we believe that sales of our products will continue to follow this seasonal cycle 
therefore  our results of operations for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
we are susceptible to financial difficulties of retailers we sell our products primarily to major retailers  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect the future financial condition of such retailers will have on our business 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that our bad debt expenses may be material in future periods 
we need effective marketing and advertising programs because consumer demand for our products is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising 
failure of such investments to achieve the desired effect in terms of increased retailer acceptance or consumer purchase of our products could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we believe that our success depends in part upon our ability to periodically launch new marketing and advertising programs 
if we are unable to successfully design or execute new marketing and advertising  or if such programs are ineffective  our business will suffer 
we depend on certain key customers during  we derived approximately of our consolidated revenue from sales to a single major customer  venator  which operates foot locker  lady foot locker  kids foot locker and eastbay running stores 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will depend to a significant extent upon sales to major customers 
the loss of or a reduction in the level of sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a major customer were unable or unwilling to proceed with a large order or to pay us for a large order on a timely basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business our business is sensitive to consumers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions  such as interest and taxation rates  employment levels and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates and foreign currency rate changes is to limit impact of the changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in order to achieve these objectives we identify the risks and manage them by adjusting fixed and variable rate debt positions and selectively hedging foreign currency risks 
almost all of our borrowings are based on floating rates  which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
we have a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  but there are no assurances that this program will fully insulate against short term fluctuations in financial results 
we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a month period and also a change in certain foreign currency rates over the same period and determined the effects to be immaterial 
we do not expect to make any significant changes in our management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the foreseeable future
