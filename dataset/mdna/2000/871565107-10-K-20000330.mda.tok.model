results of operations metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note q to consolidated financial statements 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling and administrative expense    environmental remediation costs operating income    year end backlogs piping systems    comparison of to sales increased percent producing the  increase in operating income to  after six consecutive quarters of declines in unit volume growth compared to the same quarter the previous year  the final three quarters of experienced significant increases resulting in a percent increase in unit volumes over the unit volume increase came primarily from commodity stainless pipe sales resulting from improved demand in the united states coupled with an increase in demand world wide and a reduction of imports following anti dumping judgments on stainless steel 
the most important development in the metals segment during was the reversal of the relentless downtrend in stainless commodity pipe prices that had been evident since late when prices bottomed in the second quarter  they were barely half of the level reached in average prices gained eight percent in the fourth quarter ending the year with a nine percent decline for the year compared to last year 
the fourth quarter increase came from the company s ability to pass along price increases incurred from its stainless steel suppliers 
piping systems and process equipment sales also improved significantly as unit volumes increased nine percent in over the prior year 
gross profits in almost doubled to  compared to as a result of the increase in unit volume offset somewhat by the selling price decline 
selling and administrative expenses were seven percent of sales  consistent with last year 
higher sales commissions  profit based incentives and an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts accounted for the percent increase over the prior year

comparison of to sales declined percent producing much lower operating income of  after six years of noteworthy unit volume growth  showed a percent decline because of lower demand and a surge in imports 
the unit volume decline came from lower commodity stainless pipe sales resulting primarily from a surge in cheap imports coupled with significantly low piping systems and process equipment sales 
the company chose not to compete for business when pricing was driven solely by low priced imports  as average prices for commodity pipe declined eight percent for the year compared to last year 
lower gross profits were caused by low plant utilization rates  more competitive pricing for pipe  and a loss from piping systems 
although the stainless steel fabrication shop about broke even  a  loss was incurred in the carbon pipe fabrication shop opened in low demand in the pulp and paper industry resulting in lower unit volumes caused the poor performance in piping systems 
lower sales commissions and profit based incentives accounted for the nine percent decline in selling and administrative expenses

chemicals segment the following table summarizes operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note q to consolidated financial statements 
amounts in thousands amount amount net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling and administrative expense    environmental remediation costs  operating income  comparison of to the chemical segment experienced a sales decline of two percent for the year and operating income fell significantly to  from s total of  before deducting a  special charge for environmental remediation costs 
colors sales were down six percent 
without the acquisition of organic pigments on july   total chemicals segment sales would have declined percent and colors sales would have been down percent 
the decline resulted from the continued downsizing of the domestic textile industry  weak domestic demand and lower selling prices 
sales of specialty chemicals improved three percent because of higher demand from several toll projects during compared to this modest increase is well below the growth rate that the company expects from these products 
unprecedented problems with the start up of an agricultural product under a processing agreement led to a significant commitment of time and resources in with negligible related revenues 
the combination of weaker pricing and demand for color products  low level of capacity utilization in both colors and specialty chemicals  and to a lesser extent  the startup problems mentioned above contributed to the decline in gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses increased six percent over the prior year because of having a full year of expense from the organic acquisition compared to six months last year  and an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts 
for information related to environmental matters  see note h to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to the chemicals segment experienced a sales decline of seven percent for the year and operating income fell significantly to  or  before the special charge for environmental remediation costs 
both colors and specialty chemicals experienced a decline in sales from the prior year 
colors sales were down two percent 
without the acquisition of organic pigments on july   total chemicals segment sales would have declined percent and colors sales would have been down percent 
the continued downsizing of the domestic textile industry  because of low cost imports  led to less unit volume demand for colors compared to a year earlier 
sales prices were also lower continuing the deflationary trend that has been evident for several years 
sales of specialty chemicals were down percent because of lower demand for certain products and sales in from a toll project that ended in december the combination of weaker pricing for color products and low level of capacity utilization in both colors and specialty chemicals contributed to the decline in gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses increased percent because of the organic acquisition and additions to the sales staff

unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note q to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of these items 
comparison of to the percent increase in corporate expenses resulted from salary increases and higher profit based incentives 
interest expense offset by interest income was higher in  as borrowings increased under the line of credit with a bank  and interest income declined 
the company had borrowings under the line of credit throughout compared to having cash invested most of comparison of to the percent decrease in corporate expenses resulted from lower profit based incentives and professional fees 
the company benefited from lower interest expense on reduced borrowings under the line of credit with a bank  and higher interest income earned on cash invested during the year 
current conditions and outlook the metals segment delivered a sterling performance in the fourth quarter with sales up percent to  and operating income of  up over fifteen times the depressed level of a year earlier 
this resulted from a combination of percent higher unit volume and a percent increase in average selling price 
the higher average price resulted from a shift in product mix to a larger percentage of sales from piping systems and process equipment 
more significantly  on a sequential basis  sales were up seven percent and operating income was percent higher than in the previous quarter when the earnings recovery began to gather momentum 
prices for commodity pipe in december were about percent above the year lows experienced in the second quarter of  and recent increases in stainless steel flat product prices make management optimistic that stainless pipe prices will continue their upward trend 
the outlook for piping systems remains excellent 
although the backlog of  is down percent from a year earlier  management expects an increase in profits from these products in compared to if the factors above continue as expected  and if demand continues to be strong  the metals segment should deliver excellent results in although chemicals segment sales of  in the fourth quarter were down percent  modest operating income of  was an improvement over the  loss suffered in the last quarter of before a  environmental charge 
colors sales were down five percent from the fourth quarter of factors causing the sales decline were identical to those experienced throughout the year as discussed in the chemicals segment analysis 
management hopes to arrest the slide in color sales and reestablish growth by introduction of vat dyes which are a promising new product line for the company  technical improvements to its sulfur dyes which should make them more competitive and sales of pigments to non textile users 
new business from each of these initiatives has already been booked and should reflect an increasing contribution from them as the year progresses 
specialty chemicals produced five percent higher revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter last year  and represented almost half of the segment s sales for the quarter 
the timing of production under certain toll contracts caused the increase 
during november  the chemicals segment was reorganized into two product groups to become effective january  the colors group includes the blackman uhler dyes and pigments at the spartanburg plant and the pigments produced at organic pigments in greensboro 
the chemicals group includes manufacturers chemicals in cleveland  tennessee  the plant in augusta  georgia  and the specialty chemicals produced in the spartanburg plant 
this realignment is expected to intensify management s focus and generate benefits from the natural synergy between the different plants within the product groups
