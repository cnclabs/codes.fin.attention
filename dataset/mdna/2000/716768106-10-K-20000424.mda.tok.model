item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled petsmart superstores  distribution  information systems  competition  government regulation and business risks included in this form k for the year ended january  overview fiscal year was a year of significant events for petsmart

additionally  the company transferred operational control of the united states veterinary clinics owned by petsmart veterinary services  inc to a third party operator  medical management international  inc mmi in exchange for an equity interest in mmi and a license agreement to rent space in the existing petsmart stores 
the company expects that future increases in net sales and net income  if any  will be dependent on the opening of additional superstores and the improved performance of existing superstores 
in view of the increasing maturity of its superstore base years as of year end  as well as the planned opening of additional superstores  net of relocations  in existing markets and single store markets  the company anticipates that comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of its expansion plans  the company anticipates the timing of new superstore openings  and related preopening expenses  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing superstores may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
the company has achieved less favorable operating results in certain north american geographic regions it recently entered than it has achieved historically in other regions 
in addition  because new superstores have higher payroll  advertising and other store operating expenses as a percentage of sales than mature superstores  the impact of new superstore openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
commencing with the first quarter of fiscal  the company charges preopening costs associated with each new superstore to earnings as the costs are incurred
