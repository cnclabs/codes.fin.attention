the accounts receivable increase in is primarily due to the december  balance being significantly lower than usual as a result of the collection of approximately million in contract payments during the month of december the days sales outstanding as of december  is in line with our historical days sales outstanding 
the receivable balance will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of contract milestones and time and material billings

should the company s business expand more rapidly than expected  the company believes that additional bank credit  if necessary  would be available to fund such operating and capital requirements 
the company believes that its business is generally not seasonal  however  the company has historically experienced  and can be expected to continue to experience  a certain degree of variability in its quarterly revenue  earnings and cash flow patterns 
this variability is typically driven by significant events which directly impact the recognition and billing of project related revenues 
examples of such events include the timing of new business contract closings and the initiation of product and service fee revenue recognition  one time payments from existing clients relative to license expansion rights required to process a greater number of customer accounts or expand the number of permitted users and completion of implementation project roll outs and the related revenue recognition 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client projects  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as noted earlier  however  the company believes that over the course of time the ongoing monthly revenue stream associated with the e profile outsourcing alternative will result in more predictable quarter to quarter revenues 
forward looking statements the company s forward looking statements about its revenues  earnings  market predictions and business development have been derived from its operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon detailed assumptions about many important factors 
several important factors may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward looking statements made by the company 
these factors include the demand for products and services in the financial services industry  competition among software and operational and technology outsourcing companies serving that industry  the timing of new contract closings  the potential delays in the implementation of products and services  the success of the company s e profile business model  e profile s limited operating history  the extent to which the internet will be used for financial services and products and other significant events of revenue recognition affecting the company s quarterly results  the development of the top tier and direct banking markets  market acceptance of the company s products and services within these markets  the company s ability to protect its intellectual property rights  the risks inherent in expansion  the potential adverse impact of security breaches and the company s ability to continue to improve its products and services 
several of the foregoing factors could also effect the market predictions of the company and those set forth in industry reports discussed above
