the revolving loans bear interest at ibj whitehall s alternate base rate i plus one half of one percent a total of per annum at december   and the term loan bears interest at such alternate based rate ii plus three quarters of one percent a total of per annum at december

cash and cash equivalents and the timely collection of its receivables provide the spar group s current liquidity

the spar group is obligated  under certain circumstances  to pay severance compensation to its employees and other costs in connection with the merger of approximately million 
in addition  the company incurred substantial cost in connection with the transaction  including legal  accounting and investment banking fees estimated to be an aggregate unpaid obligation of approximately million 
the spar group has also accrued approximately million for expenses incurred by pia prior to the merger  which have not been paid 
management believes the current bank credit facilities are sufficient to fund operations  and working capital  including the current maturities of debt obligations  but may not be sufficient to reduce obligations of the merger with pia 
the company is currently negotiating with its bank for an increase in its credit facility to meet the non operational credit needs and is also working to secure additional long term capital 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these negotiations 
the transfer of the company s securities to the nasdaq smallcap market also could affect its ability to raise equity capital
