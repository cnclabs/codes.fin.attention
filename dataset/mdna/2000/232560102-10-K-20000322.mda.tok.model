item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of cygnus  inc 
cygnus  the company  we  our  us  and actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption risk factors contained below in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as under business above  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events 
general we are engaged in the development and manufacture of diagnostic medical devices  utilizing proprietary technologies to satisfy unmet medical needs cost effectively 
our current efforts are primarily focused on a frequent  automatic and non invasive glucose monitoring device  the glucowatch registered trademark system  and enhancements thereto 
in  we sold substantially all of our drug delivery business to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  and chose to focus on glucose monitoring systems 
the drug delivery business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and prior years financial statements have been restated to report only continuing operations 
for us to remain competitive  we will need to develop  in license or acquire new diagnostic products 
our results of operations vary significantly from year to year and have depended on  among other factors  the signing of new product development agreements and the timing of recognizing payment amounts specified thereunder  the timing of recognizing license or distribution fees and cost reimbursement payments made by pharmaceutical licensees  and the demand for our products 
the level of revenues in any given period is not necessarily indicative of expected revenues for future periods 
in  of our revenues were attributable to one customer 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and do not believe we will achieve profitability in at december   our accumulated deficit and net capital deficiency were approximately million and million  respectively 
results of operations the drug delivery business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and prior years financial statements have been restated to report only continuing operations 
as a result no product revenues  royalty revenues or costs of products sold have been reflected in our financial statements 
comparison for the years ended december  and contract revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect the amortization of previously deferred and additional milestone payments relating to the glucowatch system 
the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to the amortization of an additional milestone payment received in in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with yamanouchi pharmaceutical co  ltd 
for the commercialization of the glucowatch biographer in japan and korea 
cygnus is eligible to receive milestone payments prior to commercialization and to receive a percentage of the product s future commercial success in japan and korea 
in september  we were awarded a six month phase i small business innovative research grant for high performance biosensor electrode materials from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases division of the nih in the amount of million 
we are using the funding to investigate advancements in biosensor materials used for glucose detection and measurement  potentially to include in future versions of the glucowatch system 
revenue is recognized as reimbursable expenses are incurred 
contract revenues  if any  are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and future contract revenues  if any  cannot be reasonably predicted 
the contributing factors to achieving contract revenues include  but are not limited to  future successes in finalizing new collaborative agreements  achievement of milestones under our current contract  and strategic decisions on self funding certain projects 
we are unable to predict to what extent the termination of any existing contracts or new collaborative agreements  if any  will impact overall contract revenues in and subsequent future periods 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a reduction in clinical studies and development expenditures associated with the glucowatch system 
research  development and clinical activities primarily included support and development for the glucose monitoring program 
we anticipate that the development of new products and technologies  along with additional clinical trials  will result in an increase in our overall research and development expenses in marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced compensation and market research expenses 
we expect that marketing  general and administrative expenses will increase in as we plan for possible regulatory approval and commercialization of our glucowatch system 
interest income expense  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the recording in of the i million non cash costs of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the october restructuring of the senior subordinated convertible notes and ii write off of the previously deferred debt issuance cost of million  in conjunction with the partial repayment of the senior subordinated convertible notes  offset by a net arbitration settlement with pharmacia upjohn from which cygnus received million 
income from operations of discontinued segment for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a decrease in overall segment expenses 
discontinued operations 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our drug delivery business to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc total revenues and net income on the discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we also recorded a gain of million on the disposal of the segment 
comparison for the years ended december  and contract revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflected the amortization of previously deferred milestone payments relating to our glucowatch system 
the decrease in contract revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in amortization of these milestone payments 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to the increased costs associated with the glucowatch biographer and the autosensor in the following areas material  design and scale up for development efforts  and material and outside charges for the accelerated level of clinical activities 
research and development and clinical activities primarily included support and development for the glucose monitoring program 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the glucowatch system  in particular marketing research expenses 
interest income expense  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the million non cash costs of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the october restructuring of the senior subordinated convertible notes  the interest expense associated with the subordinated convertible debt  the amortization of the financing fees related to this debt and the interest related to the additional long term debt incurred in the second quarter of income loss from operations of discontinued segment for the year ended december  was a profit of million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the change was due primarily to a non recurring arbitration settlement expense with sanofi of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as of december  totaled million  representing an increase of million from the total as of december  as of december   we had a negative net worth of million 
through december  we have received net proceeds of approximately million from public offerings of our common stock 
through december  we financed approximately million of manufacturing and research equipment under capital loan and lease arrangements 
borrowings under those arrangements are secured by specific cygnus assets 
we have an outstanding bank loan with silicon valley bank that requires monthly principal and interest payments through november  in addition to compliance with various financial covenants 
as of december  there was million outstanding under this agreement 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by specific cygnus assets 
in february  we entered into note purchase agreements with institutional investors to issue and sell approximately million of senior subordinated convertible notes due the notes 
on october   we restructured the notes 
key provisions in the restructured notes include the october repayment of million in principal reducing the principal balance from million to million  a delay in the convertibility of the majority of the notes to september   modification of conversion prices of the notes  our ability to redeem at par at any time all or part of the new principal amount of the notes  an increase in the interest rate to paid annually on the new principal balance and a change in the final maturity of the notes to october  through june   million was converted into common stock at a price of per share and million was converted into common stock at a price of per share 
the remaining million and accrued interest was redeemed in july in june  we entered into a convertible debenture and warrant purchase agreement with institutional investors to issue and sell up to million principal amount of five year convertible debentures 
in june  we issued million principal amount of convertible debentures due june  at par 
on september  we issued principal amount of convertible debentures due september  at par 
on june   we also entered into a structured equity line flexible financing agreement 
the equity line is effective for two years and allows us  at our sole discretion  to sell shares of our common stock with a maximum aggregate sales price of up to million 
on june  we received million from the sale of a total of thousand shares of common stock under the equity line 
on september   we received an additional million in exchange for a total of thousand shares of common stock pursuant to the equity line agreement 
in december  we sold thousand shares of common stock for million 
in january  we sold an additional thousand shares of common stock for million pursuant to the equity line 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
in addition to the cash received from the offerings  issuance of notes  equity line  equipment lease and short term working capital financing  we have financed our operations primarily through revenues and interest income 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash used of million for year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to the net loss from continuing operations of million  and decreases in deferred compensation and other liabilities of million  offset by a decrease in deferred compensation  prepaid expenses and other assets of million and accounts receivable of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and debt issuance and financing costs and debt discount of million 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to our net loss of million and a million cash payment made in january to sanofi under the terms of the arbitration settlement  offset by the non cash beneficial conversion costs of million associated with the october restructuring of the notes  an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and amortization of debt issuance and financing costs and debt discount of million 
the current level of cash used in operating activities is not necessarily indicative of the level of future cash usage 
we expect an increase in operating cash usage for net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the receipt of million from the sale of the drug delivery business  net sales of investments of million  offset by capital expenditures of million and a contract termination fee of million in conjunction with disposal of the drug delivery segment 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  includes  as mentioned above  net proceeds of million and million from the june and september issuance of convertible debentures and from the sale of common stock under the equity line  respectively  and additional stock proceeds of million  offset by the july redemption of senior subordinated convertible notes of million  and long term debt and capital lease repayments of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  includes  as mentioned above  net proceeds of million and million from our february issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes and from a direct public offering of our common stock  respectively  additional stock proceeds of million and million from the issuance of long term debt  offset by a subordinated debt principal repayment of million  and long term debt and capital lease repayments of million and million  respectively 
our long term capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time required to obtain regulatory approvals  the resources that we devote to the development of self funded products  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to obtain additional licensing arrangements and to manufacture products under those arrangements  the additional expenditures to support the manufacture of new products  if and when approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
as we evaluate the progress of our development projects  in particular the glucowatch system and our enhanced glucose monitoring products in development  our commercialization plans and the lead time to set up manufacturing capabilities  we may commence long term planning for another manufacturing site 
nevertheless  we believe that such long term planning will not result in any material impact on cash flows and liquidity for the next twelve months 
based upon current expectations for operating losses and projected short term capital expenditures  we believe that existing unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december   when coupled with cash from revenues and other funding  such as from potential product funding collaborations or from public financings including debt or equity financings and earnings from investments  will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt servicing and repayments and capital expenditure requirements at least through december  however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing  depending upon future business strategies  manufacturing and commercialization efforts  results of clinical trials and management decisions to accelerate certain research and development programs and other factors 
income taxes 
we recorded a million income tax provision consisting entirely of foreign withholding taxes for the year ended december  as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a substantial portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe these systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately thousand during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
risk factors we wish to caution stockholders and investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of cygnus 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
our product pipeline is severely limited 
with the sale of the majority of the drug delivery business assets to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  and the termination of the remaining drug delivery projects  we are now exclusively focused on diagnostic medical devices  initially on a line of frequent  automatic and non invasive glucose monitoring devices 
there is an inherent risk in not having a broad base of products in development and we cannot assure you that we will be successful with this narrow line of products 
we may not receive fda approval on our products 
although the fda s clinical chemistry and toxicology devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee has recommended the glucowatch biographer for approval for sale with three conditions  there can be no assurance that we can meet these conditions or  if we can  that the recommendation of the advisory committee will convince the fda to approve the product 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the fda will approve the glucowatch biographer on the same terms  if at all 
furthermore  as we seek regulatory approval for enhancements and possible manufacturing changes through the pma supplement process  there can be assurances that such supplements will be approved or that one or more new pmas will not need to be filed 
even if we receive the necessary regulatory approvals for the glucowatch system  there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur in product manufacturing and commercial scale up or marketing or product distribution 
any such occurrence could significantly delay the commercialization of the glucowatch system or prevent its market introduction entirely 
furthermore  even if the glucowatch system is successfully developed  the commercial success of the glucowatch system will depend on its acceptance in the market 
we have limited marketing  distribution  manufacturing and sales experience 
we have limited experience marketing  distributing  manufacturing or selling medical device products 
to successfully market  distribute  manufacture and sell the glucowatch system or our other glucose monitoring products under development  we must either develop a more extensive marketing  distributing  manufacturing and sales force or enter into arrangements with third parties to market  distribute  manufacture and sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop a more extensive marketing  distributing  manufacturing and sales force or that we will enter into acceptable marketing  distributing  manufacturing and sales agreements with third parties 
if we maintain our own marketing  distributing  manufacturing and sales capabilities  we will compete with other companies that have experienced and well funded marketing  distributing  manufacturing and sales operations 
if we enter into a marketing arrangement with a third party  any revenues we receive will depend on the third party  and we will likely have to pay a sales commission or similar amount 
we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products 
we cannot predict the market acceptance of our products 
we are focusing our efforts predominantly on a line of frequent  automatic  and non invasive glucose monitoring devices 
no one can predict market acceptance or penetration of such products  given that they are entirely different from any glucose diagnostic product currently on the market 
there is a risk in introducing a very new type of product in a market of established finger stick glucose monitors  and we cannot assure you that our products will be accepted or to what degree 
additionally  some of our competitors have announced  and others may be developing  new  frequent  automatic  and non invasive or minimally invasive  semi invasive or less invasive glucose monitoring devices 
we cannot predict what impact introduction of competing products will have on our market sales 
we depend on proprietary technology 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products  preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  both in the us and abroad 
since currently patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until issuance  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discovery by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first to file our patent applications or that we will not infringe upon third party patents 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued or upheld with respect to any of our patent applications or that any patents will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our licensees  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
any litigation  in the us or abroad  as well as foreign opposition and or domestic interference proceedings  could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
we may resort to litigation to enforce our patents or protect trade secrets or know how  as well as to defend against infringement charges 
a negative determination in such proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical product area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products  and could materially adversely affect us 
we face intense competition 
the medical device industry in general  and the market in which we expect to offer the glucowatch system in particular  is intensely competitive 
even if we successfully develop the glucowatch system  we will compete with other providers of personal glucose monitors 
a number of our competitors are currently marketing traditional glucose monitors 
these monitors are widely accepted in the healthcare industry and have long histories of accuracy and effective use 
furthermore  a number of companies have announced that they are developing products that permit less painful or painless  as well as continual or continuous  glucose monitoring 
accordingly  we expect competition to increase 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and have greater name recognition and lengthier operating histories in the healthcare industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors 
additionally  we cannot assure you that the glucowatch system or our other enhanced products under development will replace any currently used devices or systems 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing  even before we develop and commercialize the glucowatch system or our other enhanced products under development  devices and technologies that permit more efficient and less expensive glucose monitoring devices 
pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies may also develop therapeutic drugs  treatments or other products that will substantially reduce the prevalence of diabetes or otherwise render our products obsolete 
third parties may not reimburse patients  hospitals and physicians for the costs of medical devices 
successful commercialization of certain of our products may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party healthcare payers  such as private insurance plans and the government 
there can be no assurance that such reimbursement will be available 
third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic and diagnostic products 
there can be no assurance that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available to enable us to achieve market acceptance of the glucowatch system or other new products under development or to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment 
in certain international countries  the period of time needed to obtain such reimbursement can be lengthy 
we may delay the launch of our products in certain countries until eligibility for reimbursement is established 
this could potentially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred substantial losses  have a history of operating losses  have an accumulated deficit and expect continued operating losses 
we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  and have experienced annual operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses at least until we have significant sales  if we ever do  of the glucowatch system 
we cannot assure you that we will generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
we do not have experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling our medical device products 
our future development efforts may not result in commercially viable products 
we may fail in our efforts to introduce our products or to obtain required regulatory clearances 
our products may never gain market acceptance  and we may never generate revenues or achieve profitability 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from product development and licensing fees related to our products under development  and manufacturing and royalty revenues from our discontinued operations  including nicotrol registered trademark pharmacia ab  stockholm  sweden nicotine patch and the fempatch registered trademark warner lambert co  morris plains  new jersey system 
as a result of the sale of our drug delivery business  we will no longer receive manufacturing revenue or royalty payments from the nicotrol patch or the fempatch system 
if we obtain regulatory approvals  we expect that a substantial portion of our future revenues will be derived from sales of the glucowatch system and other diagnostic products currently under development 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to service our debt 
as of december   we had indebtedness of approximately million 
the degree to which we are leveraged could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our future performance  which will depend upon financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
although we believe our cash flows will be adequate to meet our interest payments  we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate cash flows in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges or to permit us to satisfy any redemption obligations pursuant to our indebtedness 
if we cannot generate cash flows in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges or to permit us to satisfy any redemption obligations pursuant to our indebtedness  and we cannot borrow sufficient funds either under our credit facilities or from other sources  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell all or a portion of our assets  or to sell equity securities 
there is no assurance that we could successfully refinance  sell our assets or sell equity securities  or  if we could  we cannot give any assurance as to the amount of proceeds we could realize 
in the event of insolvency  bankruptcy  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or winding up of our business or upon default or acceleration relating to our debt obligations  our assets will first be available to pay the amounts due under our debt obligations 
holders of common stock would only receive the assets remaining  if any  after payment of all indebtedness and preferred stock 
we may need additional financing and it may not be available 
in order to continue to develop our diagnostic products  we will require substantial resources to conduct research and development and clinical trials necessary to bring our products to market and to establish production and marketing capabilities 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including debt or equity financings 
we may also seek other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
any additional equity financings may dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may restrict our ability to issue dividends in the future and take other actions 
we may not be able to obtain adequate funds when we need them from financial markets or arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
even if funds are available  they may not be on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain sufficient additional funds  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs or license or sell products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  plus cash from revenues  other fundings such as potential product funding collaborations or financings  and earnings from investments  will suffice to meet our operating expenses  debt servicing and repayments and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of the year the amounts and timing of future expenditures will depend on progress of ongoing research and development  results of clinical trials  rates at which operating losses are incurred  executing possible development and licensing agreements with corporate partners  developing our products  manufacturing scale up for the glucowatch system  the fda regulatory process  and several other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we depend on licensees  distributors and collaborative arrangements 
our strategy to develop  clinically test  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and commercialize our products depends  in large part  upon our ability to selectively enter into and maintain collaborative arrangements with third party partners  distributors  licensees  and other such parties 
if we commercialize our glucowatch system  we will depend upon yamanouchi pharmaceutical co  ltd 
to market and distribute the glucowatch system in japan and korea 
we do not have any marketing or distribution agreements for the glucowatch system other than the yamanouchi collaboration 
one of our priorities is to establish an alliance or alliances for the commercialization of the glucowatch system in north america and europe 
the purpose of such an alliance or alliances is for us to secure certain commercialization functions  such as distribution  sales and customer service 
we are in discussions with several companies regarding this objective 
some of the companies are international in scope and would provide the requisite commercialization functions worldwide 
other companies focus on certain geographies and or certain commercialization functions 
the potential signing of a worldwide commercialization agreement may or may not coincide with the launch of our glucowatch system  assuming we receive fda approval 
we are evaluating out sourced capabilities for a us launch without a worldwide commercialization alliance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a commercialization alliance or alliances or that we will be able to out source certain commercialization capabilities for launch without a worldwide commercialization alliance in place 
we cannot assure you that such third parties will not  for competitive reasons  support  directly or indirectly  a company or product that competes with one of our products 
furthermore  any dispute between us and such a third party might require us to initiate or defend against expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings 
if one of our partners  distributors or licensees terminates an arrangement  cannot fund or otherwise satisfy its obligations under its arrangements  or significantly disputes or breaches a contractual commitment  then we would likely be required to seek an alternative partner  distributor  or licensee 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to reach agreement with a replacement third party 
if we were unable to find a replacement third party  we might not be able to perform or fund the activities of the current partner  distributor or licensee 
even if we were able to perform and fund these activities  our capital requirements would increase substantially 
additionally  we may choose to self fund certain research and development projects in order to exploit our technologies 
if these activities result in a commercial product  they will help our long term operating results but will negatively affect our short term operating results 
furthermore  as discussed above  we have limited marketing  manufacturing  distribution and sales experience 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
the design  development  manufacture and use of our medical products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
producers of medical products may face substantial liability for damages in the event of product failure or allegations that the product caused harm 
we currently maintain product liability insurance  but it is expensive and difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to product liability claims  that our current insurance would cover any claims  or that adequate insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms in the future 
in the event we are held liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage  or if any claim or product recall creates significant adverse publicity  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to retain or hire key personnel 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth significantly depends upon retaining key scientific  technical  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified scientific  technical  managerial and financial personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel in these areas  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have anti takeover provisions 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions that may make the acquisition of control of cygnus more difficult or expensive 
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws  among other things i provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock entitled to vote for such directors  ii permit the remaining directors but not the stockholders  unless the directors so resolve to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board  iii eliminate the ability of stockholders to act by written consent and iv require the vote of stockholders holding at least of the outstanding shares of voting stock to amend  alter or repeal the bylaws and certain provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation  including the provisions described in i through iv 
such provisions may make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by the board of directors 
under the restated certificate of incorporation  the board of directors also has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of any such series without stockholder approval 
the board of directors could  therefore  issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of cygnus 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan which  under certain circumstances  would significantly dilute the equity interest of persons seeking to acquire control over us without the prior approval of the board of directors 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock substantially fluctuates in response to factors such as  but not limited to announcements by us or our competitors of results of regulatory approval filings or clinical trials or testing  developments or disputes governing proprietary rights  technological innovations or new commercial products  government regulatory action  and general conditions in the medical technology industry  changes in securities analysts recommendations  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have particularly affected the market prices of many medical technology companies  unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
fluctuations or decreases in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect the market for our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price for a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we do not pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
our current bank term loan precludes us from paying dividends to stockholders 
we currently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any dividends in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our million convertible debentures  our million equipment loans  and our million convertible promissory note related to the sanofi arbitration settlement  which all have fixed rates 
we also have no cash flow exposure due to the rate change for certain long term portions of our sanofi arbitration obligations  as such obligations are not interest bearing 
we do have cash flow exposure on our million bank term loan due to its variable interest rate prime plus 
we primarily enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
because we do not have any assets or liabilities in foreign currencies  we have no risk from exchange rate changes
