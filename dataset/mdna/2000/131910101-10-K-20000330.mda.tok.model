item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is engaged in the research  development and commercialization of products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
using innovative technologies  the company is addressing such key problems in cardiac diagnosis as the identification of those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest  the early detection of coronary artery disease  and the prompt and accurate diagnosis of heart attack 
clinical research conducted to date has demonstrated that the presence of t wave alternans in patients with known  suspected or at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia predicts increased risk of a cardiac event ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden death 
sudden cardiac death accounts for approximately one half of all cardiac related deaths  or about  in the united states each year 
results of operations the company s principal products are the ch alternans system and hi resolution sensors 
both products have received k clearance from the food and drug administration fda for sale in the united states 
internationally  the ch system has received the ce mark for sale in europe and has been approved for sale by the ministry of health in japan 
in april  the company was successful in obtaining clearance from the fda of its k submission for expansion of its labeling allowing for claims stating that the presence of t wave alternans in patients with known  suspected or at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia predicts increased risk of a cardiac event ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden death 
during september the company was able to address a major impediment to the widespread clinical use of its alternans test  when it introduced a new version of its alternans technology allowing the physician to use a treadmill to exercise patients during an alternans test 
prior to this innovation  exercise with a bicycle was the recommended method for testing patients for alternans 
most physicians in the us utilize a treadmill to exercise patients during a standard stress test 
in december  the first clinical t wave alternans test was reimbursed by a third party payor  blue shield of california and delta health systems 
the total test reimbursement was 
earlier in the year  the company had engaged peer review network  a provider of services to insurers to assist in the adjudication of claims for new technologies  to perform an independent review of the company s alternans technology and report its findings to its insurance company clients as well as a list of national subscribers 
the report  published in the october edition of prn newsletter  recommended reimbursement of the company s t wave alternans test by third party payors 
the availability of adequate reimbursement by insurers to physicians is critical to broad acceptance of the alternans test as a standard of care 
during the second quarter of  the company initiated a planned strategic transition away from its previous sales focus on standard stress systems to one primarily focused on potential customers interested in the clinical use of its alternans test and proprietary disposable sensors 
the result of this change in focus was a reduction in sales of standard stress systems in the us during the second half of fiscal when compared to the same period of fiscal during the same period  sales of alternans systems and disposable sensors in the us increased 
during fiscal the company raised gross proceeds totaling million million net of issuance costs from the sale of  shares of common stock in two separate private placement transactions 
in addition warrants for the purchase of  shares of common stock were issued 
as a result of this activity  the company ended fiscal with million of cash  equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet 
a third closing on million of common stock million net of issuance costs was completed in january a total of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued in this transaction 
all proceeds will be used to fund the company s operating costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  during the twelve month period ended december  fiscal and  during the twelve month period ended december  fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from the sale of capital equipment and other miscellaneous products was  and  for fiscal and fiscal respectively  a decline of 
revenue from the sale of disposable sensors was  and  for fiscal and fiscal respectively  an increase of due primarily to increase in unit sales in the united states 
revenue from the sale of the ch alternans system and the company s proprietary disposable sensors increased during fiscal while revenue from the sale of standard stress systems declined during the same period 
these results reflect the company s planned transition away from its previous sales focus on standard stress systems to one primarily focused on potential customers interested in the clinical use of its alternans test and proprietary disposable sensors 
us revenue from the sale of the ch alternans system and disposable sensors increased during fiscal while revenue from the sale of standard stress test systems declined 
international revenue from the sale of the ch alternans system and disposable sensors declined by during fiscal sales of alternans product to japan declined 
the company s japanese distributor fukuda denshi  ltd reduced their purchases during the year in an effort to reduce on hand inventories 
sales to all other international customers increased during fiscal sales of standard stress test systems increased  while revenue from the sale of the ch system with the alternans option and disposable sensors increased during the same period 
the company believes that its decision to change distribution partners in europe during fiscal has resulted in an improved focus and commitment to sale of the company s standard stress test and t wave alternans products 
gross profits declined to of total revenue in fiscal from for fiscal the decrease is due to the effect of the strong increase in the sale of product to the company s european distributors at industry standard distributor pricing  which is lower than commercial pricing  had a major effect on the gross profit percentage 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
fiscal included approximately  of costs associated with the company s patient multi center clinical study supporting the k filed with fda in august and cleared in april  for expansion of its labeling claims for t wave alternans 
these costs are partially offset by an increase in development costs associated with the company s new add on module scheduled for introduction in selling and marketing costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the growth in fiscal expenditures reflects spending on initiatives targeted at increased awareness of the company s proprietary t wave alternans technology and the clinical use of its alternans test  as well as  programs supporting obtaining reimbursement from third party payors for clinicians performing alternans tests administrative costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of reflecting increased cost in support of the company s expanded information systems infrastructure and employee education and training programs 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
the reduction primarily reflects the impact of lower interest rates during fiscal on the company s short term cash investments partially offset by increased cash and marketable securities balances from the private placement of common stock in june and october fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  in fiscal and  for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  an increase of 
sales of the company s ch system and accessories accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the remainder of the revenues were from the sale of the company s proprietary  disposable sensors 
revenues from products sold outside the united states were  in fiscal  an increase of  or over the previous fiscal year 
revenues from products sold to japan were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
revenues from products sold to the remaining international customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
at the end of fiscal  the company changed distribution partners in europe due to the former distribution partners failure to meet contract terms 
a new distributor was appointed  effective april  the company believes this transition accounted for the decline in revenues during fiscal sales to all international customers accounted for of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to us customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in us revenues results from improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the company s sales organization  which was expanded during the company employs direct sales managers in the us and had independent manufacturers sales representatives under contract at the end of fiscal cost of goods sold was  or of total revenues  in fiscal and  or of total revenues  in fiscal the improved ratio of costs to product sales during fiscal is the result of the company s product cost reduction programs targeted at reducing the cost of direct materials and the impact of increases in production volumes on the allocation of fixed overhead costs 
the continued increase in percentage of revenues from us customers  which have a higher margin  has favorably affected the overall cost of sales ratio 
the company anticipates that these factors together with increases in revenues of its hi resolution disposable sensors will continue to favorably effect the overall gross margin 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the company incurred incremental costs totaling  during fiscal to complete its clinical studies supporting the k filed with fda for expansion of its labeling claims for its t wave alternans technology 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in of  in the amount of compensation expense recorded relating to stock options granted to non employees for services rendered and an increase during fiscal over fiscal of  in the amount of software development costs capitalized under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily the result of the costs associated with compensation paid to us sales representatives associated with the increase in revenues during fiscal the company continues to increase its marketing efforts targeted at the rapid adoption of t wave alternans testing by clinical cardiologists and other medical professionals 
additionally  during fiscal  the company experienced several changes in management personnel 
as a result  the company recorded  of termination costs associated with these changes 
interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of the net reduction in the company s cash and marketable securities balances by  during fiscal inflation and income taxes inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for any of the years in the period ended december  the company has not recorded a provision for income taxes for the years    and because it incurred net losses in each of such years 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of  as well as  and  of federal and state tax credit carryforwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income and income tax liabilities  respectively 
these carryforwards generally expire in the years through and may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in the company s ownership 
there can be no assurance that changes in ownership in future periods or continuing losses will not significantly limit the company s use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company has generated taxable losses from operations since inception and  accordingly  has no taxable income available to offset the carryback of net operating losses 
in addition  although management s operating plans anticipate taxable income in future periods  such plans provide for taxable losses over the near term and make significant assumptions which cannot be reasonably assured including approval of the company s products by the fda and market acceptance of these products by customers 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance  at december  for its deferred tax assets since  in the opinion of management  realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured defined as a likelihood of slightly more than percent 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company raised gross proceeds of   net of issuance costs from the sale of common stock 
in addition  the company utilized  of a  line of credit secured by selected customer accounts receivable at the end of fiscal these financing activities offset cash used to fund the increased level of operations  with corresponding increases in most balance sheet accounts 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by  from december  to december   consistent with the company s net loss for fiscal net of total financing activities 
accounts receivable  net  increased slightly by  during the year  reflecting increased sales activity and the broadening of the company s customer base 
inventory levels have increased slightly from  to  during the year 
fixed asset additions during the year primarily represent increased sales demonstration  clinical research units and additional information systems infrastructure 
the proceeds of the equity offerings have been used primarily to fund operating losses of  reflecting expenditures to support research  new product development and clinical trials activities  to support a marketing and sales organization  and to support an administrative infrastructure and the investment of approximately  in property and equipment through december  as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  in january  the company raised and additional million net of issuance costs from the sale of  shares of common stock 
this amount is not included in the above amounts 
the company expects its capital expenditures to increase as it continues to commercialize its products  particularly in connection with the introduction of its add on module during fiscal the company does not expect capital expenditures to exceed an aggregate of  over the next two years 
under the terms of various license  consulting and technology agreements  the company is required to pay royalties on sales of its products 
minimum license maintenance fees under these license agreements  which are creditable against royalties otherwise payable for each year  range from  to  per year in total through the company is committed to pay an aggregate of  of such minimum license maintenance fees subsequent to december  as part of these agreements  the company is also committed to meet certain development and sales milestones  including a requirement to spend a minimum of  in any two year period for research and development  clinical trials  marketing  sales and or manufacturing of products related to certain technology covered by the consulting and technology agreements 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements through factors which may affect future results this annual report on form k the annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
in this section  we  us and our refer to cambridge heart  inc unless the context otherwise requires 
risks related to our operations we may never generate substantial revenues we are engaged primarily in the commercialization  manufacture  research and development of products for the non invasive diagnosis of heart disease 
we have incurred substantial and increasing net losses through december  we may never generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we develop additional products and fund clinical trials of our product candidates 
our research and development expenses may also increase in the future as we supplement our internal research and development with additional third party technology licenses and potential acquisition of complementary products and technologies 
we also expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in connection with the continued expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
revenues generated from the sale of our products will depend upon numerous factors  including 
the timing of regulatory actions  
progress of product development  
the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  
varying pricing promotions and volume discounts to customers  
competition  and 
the availability of third party reimbursement 
our technology may never achieve market acceptance we believe that our future success will depend  in large part  upon the successful commercialization and market acceptance of our t wave alternans technology 
market acceptance will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the diagnostic advantages and cost effectiveness of this technology and upon our ability to obtain third party reimbursement for users of our technology 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of our t wave alternans technology or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are superior to our technology 
the results of future clinical studies may not support the usefulness of our technology we have sponsored and are continuing to sponsor clinical studies relating to our t wave alternans technology and hi resolution sensors to establish the predictive value of such technology 
although studies on high risk patients to date have indicated that the measurement of t wave alternans to predict the vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia is comparable to electrophysiology testing  we do not know whether the results of such studies  particularly studies involving patients who are not high risk  will continue to be favorable 
any clinical studies or trials which fail to demonstrate that the measurement of t wave alternans is at least comparable in accuracy to alternative diagnostic tests  or which otherwise call into question the cost effectiveness  efficacy or safety of our technology  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty responding to changing technology the medical device market is characterized by rapidly advancing technology 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with advancing technology and competitive innovations 
however  we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products or alternative diagnostic techniques may be developed that will render our current or planned products obsolete or inferior 
rapid technological development by competitors may result in our products becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources competition from competitors medical devices that diagnose cardiac disease is intense and likely to increase 
we compete with manufacturers of electrocardiogram stress tests  the conventional method of diagnosing ischemic heart disease  as well as with manufacturers of other invasive and non invasive tests  including ep testing  electrocardiograms  holter monitors  ultrasound tests and systems of measuring cardiac late potentials 
many of our competitors and prospective competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  research and development experience and regulatory  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
many of these competitors offer broad  well established product lines and ancillary services not offered by cambridge heart 
some of our competitors have long term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to market entry 
we depend heavily on independent manufacturers representatives and foreign distributors we currently market our products in the united states through a small direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
we may not be able to continue to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct sales persons or independent manufacturers representatives 
we market our products internationally through independent distributors 
these distributors also distribute competing products under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant international distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business if a new distributor  sales representative or other suitable sales organization could not be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
to the extent that we rely on sales in certain territories through distributors  any revenues we receive in those territories will depend upon the efforts of our distributors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a distributor will market our products successfully or that the terms of any future distribution arrangements will be acceptable to us 
risks related to the market for cardiac diagnostic equipment our business could be subject to product liability claims the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices entails the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls 
although we maintain product liability insurance in the united states and in other countries in which we conduct business  including clinical trials and product marketing and sales  such coverage may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent commercialization of the ch alternans system or cause a significant financial burden on cambridge heart  or both  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and ability to market the ch alternans system as currently contemplated 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop patentable products  enforce our patents and obtain patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
however  the patent positions of medical device companies  including cambridge heart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can give no assurance that patents will issue from any patent applications we own or license or that  if patents do issue  the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  any issued patents we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted under issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  and we can give no assurance that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology  or disclose such technology or that we can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
others could claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights our commercial success will depend in part on our neither infringing patents issued to others nor breaching the licenses upon which our products might be based 
our licenses of patents and patent applications impose various commercialization  sublicensing  insurance  royalty and other obligations on our part 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  licenses could convert from being exclusive to nonexclusive in nature or could terminate 
we could become involved in litigation over intellectual property rights the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
litigation  which would likely result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
in particular  our competitors and other third parties hold issued patents and are assumed to hold pending patent applications which may result in claims of infringement against us or other patent litigation 
we also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  which could result in substantial cost  to determine the priority of inventions 
furthermore  we may have to participate at substantial cost in international trade commission proceedings to abate importation of products which would compete unfairly with our products 
we may not be able to protect our trade secrets we rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  advisors  vendors and consultants 
we can give no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any  breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on cambridge heart 
we may not be able to obtain third party reimbursement our revenues currently depend and will continue to depend  to a significant extent  on sales of the ch alternans system 
our ability to successfully commercialize the ch alternans system depends in part on the availability of  and our ability to obtain  adequate levels of third party reimbursement for use of the ch alternans system 
reimbursement is not currently available for the use of the ch alternans system for measuring t wave alternans 
the amount of reimbursement in the united states that will be available for clinical use of the ch alternans system  if any  is uncertain and may vary 
in the united states  the cost of medical care is funded  in substantial part  by government insurance programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and private and corporate health insurance plans 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
our ability to commercialize the ch alternans system successfully will depend  in large part  on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the use of the ch alternans system and associated sensors are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
we do not know whether reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for the ch alternans system  or if available  will not be decreased in the future or that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  the ch alternans system 
the unavailability of third party reimbursement or the inadequacy of the reimbursement for medical tests using the ch alternans system would have a material adverse effect on cambridge heart
