interest rate risk the company generally places its investments in ap rated commercial bonds and paper  municipal securities and certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year 
the company actively manages its portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities but in order to ensure liquidity will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
the company has not and does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect of the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on the company s future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources 
foreign currency risk the company operates on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues are billed and expenses incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling

as the currency rate changes  translation of the income statement of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company does not hedge translation risks because any cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested 
to date  the effect of foreign currency fluctuations are reflected in the company s operating results and have not been material 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating loss for international operations by less than  the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place in january to date  the introduction of the euro has had no impact on the company s operations in the uk  as all net revenues have been billed in pounds sterling
