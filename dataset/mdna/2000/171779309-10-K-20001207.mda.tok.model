overview ciena is a leader in the rapidly growing intelligent optical networking equipment market 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of products for communications service providers worldwide 
our customers include long distance carriers  competitive and incumbent local exchange carriers  internet service providers  wireless and wholesale carriers 
ciena offers optical transport and intelligent optical switching systems that enable service providers to provision  manage and deliver high bandwidth services to their customers 
we have pursued a strategy to develop and leverage the power of disruptive technologies to change the fundamental economics of building carrier class tele and data communications networks  thereby providing our customers with a competitive advantage 
ciena s intelligent optical networking products are designed to enable carriers to deliver any time  any size  any priority bandwidth to their customers 
ciena s lightworks is an optical networking architecture designed to change the fundamental economics of building service provider networks 
lightworks focuses on the three critical areas of optical networking long distance optical transport  short distance optical transport and intelligent core switching 
the products in ciena s lightworks combine the functionality of several current network elements into a single network element  thereby lowering the capital equipment requirements of a service provider and simplifying the network  in order to reduce a carrier s network operating costs 
the products of ciena s lightworks architecture can be sold together as a complete network solution or separately as best of breed solutions 
products include four generations of long distance optical transport systems multiwave  multiwave sentry  multiwave sentry  and multiwave corestream 
lightworks also includes ciena s short distance optical transport products multiwave firefly  multiwave metro  and multiwave metro one 
ciena s lightworks architecture also includes its multiwave coredirector family of optical core switching products 
the recently introduced multiwave coredirector is an intelligent optical core switch that allows carriers to deliver a full range of transport services  without costly sonet sdh synchronous optical networks synchronous digital hierarchy multiplexers and with more flexibility than wavelength only devices 
the first release of the multiwave coredirector became available during the third fiscal quarter ended july  in november  ciena announced it was pursuing enhancements to its multiwave corestream product that will enable the system to offer the optimal combination of longer reach transport functionality and channel count to further lower network costs for service providers 
using forward error correction fec  nonlinearity management  and dispersion mapping technologies  plus embedded system intelligence  multiwave corestream ultimately will be able to support optical spans of up to  kilometers without additional optical to electrical signal regeneration 
we expect to begin customer shipments of the longer reach features of this product in the first quarter of fiscal see risk factors 
during january  ciena announced the lightworks toolkit for optical services  a series of new optics  silicon and software based service enablers 
ciena s lightworks toolkit is designed to assist carriers with the transition from static service provisioning to real time  on demand bandwidth delivery  from bandwidths limited by traditional sonet sdh to optical bandwidth of any size  and from a single wavelength quality of service to a range of service qualities that can be dynamically configured and monitored 
these service enabling tools began to be integrated into ciena s lightworks products during the second half of calendar see risk factors 
during may  ciena announced the introduction of its newest intelligent optical core switching product  multiwave coredirector ci  an entry version of ciena s market leading multiwave coredirector switch 
multiwave coredirector ci is designed to offer network operators all the intelligence  real time provisioning  dynamic network protection  and comprehensive network management capabilities of multiwave coredirector  but optimized for smaller central offices predominant in regional and metropolitan portions of service provider networks 
the initial release of multiwave coredirector ci is expected in limited availability for customer trials during the first quarter of calendar see risk factors 
during may  ciena also announced the launch of its lightworks on center tm management suite  a new fully integrated family of software based tools for comprehensive element  network and service layer management across service provider networks 
on center is designed to enable accelerated deployment of new  differentiating optical services  reduced network operating and management costs  and innovative customer service solutions 
the on center management suite is designed to help service providers use the built in networking intelligence of ciena s lightworks toolkit for optical services and network architecture to enable real time service deployment  dynamic service level agreement sla management  multi vendor optical service monitoring  full fault  configuration  accounting  performance and security fcaps management across ciena systems  and web based customer service awareness tools 
the initial release of on center became available during october during august  ciena announced that it had added rate adaptive gigabit ethernet technology to the lightworks toolkit for optical services 
ciena s rate adaptive gigabit ethernet technology uses software and asics to enable service providers to sell any size gigabit ethernet services in increments of mbps sts  up to gbps 
the service rate is adaptive to end users needs  allowing service providers to tailor pricing to a finer granularity of data rates 
additionally  the technology enables providers to transport fractional gigabit ethernet traffic from up to different customers over a single gps wavelength 
as a result  service providers can create a wide range of customized optical service options for end users and deliver those services over more efficient access and core networks that leverage the economies of gigabit ethernet transmission 
rate adaptive gigabit ethernet technology is expected to be available for customer trails on ciena s multiwave metro systems in the first half of calendar ciena has increased the number of revenue generating optical networking equipment customers from a total of twenty seven customers during fiscal to thirty two customers for fiscal we intend to preserve and enhance our market leadership and eventually build on our installed base with new and additional products 
ciena believes that its product and service quality  manufacturing experience  and proven track record of delivery will enable it to endure competitive pricing pressure while concentrating on efforts to reduce product costs and maximize production efficiencies 
see risk factors 
as of october   the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was an increase of persons over the approximate  employed on october  results of operations fiscal years ended  and revenue 
the company recognized million  million and million in revenue for the fiscal years ended october   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in product shipments across all product lines 
the approximate million or decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was largely the result of reduced selling prices 
ciena recognized revenues from a total of thirty two  twenty seven  and fourteen optical equipment customers during fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  sprint  qwest communications and gts network ltd 
each accounted for at least or more of ciena s revenue and all three combined accounted for of the company s fiscal revenue 
during fiscal year sprint  worldcom  and gts network ltd  each accounted for at least or more of ciena s revenue and all three combined accounted for of ciena s fiscal revenue 
this compares to fiscal in which sprint was the only customer and in total accounted for of ciena s fiscal revenue 
revenue derived from foreign sales accounted for approximately   and of the company s total revenues during fiscal   and  respectively 
for fiscal  ciena s optical network equipment revenues were derived from sales of the multiwave sentry  multiwave corestream configured for both gigabits per second gbps and gbps transmission rates  multiwave sentry  multiwave metro  multiwave  multiwave coredirector  multiwave firefly systems and multiwave metroone 
during fiscal  the company recognized revenues from sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave sentry  multiwave  multiwave metro  multiwave firefly  and multiwave corestream systems 
during fiscal  the company recognized revenues from sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave  multiwave firefly  and multiwave sentry systems 
the revenues for fiscal improved as compared to fiscal due to increased sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave corestream  multiwave sentry  multiwave metro  and multiwave firefly systems  and also from the introduction of revenues from multiwave coredirector and multiwave metroone systems 
the amount of revenue recognized from multiwave sentry and multiwave declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline in multiwave sentry sales in fiscal was offset by the introduction of new revenues from the multiwave corestream  and multiwave metro products in fiscal fiscal revenues from multiwave sentry and multiwave firefly were comparable to the revenues recognized for these products in fiscal revenues derived from engineering  furnishing and installation services as a percentage of total revenue were   and for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing and engineering  furnishing and installation operations 
gross profit was million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
gross margin was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to lower component costs and improved production efficiencies 
the decrease in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal was largely attributable to lower selling prices 
ciena s gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including product mix  continued competitive market pricing  outsourcing of manufacturing  manufacturing volumes and efficiencies  competition for skilled labor  and fluctuations in component costs 
downward pressures on our gross margins may be further impacted by an increased percentage of revenues from ef i services or additional service requirements 
ciena will continue to concentrate on efforts to reduce product costs and maximize production efficiencies and  if successful in these efforts  may be able to improve gross margins in the future 
see risk factors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in research and development expenses related to increased staffing levels  purchases of materials used in development of new or enhanced product prototypes  and outside consulting services in support of certain developments and design efforts 
during fiscal   and research and development expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
ciena expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal to support the continued development of ciena s intelligent optical networking products  the exploration of new or complementary technologies  and the pursuit of various cost reduction strategies 
ciena has expensed research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in selling and marketing expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels in the areas of sales  technical assistance and field support  and increases in commissions earned  trade show participation and promotional costs 
during fiscal   and selling and marketing expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company anticipates that its selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as additional personnel are hired and additional offices are opened to allow the company to pursue new customers and market opportunities 
the company also expects the portion of selling and marketing expenses attributable to technical assistance and field support  specifically in europe  latin america  and asia  will increase as the company s installed base of operational multiwave systems increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal year to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal year to in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels and outside consulting services 
during fiscal   and general and administrative expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as a result of the expansion of the company s administrative staff required to support its expanding operations 
settlement of accrued contract obligation 
the million gain from settlement of accrued contract obligation relates to the july termination of certain accrued contract obligations that ciena received from iaxis limited  one of ciena s european customers 
in september  ciena was informed that an administrative order had been issued by a london court against iaxis limited 
as a result of this order  joint administrators were appointed to manage the business of iaxis limited while they marketed the business for sale and formulated a reorganization of the company 
see provision for doubtful accounts below 
purchased research and development 
purchased research and development costs were million for the fiscal year these costs were for the purchase of technology and related assets associated with the acquisition of terabit during the second quarter of fiscal pirelli litigation 
the pirelli litigation costs of million in fiscal were attributable to a million payment made to pirelli during the third quarter of and to additional other legal and related costs incurred in connection with the settlement of this litigation 
merger related costs 
the merger costs for fiscal of approximately million were costs related to ciena s acquisition of omnia and lightera 
these costs include an million non cash charge for the acceleration of warrants based upon ciena s common stock price on june  and million for fees  legal and accounting services and other costs 
the warrants were issued to one of omnia s potential customers and became exercisable upon the consummation of the merger between ciena and omnia 
the merger related costs for fiscal were costs related to the contemplated merger between ciena and tellabs 
these costs include approximately million in securities and exchange commission filing fees and approximately million in legal  accounting  and other related expenses 
provision for doubtful accounts 
ciena performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral from its customers 
ciena maintains an allowance for potential losses when identified 
ciena s allowance for doubtful accounts as of october  was million 
approximately million relates to provisions made for doubtful accounts associated with iaxis limited  one of ciena s european customers 
in september  ciena was informed that an administrative order had been issued by a london court against iaxis limited 
as a result of this order  joint administrators were appointed to manage the business of iaxis limited while they marketed the business for sale and formulated a reorganization of the company 
in november  ciena was notified that dynegy inc and its subsidiaries had entered into a proposed agreement to acquire the assets and stock of iaxis limited from the administrators 
as a consequence of the terms of a the proposed agreement between the administrators of iaxis limited  dynegy and its subsidiaries  and of b a related sales agreement between ciena and dynegy  ciena expects to realize approximately million of the gross outstanding accounts receivable balance due from iaxis limited as of october  while the proposed purchase agreement between the administrators of iaxis limited and dynegy is subject to certain administrative and judicial approvals  ciena believes that such approvals will be ultimately obtained and that ciena will be successful in collecting the net million outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer 
however  should such approvals not occur  additional write offs might be required 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  net of interest expense associated with the company s debt obligations 
other income expense  net  was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in other income expense from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in companies other income expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of the investment of the net proceeds of the company s stock offerings and net earnings 
provision benefit for income taxes 
ciena s provision benefit for income taxes was   and of pre tax earnings loss for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax provision for was lower than the expected primarily due to benefits from research and development tax credits 
the benefit for fiscal was less than the expected statutory benefit of due to non deductible merger costs 
the income tax provision for was higher than the expected statutory rate of  due primarily to charges for purchased research and development and state tax charges related to the alta acquisition 
purchased research and development charges are not deductible for tax purposes 
exclusive of the effect of these charges  the company s provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in fiscal as of october  ciena s deferred tax asset was million 
the realization of this asset could be adversely affected if future earnings are lower than anticipated

net income loss all share and per share information has been retroactively restated to reflect the two for one stock split effective september  ciena s quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to vary in the future 
the company s detailed discussion of risk factors addresses the many factors that have caused such variation in the past  and may cause similar variations in the future 
see risk factors 
ciena s revenues have increased in each of the last eight quarters due to strong demand across existing products and introduction of new products such as multiwave corestream configured for both gb s and gb s transmission rates 
ciena s gross margin percentage has improved from the first quarter fiscal to the fourth quarter fiscal as a result of component cost reductions  production efficiencies  and relative stable sales pricing 
ciena s operating expenses have increased in each of the last eight quarters due to continued investments in research and development  selling and marketing  and infrastructure activities 
exclusive of provisions for doubtful accounts and merger related costs  the company s operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have generally decreased each of the last eight quarters 
during fiscal  ciena s operating expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as percentage of revenue 
we expect to preserve and enhance our market leadership and build on our installed base with new and additional products in conjunction with increased investments in selling  marketing  and customer service activities 
see risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources at october   ciena s principal source of liquidity was its cash and cash equivalents 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in corporate debt securities and us government obligations 
the company s corporate debt securities and us government obligations have contractual maturities of six months or less 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net gain adjusted for the non cash charges of depreciation  amortization  tax benefit related to exercise of stock options  provisions for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  and warranty  increases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
included in investment activities were additions to capital equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal   and of million  million  and million  respectively 
the capital equipment expenditures were primarily for test  manufacturing and computer equipment 
the company expects additional combined capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures of approximately million to be made during fiscal to support selling and marketing  manufacturing and product development activities and the construction of leasehold improvements for its facilities 
we generated million  million  and million in cash from financing activities in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  ciena received million from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
during fiscal ciena received million from the exercise of stock options  the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan  and from the additional capitalization of omnia and lightera 
during fiscal  ciena received approximately million from the issuance of stock associated with the capitalization of omnia and lightera  and from the exercise of stock options 
we believe that our existing cash balances and investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements at least through the end of fiscal however  possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies may require additional financing prior to such time 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available when required or  if available  can be secured on terms satisfactory to us 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date for sfas no 
 will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending october  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab which clarifies the securities and exchange commission s view on revenue recognition 
subsequently  the sec released sab b  which delayed the implementation date of sab for registrants with fiscal years that begin between december  and march  ciena is required to be in conformity with the provisions of sab  as amended  no later than january   with the impact of such adoption being treated on a cumulative basis as of november  while management will continue to assess sab  ciena presently believes its existing revenue recognition policies and procedures are generally in compliance with sab and  therefore  sab s adoption will have no material impact on ciena s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus that the income tax benefit realized by a company upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option or the disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option should be classified in the operating section of the statement of cash flows 
the consensus is effective for the company s quarters ending after july  all comparative cash flow statements as presented have been restated to comply with this consensus 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers occurring after march  and for disclosures relating to the securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  including the reports we incorporate by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our results can be unpredictable our ability to recognize revenue during a quarter from a customer depends upon our ability to ship product and satisfy other contractual obligations of a customer sale in that quarter 
in general  revenue and operating results in any reporting period may fluctuate due to factors including loss of a customer  the timing and size of orders from customers  changes in customers requirements  including changes to orders from customers  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria and related revenue recognition issues  manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals  increased service  warranty or repair costs  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employee gains on stock options exercised  and changes in general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications and intelligent optical networking industries 
our intelligent optical networking products require a relatively large investment and our target customers are highly demanding and technically sophisticated 
there are only a limited number of potential customers in each geographic market and each customer has unique needs 
as a result  the sales cycles for our products are long  often more than a year between our initial contact with the customer and their commitment to purchase 
we budget expense levels on our expectations of long term future revenue 
these budgets reflect our substantial investment in the financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources we think we may need for large potential customers  even though we do not know the volume  duration or timing of any purchases from them 
in addition  we make a substantial investment in financial  manufacturing and engineering resources for the development of new and enhanced products 
as a result  we may continue to experience high inventory levels  operating expenses and general overhead 
we have experienced rapid expansion in all areas of our operations  particularly in the manufacturing of our products 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to continue to expand our manufacturing facilities in a timely manner so that we can satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers 
our failure to expand these facilities in a timely manner and meet our customer delivery commitments would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our product development efforts will require us to incur ongoing development and operating expenses and any delay in the contributions from new products  such as the multiwave coredirector product line and enhancements to our existing optical transport products  could harm our business 
changes in technology or the delays in the deployment of new products could hurt our near term prospects the market for optical networking equipment is changing at a rapid pace 
the accelerated pace of deregulation and the adoption of new technology in the telecommunications industry likely will intensify the competition for improved optical networking products 
our ability to develop  introduce and manufacture new and enhanced products will depend upon our ability to anticipate changes in technology  industry standards and customer requirements 
our failure to introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner could harm our competitive position and financial condition 
several of our new products  including the multiwave coredirector and the enhancements to the multiwave corestream products  are based on complex technology which could result in unanticipated delays in the development  manufacture or deployment of these products 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue from these products could be adversely affected by the extensive testing required for these products by our customers 
the complexity of technology associated with support equipment for these products could also result in unanticipated delays in their deployment 
these delays could harm our competitive and financial condition 
competition from competitive products  the introduction of new products embodying new technologies  a change in the requirements of our customers  or the emergence of new industry standards could delay or hinder the purchase and deployment of our products and could render our existing products obsolete  unmarketable or uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint 
the long certification process for new telecommunications equipment used in the networks of the regional bell operating companies  referred to as rbocs  has in the past resulted in and may continue to result in unanticipated delays which may affect the deployment of our products for the rboc market 
we face intense competition which could hurt our sales and profitability the market for optical networking equipment is extremely competitive 
competition in the optical networking installation and test services market is based on varying combinations of price  functionality  software functionality  manufacturing capability  installation  services  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements 
a small number of very large companies  including alcatel  cisco systems  fujitsu group  hitachi  lucent technologies  nec corporation  nortel networks  siemens ag and telefon ab lm ericsson  have historically dominated the telecommunications equipment industry 
these companies have substantial financial  marketing  manufacturing and intellectual property resources 
in addition  these companies have substantially greater resources to develop or acquire new technologies than we do and often have existing relationships with our potential customers 
we sell systems that compete directly with product offerings of these companies and in some cases displace or replace equipment they have traditionally supplied for telecommunications networks 
as such  we represent a specific threat to these companies 
the continued expansion of our product offerings with the multiwave coredirector product line and enhancements to our multiwave corestream product line likely will increase this perceived threat 
we expect continued aggressive tactics from many of these competitors  including price discounting  early announcements of competing products and other marketing efforts  one stop shopping appeals  customer financing assistance  marketing and advertising assistance  and intellectual property disputes 
these tactics can be particularly effective in a highly concentrated customer base such as ours 
our customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in pricing for optical networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions  which may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts in their optical networking products across a larger array of products and services and across a larger customer base than ours 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in the average sales price for our products by a reduction in the cost of our products  our gross profit margins will be adversely affected 
our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margins would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our customers have indicated that they intend to establish a relationship with at least two vendors for optical networking products 
with respect to customers for whom we are the only supplier  we do not know when or if these customers will select a second vendor or what impact the selection might have on purchases from us 
if a second optical networking supplier is chosen  these customers could reduce their purchases from us  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us 
new competitors are emerging to compete with our existing products as well as our future products 
there has been an increase in funding for new companies focused on the development of new products for the optical networking market 
we expect new competitors to continue to emerge as the optical networking market continues to expand 
these companies may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly due to the narrow and exclusive focus of their efforts 
several of these competitors have raised significantly more cash and they have in some cases offered stock in their companies  positions on technical advisory boards  or have provided significant vendor financing to attract new customers 
in particular  a number of companies  including several start up companies and recently public companies that have raised substantial equity capital  have announced products that compete with our multiwave corestream  multiwave metro  and multiwave coredirector products 
our inability to compete successfully against these companies would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully complete development and achieve commercial acceptance of new products during the third quarter of fiscal  the first version of our multiwave coredirector became available 
our multiwave coredirector ci product and enhancements to the multiwave coredirector and multiwave corestream product lines are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
we expect to offer additional releases of the multiwave coredirector product over the life of the product and continue to enhance features of our multiwave corestream product  including the longer reach and higher channel count functionality of our product line 
the initial release of multiwave coredirector ci is expected in limited availability for customer trials during the first quarter of calendar the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  including application specific integrated circuits  referred to as asics  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of embedded software validation  establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements  and identification and qualification of component suppliers 
each of these steps in turn presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the product 
specialized asics and intensive software testing and validation  in particular  are key to the timely introduction of enhancements to the multiwave coredirector product line  and schedule delays are common in the final validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce these products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
the markets for our multiwave coredirector product line are relatively new 
we have not established commercial acceptance of these products  and we cannot assure you that the substantial sales and marketing efforts necessary to achieve commercial acceptance in traditionally long sales cycles will be successful 
if the markets for these products do not develop or the products are not accepted by the market  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and for some items we do not have a substitute supplier we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our products include several higher performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
furthermore  certain key optical and electronic components we use in our optical transport systems are currently available only from sole sources  and in some cases  that sole source is also a competitor 
a worldwide shortage of some electrical components has caused an increase in the price of components 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
these delays could harm our customer relationships 
failures of components can affect customer confidence in our products and could adversely affect our financial performance and the reliability and performance of our products 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components and have received components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could harm our business 
a recent wave of consolidation among suppliers of these components  such as the recent purchases of e tek and sdl by jds uniphase  could adversely impact the availability of components on which we depend 
delayed deliveries of key components from these sources could adversely effect our business 
any delays in component availability for any of our products or test equipment could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue from them 
these delays could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
we rely on contract manufacturers for our products we rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our coredirector product line and some of the components for our other products 
the qualification of these manufacturers is an expensive and time consuming process and these contract manufacturers build modules for other companies  including for our competitors 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with each of these manufacturers 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our manufacturers and we cannot be certain that they will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
if we cannot effectively manage these manufacturers or they fail to deliver components in a timely manner it may have an adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
some of our suppliers are also our competitors some of our component suppliers are both primary sources for components and major competitors in the market for system equipment 
for example  we buy components from alcatel  lucent technologies  nec corporation  nortel networks  and siemens ag 
each of these companies offers optical communications systems and equipment  which are competitive with our products 
also  lucent is the sole source of two components and is one of two suppliers of two others 
recently  lucent has announced that it intends to spin off a portion of its components business 
our supply of components from lucent may be adversely effected by this restructuring 
alcatel and nortel are suppliers of lasers used in our products and nec is a supplier of an important piece of testing equipment 
a decline in reliability or other adverse change in these supply relationships could harm our business 
sales to emerging carriers may increase the unpredictability of our results as we continue to address emerging carriers  timing and volume of purchasing from these carriers can also be more unpredictable due to factors such as their need to build a customer base  acquire rights of way and interconnections necessary to sell network service  and build out new capacity  all while working within their capital budget constraints 
sales to these carriers may increase the unpredictability of our financial results because even these emerging carriers purchase our products in multi million dollar increments 
unanticipated changes in customer purchasing plans also create unpredictability in our results 
a portion of our anticipated revenue over the next several quarters is comprised of orders of less than million each from several customers  some of which may involve extended payment terms or other financing assistance 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales to emerging carriers will depend on the relative financial condition of the specific customer  among other factors 
further  we will need to evaluate the collectibility of receivables from these customers if their financial conditions deteriorate in the future 
purchasing delays and changes in the financial condition or the amount of purchases by any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in the past we have had to make provisions for the accounts receivables from customers that experienced financial difficulty 
if additional customers face similar financial difficulties  our receivables from these customers may become uncollectible  we would have to write off the asset or decrease the value of the asset to the extent the receivable could not be collected 
these write downs or write offs would adversely affect our financial performance 
our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on intellectual property rights of others we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into non disclosure and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and consultants  and license agreements with our corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our products  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute regarding the use of our technology and may become involved with additional disputes in the future 
such lawsuits can be costly and may significantly divert time and attention from some members of our personnel 
we have received and may receive in the future  notices from holders of patents in the optical technology field that raise issues of possible infringement by our products 
questions of infringement in the optical networking equipment market often involve highly technical and subjective analysis 
there can be no assurance that any of these patent holders or others will not in the future initiate legal proceedings against us  or that we will be successful in defending against these actions 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute regarding the possible infringement of our products 
in the past  we have been forced to take a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  or to redesign or stop selling the product that includes the challenged intellectual property 
if we are sued for infringement and are unsuccessful in defending the suit  we could be subject to significant damages and our business and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
product performance problems could limit our sales prospects the production of new optical networking products and systems with high technology content involves occasional problems as the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking our manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we can not promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could harm our business 
our prospects depend on demand which we cannot reliably predict or control we may not anticipate changes in direction or magnitude of demand for our products 
the product offerings of our competitors could adversely affect the demand for our products 
in addition  unanticipated reductions in demand for our products could adversely affect us 
our products enable long distance optical transport  metropolitan optical transport  intelligent core switching and network management 
demand for our product depends on our customers requirements 
these requirements may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as the type and quantity of optical equipment needed by our customers  the timing of the deployment of optical equipment by our customers  the rate at which our current customers fund their network build outs  and the equipment configurations and network architectures our customers want 
customer determinations are subject to abrupt changes in response to their own competitive pressures  capital requirements and financial performance expectations 
these changes could harm our business 
recently we have experienced an increased level of sales activity that could lead to an upsurge in demand that is reflected in the overall increase in demand for optical networking and similar products in the telecommunications industry 
our results may suffer if we are unable to address this demand adequately by successfully scaling up our manufacturing capacity and hiring additional qualified personnel 
to date we have largely depended on our own manufacturing and assembly facilities to meet customer expectations  but we cannot be sure that we can satisfy our customers expectations in all cases by internal capabilities 
in that case  we face the challenge of adequately managing customer expectations and finding alternative means of meeting them 
if we fail to manage these expectations we could lose customers or receive smaller orders from customers 
our success largely depends on our ability to retain key personnel our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  particularly those skilled and experienced with optical communications equipment 
our key founders and employees  together with the key founders and employees of acquired companies have received a substantial number of our shares and vested options that can be sold at substantial gains 
in many cases  these individuals could become financially independent through these sales  before our future products have matured into commercially deliverable products 
these circumstances may make it difficult to retain and motivate these key personnel 
as we have grown and matured  competitors efforts to hire our employees have intensified  particularly among competitive start up companies and other early stage companies 
we have agreements in place with most of our employees that limit their ability to work for a competitor and prohibit them from soliciting our other employees and our customers following termination of their employment 
our employees and our competitors may not respect these agreements 
we have in the past been required to enforce  and are currently in the process of enforcing  some of these agreements 
we expect in the future to continue to be required to resort to legal actions to enforce these agreements and could incur substantial costs in doing so 
we may not be successful in these legal actions  and we may not be able to retain all of our key employees or attract new personnel to add to or replace them 
the loss of key personnel would likely harm our business 
part of our strategy involves pursuing strategic acquisitions that may not be successful as part of our strategy for growth  we will consider acquiring businesses that are intended to accelerate our product and service development processes and add complementary products and services 
we may issue equity or incur debt to finance these acquisitions 
acquisitions involve a number of operational risks  including risks that the acquired business will not be successfully integrated  may distract management attention and may involve unforeseen costs and liabilities 
our stock price may exhibit volatility our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of the activities of short sellers and risk arbitrageurs  and may have little relationship to our financial results or prospects 
volatility can also result from any divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements that we  our competitors  or our customers may make 
divergence between our actual results and our anticipated results  analyst estimates and public announcements by us  our competitors  or by customers will likely occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of our overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
as long as we continue to depend on a limited customer base  and particularly when a substantial majority of their purchases consist of newly introduced products like the multiwave corestream  multiwave coredirector and multiwave metro  there is substantial risk that our quarterly results will vary widely 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency discount notes with an average maturity of less than six months 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union began during the company s fiscal year the foreign currency exposure resulting from the introduction of the euro has been immaterial to the operating results of the company 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies was not material 
therefore an increase or decrease of percent in the foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on the company s financial position
