additionally  the impact of the problem extends to non it systems  such as automated plant systems and instrumentation 
the year issues could potentially result in major failures or misclassifications

even though not all of the responses to these inquiries have been received  the company item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued performed a risk assessment for all of the suppliers 
due to the nature of the company s operations and numerous suppliers  the company does not believe that any significant disruptions will occur in its operations 
however  contingency plans have been developed to address issues related to the company s third party suppliers not being year compliant 
year interruptions on customers operations could potentially result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels and reduction in cash flows

forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management of the company may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued changes in general economic conditions 
the company s customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard for their own containment and shipping purposes 
because the company supplies a cross section of industries  such as chemicals  food products  petroleum products  pharmaceuticals and metal products  demand for the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard and related corrugated products has historically corresponded to changes in general economic conditions of the united states  canada and mexico 
accordingly  the company s financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions existing in the united states  canada and mexico 
competition 
the company s business of manufacturing and selling industrial shipping containers and containerboard is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are price  quality and service 
many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources 
excess capacity in containerboard segment 
industry demand for containerboard products has declined in recent years causing excess capacity in this segment of the company s business 
these excess capacity levels and competitive pricing pressures in the containerboard market have negatively impacted the company s financial performance in recent years 
raw material shortages 
the company s raw materials are principally pulpwood  waste paper for recycling  paper  steel and resins 
some of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
shortages in raw materials could adversely affect the company s operations 
environmental and health and safety matters  product liability claims 
the company must comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding federal  state and local environmental matters  such as air and water quality and waste disposal 
the company must also comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding safety and health matters 
the failure to materially comply with such rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s operations 
furthermore  litigation or claims against the company with respect to such matters could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company may also become subject to product liability claims which could adversely affect the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded risks associated with acquisitions 
during the past several years the company has invested  and for the foreseeable future the company anticipates investing  a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the failure to retain key employees and contracts and the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption 
in addition  other companies in the company  s industries have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the company s operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect the company s financial performance 
timber and timberland sales 
the company has a significant inventory of standing timber and timberlands 
the frequency and volume of sales of timber and timberland will have an effect on the company s financial performance

c the average receive rate is based upon the libor rate at october  the rates presented are not intended to project the company s expectations for the future 
foreign currency risk the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on its financial instruments is not material because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the net sales and total assets of the company which are denominated in foreign currencies ie  canadian dollars and mexican pesos represent less than of the consolidated net sales and total assets 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risks
