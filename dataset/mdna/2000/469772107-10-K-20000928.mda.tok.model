item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the registrant  in the normal course of doing business  is theoretically exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to its securities available for sale and its line of credit 
as borrowing patterns are seasonal  the registrant is not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
therefore  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the line of credit is at the prime rate or lower may  during peak borrowing  have a negative impact on short term results  but would unlikely impact longer term results since a cost pass through would offset such higher interest expense 
all of the registrant s securities available for sale are state government or municipal bonds 
as of june   the cost and market value of such bonds was  and  respectively 
a significant increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the bond prices 
however  to minimize risk  the registrant has a policy of investing only in high rated instruments substantially all have aa or better moody s bond ratings and generally uses short term maturities currently the average life is about three years 
in addition  the proceeds from such securities are not essential to the working capital needs of the business and therefore could be held to maturity for full face value
