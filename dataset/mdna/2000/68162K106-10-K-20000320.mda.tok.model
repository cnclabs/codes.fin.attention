item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  and work stoppages by automotive manufacturers 
olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross margin 
accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its detroit lafayette and georgia operations 
toll processing generally results in lower selling prices and gross margin dollars per ton but higher gross margin percentages than the company s direct sales 
the company s results include the results of the jnt machining operation  the net assets of which were acquired june  in september  the jnt operation was relocated  and is now operating from a newly constructed  square foot plate processing and machining facility in chambersburg  pennsylvania 
the accompanying financial statements also include the results of the company s operation in georgia southeastern  the net assets of which were acquired effective june  the company s two joint ventures include olympic laser processing olp  a company formed in april to process laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive industry  and trumark steel processing tsp  a company formed in december  to support the flat rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry as a minority business enterprise mbe 
the company s interest in olp and interest in tsp are accounted for under the equity method 
the company guarantees portions of outstanding debt under both of the joint venture companies bank credit facilities 
as of december   olympic guaranteed of olp s million and of tsp s million of outstanding debt on a several basis 
olp constructed a new facility and has initially equipped it with two automated laser welding lines 
the venture plans to purchase and install two additional manual laser weld lines during the company expects olp start up costs to continue until the second half of  when all four welding lines are anticipated to be operating at full capacity 
tsp obtained certification as an mbe from the michigan minority business development council in december  and has been operating profitably in the second half of start up costs for olp and tsp have been expensed as incurred 
in december  the company wrote off its entire million joint venture investment in olympic continental resources ocr  a company formed in january to buy  sell and trade ferrous and non ferrous metals and alternate iron products to steel mills and scrap processors 
effective april   atlas iron processors  inc atlas ownership interest in the ocr joint venture ceased  and all ocr business transactions with atlas also ceased 
during the third quarter of  olympic announced the dissolution of ocr 
olympic  as guarantor of ocr s bank debt  made a payment to extinguish all million of ocr outstanding bank debt  and simultaneously assumed all remaining ocr receivables  inventory  and accounts payable  which are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
financing costs include interest expense on debt and costs associated with the company s accounts receivable securitization program financing costs 
interest rates paid by the company under its credit agreement are generally based on prime or libor plus a premium the premium determined quarterly  which varies based on the company s operating performance and financial leverage 
receivable securitization costs are based on commercial paper rates calculated on the amount of receivables sold 
the company sells certain products internationally  primarily in mexico and puerto rico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
these sales historically involve the company s direct representation of steel producers and may be covered by letters of credit or trade receivable insurance 
typically  international sales are more transactional in nature with lower gross margins than domestic sales 
domestic steel producers generally supply domestic customers before meeting foreign demand  particularly during periods of supply constraints 
page of because the company conducts its operations generally on the basis of short term orders  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance

the company anticipates demand from agricultural related customers to remain weak for the foreseeable future 
the decrease in tolling tons was attributable to the company s georgia operation  which increased its proportion of direct sales in net sales decreased by million  or  to million from million in average selling prices declined due to continued decreased market prices for steel  resulting from the significant penetration of imported steel in the company expects average selling prices to increase in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased to in from in the increase is a result of selling a larger proportion of processed  higher value added steel  and elimination of certain lower margin automotive sales

the lafayette charge was taken in accordance with accounting regulations which require long lived assets such as goodwill and fixed assets to be written down to fair market value when circumstances indicate that their carrying values are impaired 
the changed dynamics in the automotive marketplace  including gm s introduction of new processing capabilities at its regional distribution center  adversely impacted lafayette s cash flows and operating earnings 
these dynamics not only resulted in a loss of sales volume to gm but also left a portion of lafayette s processing page of equipment non productive and thereby non competitive in the automotive marketplace 
the company disposed of four pieces of processing equipment in the third quarter of  and developed a plan to dispose of the remaining non competitive equipment 
the remaining three pieces of non competitive equipment were disposed in accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million to write down certain processing equipment and other fixed assets  and million to write off all goodwill at lafayette

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirement is to fund its growth  including acquisitions and joint ventures  the purchase and upgrading of processing equipment and services  the construction and upgrading of related facilities  and additional working capital requirements 
the company uses cash generated from operations  long term debt obligations  equity offerings  and leasing transactions to fund these requirements 
historically  the company has used revolving credit borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from its receivable securitization program to finance its working capital requirements 
net cash from operating activities primarily represents net income plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and net start up costs from joint ventures  as well as changes in working capital 
during  million of net cash was provided from operating activities  consisting of million of cash generated from net income and non cash charges  offset by million of cash used for working capital purposes

net cash used for investing activities in totaled million  including million of payments for the new million plate processing and machining facility constructed in chambersburg  pennsylvania 
other significant spending included million for new laser processing equipment in minnesota and million for computer information technology

the slitter is expected to be installed and operational during the second half of the company s capital spending plan approximates million  including the new slitter 
cash flows from financing activities totaled million  and primarily consisted of million of net borrowings under its credit agreement  offset by million used to repurchase shares of olympic common stock 
in april  the company s board of directors authorized a one year program to purchase up to million shares of olympic common stock stock purchase 
the cost of purchasing such shares has been funded from the company s revolving credit facility 
also in april  the company entered into a million  fixed rate tax exempt industrial development bond financing agreement idb to finance the chambersburg project 
quarterly idb repayments commenced october  the company s bank credit agreement was amended in january the credit facility 
the amendment changed future interest coverage requirements  and added a basis point pricing tier to the premium schedule 
the credit facility also includes letter of credit commitments  which totaled approximately million at december   and contains restrictive covenants which require minimum net worth levels  maintenance of certain financial ratios and limitations on capital expenditures 
the company is in compliance with all covenants contained in the amended credit facility agreement 
as of december   approximately million was available under the company s revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities 
the company believes that funds available under the credit and securitization facilities  other credit and financing agreements and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity necessary to fund its anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements over the next months 
capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
in connection with its internal and external expansion strategies  the company may from time to time seek additional funds to finance other new facilities and equipment  acquisitions and significant improvements to processing equipment to respond to customers demands 
year compliance all of the company s business application software systems were yk year compliant by the third quarter of  and all other systems and equipment was compliant prior to december  the company has not experienced any disruptions related to yk 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of personnel  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  and borrowings under the various credit agreements 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operating income over the periods presented 
however  it has and could have a material effect on interest expense based on inflation s impact on amounts borrowed and prime and libor borrowing rates 
conversely  when raw material prices decline  as in and  customer demands for lower prices have and could result in lower selling prices and  as the company uses existing steel inventory  lower margins 
changing steel prices therefore could adversely affect the company s net sales  gross margins and net income
