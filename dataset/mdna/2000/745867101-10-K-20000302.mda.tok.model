quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued pmc  operating as a mortgage banker  is also subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk begins when pmc commits to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms ie  commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time 
the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor 
during and  this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately days 
in periods of rising interest rates  the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 
in order to minimize the interest rate risk pmc i finances the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the federal funds rate and ii hedges its loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities  whole loan investor commitments  options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities 
pmc does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
