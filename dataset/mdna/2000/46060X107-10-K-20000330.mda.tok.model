item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
except for the historical financial information  the matters discussed in this document may be considered forward looking statements 
such statements include declarations regarding our intent  belief or current expectations 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under the risk factors heading below 
overview we are a leading source for e business security management solutions 
our security management approach to information security protects distributed computing environments  such as internal corporate networks  inter company networks and electronic commerce environments  from attacks  misuse and security policy violations  while ensuring the confidentiality  privacy  integrity and availability of proprietary information 
we deliver an end to end security management solution through our safesuite security management platform coupled with around the clock remote security monitoring through our managed security services offerings 
our safesuite family of products is a critical element of an active internet and networking security program within today s world of global connectivity  enabling organizations to proactively monitor  detect and respond to risks to enterprise information 
our managed security services offerings currently provide remote management of the industry s best of breed security technology including firewalls  virtual private networks  or vpns  anti virus  url filtering software  and security assessment and intrusion detection systems 
we focus on serving as the trusted security provider to our customers by maintaining within our existing products the latest counter measures to security risks  creating new innovative products based on our customers needs and providing education  consulting and managed security services 
we generate a majority of our revenues from our safesuite family of products in the form of perpetual licenses and subscriptions  and sales of best of breed technology products developed by our partners 
we recognize perpetual license revenues from iss developed products upon delivery of software or  if the customer has evaluation software  delivery of the software key and issuance of the related license  assuming that no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
when payment terms are extended over periods greater than months  revenue is recognized as such amounts are billable 
product sales  consisting of software developed by third party partners combined in some instances with associated hardware appliances and partner maintenance services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
if maintenance is subcontracted  as with partner maintenance services  the revenue less the related subcontract expense is recognized when the contract is placed in service 
annual renewable maintenance is a separate component of each perpetual license agreement for iss products with revenue recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
subscription revenues include maintenance  term licenses  and managed service arrangements 
term licenses allow customers to use our products and receive maintenance coverage for a specified period  generally months 
we recognize revenues from these term agreements ratably over the subscription term 
managed services consist of monitoring services of information assets and systems and are recognized as such services are provided 
professional services revenues include consulting services and training 
consulting services  typically billed on a time and materials basis  assist in the successful deployment of our products within customer networks  the development of customers security policies and the assessment of security policy decisions 
we recognize such professional services revenues as the related services are rendered 
we believe that our total solutions approach will grow all of our revenue categories 
this includes our products and managed services offerings  as well as maintenance  consulting and education 
while we expect the expansion of these product and service offerings to originate primarily from internal development  our strategy includes acquiring products  technologies and service capabilities that fit within our strategy and that potentially accelerate the timing of the commercial introduction of such products and technologies 
over the last months  we have made four different acquisitions  each of which included such products  technologies or service capabilities 
two of these acquisitions  netrex  inc and njh security consulting njh  were completed in the third quarter of founded in with a current services customer base of more than customers  netrex is a leading provider of remote  security monitoring services of digital assets 
njh security consulting includes a technology foundation to provide an outsourced solution for the automatic detection and management of customers security risks using iss software solutions 
this technology is being incorporated into our managed security service offerings 
these transactions have been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
our consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to include the results of netrex 
the acquisition of njh was not material to our consolidated operations and financial position and  therefore  our operating results have not been restated for this transaction 
our operating results include the results of operations of njh since the date of acquisition 
our business has been growing rapidly 
although we continue to experience significant revenue growth  we cannot assure our stockholders that such growth can be sustained and  therefore  investors should not rely on our past growth as a predictor of future performance 
we expect to continue to expand our domestic and international sales and marketing operations  increase our investment in product development  including our proprietary threat and vulnerability database and managed services capabilities  seek acquisition candidates that will enhance our products and market share  and improve our internal operating and financial infrastructure in support of our strategic goals and objectives 
all of these initiatives will increase operating expenses 
thus  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
as a result  while we narrowed our operating losses over the course of and achieved profitability throughout  we cannot be certain that we can sustain such profitability 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated historical operating information  as a percentage of total revenues  for the periods indicated year ended december  product licenses and sales subscriptions professional services total revenues cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization charge for in process research and development merger costs total costs and expenses operating income loss revenues our total revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in revenues from product licenses and sales increased from million in to million in  and to million in historically we have generated most of our revenues from product licenses and sales  which represented of total revenues in  in and in licenses of our safesuite product family represented between and of product licenses and sales from through our vulnerability assessment products continued to grow each year in absolute dollars but decreased as a percent of total revenues  offset by the rapid growth of our realsecure intrusion detection products and initial sales of our security management application  safesuite decisions  which was introduced in late our revenues from sales of partner software and hardware appliances increased each year in absolute dollars  while representing between and of overall product licenses sales and in each period 
we continued to add significant functionality to our safesuite product family  providing customers with more powerful and easier to use solutions for security management across the enterprise 
the sales of partner software and hardware appliances are a part of our total solution approach whereby we provision partner products to provide a single solution source for our customers 
subscription revenues grew from million in to million in  and to million in  increasing from to of total revenues over this period 
subscription revenues consist of maintenance  term licenses of product usage and managed services 
professional services revenue increased from million in to million in  and to million in  representing in  in and in of total revenues 
we continue to build our service capabilities to address the demand from our customers for assessment  deployment  management and education services 
geographically  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within north america  however  international operations continued to be a significant contributor to revenues and a growing percentage of the business 
revenues from customers outside of north america represented in  in and in of total revenues 
no customer represented more than of our total revenues in any of these periods 
costs and expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of several components 
substantially all of the cost of product licenses and sales represents payments to partners for their products that we provision to our customers 
costs associated with licensing iss products are minor 
costs of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in and remained at the level in the decrease in was principally the result of improvement in gross margin on partner product sales 
cost of subscription and services includes the cost of our technical support personnel who provide assistance to customers under maintenance agreements  the operations center costs of providing managed services and the costs related to professional services and training 
these costs represented in  in and in of total revenues  with the percentage fluctuation due primarily to initiatives in the professional services area 
prior to  professional services represent training and implementation services provided by netrex 
in  we addressed the demand from customers for consulting services by building an iss professional services capability 
with that building effort behind us  the cost  as a percentage of revenues  declined in as staff utilization improved 
research and development research and development expenses consist of salary and related costs of research and development personnel  including costs for employee benefits  and depreciation on computer equipment 
these costs include those associated with maintaining and expanding the x force  experts dedicated to counter intelligence against hacker threats 
x force experts focus solely on researching and publishing information on the latest security risks  providing customers and the industry at large with critical data and protection measures to address the latest global security issues 
we continue to increase these expenditures  as we perceive primary research and product development and managed services offerings as essential ingredients for retaining our leadership position in the market 
we also increased the number of our development personnel focused on our best of breed products  enterprise applications  managed services offerings and research for future product offerings 
accordingly  research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in  and to million in these costs increased slightly as a percentage of total revenues  and we expect this percentage to stabilize in near the level 
we have reflected a charge of  in our statement of operations for identified in process research and development in connection with our october acquisitions of two companies engaged in microsoft windows nt  unix and database security assessment technologies 
the charge was based on a valuation of products under development using estimated future cash flows  reduced for the core technology component of such products and the percentage of product development remaining at the time of acquisition 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel expenses  commissions  advertising  maintenance of the our website  trade show expenses  costs of recruiting sales and marketing personnel and costs of marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in sales and marketing expenses increased in total dollars during these periods primarily from our larger workforce  which has increased each quarter since  both domestically and internationally 
sales and marketing expenses have decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  and to in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues is due to greater levels of productivity achieved by our sales force 
this is due to more experience in selling our broadening enterprise offering of products and services and the interest of the marketplace in such offerings 
in  our efforts will include the successful integration of the netrex sales personnel and continuing improvement of the quality of our sales force 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses of million in  million in and million in  represented approximately in  in and in of our total revenues 
general and administrative expenses consist of personnel related costs for executive  administrative  finance  human resources  information systems and other support services costs and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
the increase in these expenses in absolute dollars is attributable to our effort  through additional employees and systems  to enhance our management s ability to obtain and analyze information about our domestic and international operations  as well as the expansion of our facilities 
merger costs of million represented the direct out of pocket costs incurred in connection with two acquisitions that were completed in the third quarter of these costs are principally investment advisor  legal and accounting fees 
we also incurred amortization expense of  in and  in related to goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
interest income  net and exchange loss net interest income increased from  in to million in  and to million in primarily due to increased amounts of cash invested in interest bearing securities 
this increase in cash primarily resulted from the sale of equity securities 
the exchange loss of  in is a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  in and  in these provisions relate primarily to european operations 
prior to the merger  netrex profits were taxed at the shareholder level 
in  we utilized loss carryforwards to offset tax expense that would otherwise be recorded on profits from certain operations for as of december  substantially all loss carryforwards that would reduce future income tax expense related to united states operations have been utilized  however  we have approximately million of carryforwards related to the exercise of stock options which expire in and while income tax expense will be recorded on any future income before taxes related to united states operations  these carryforwards will reduce the related income tax payable and their use will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
we also have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards related to certain foreign operations and approximately million of research and development tax credit carryforwards which expire between and quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
as a result of our limited operating history and the risks associated with the new and rapidly evolving market that we serve  the operating results for any quarter below are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

cash provided by operations in totaled million  resulting primarily from net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million 
our investing activities of million in included the purchase of million of marketable securities  primarily interest bearing government obligations and commercial paper 
we also invested in equipment totaling million as we provided existing and new personnel with the computer hardware and software environment necessary to perform their job functions 
we expect a similar level of equipment investment in  assuming continued growth in our number of employees 
our financing activities provided million of cash in  which consisted of net proceeds of million from our march secondary stock offering  and million from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  consisting primarily of united states government agency securities  money market accounts and commercial paper carrying the highest investment grade rating 
we believe that such cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we expect to evaluate possible acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to ours 
although we have not identified any specific businesses  products or technologies that we intend to acquire or invest in  nor are there any current agreements with respect to any such transactions  from time to time we expect to evaluate such opportunities 
in the event we determine to pursue such opportunities  we may use our available cash and cash equivalents 
pending such uses  we will continue to invest our available cash in investment grade  interest bearing investments 
additionally  we have restricted marketable securities of million securing a million letter of credit issued in connection with our commitment to a long term lease of our future atlanta corporate operations 
risk factors forward looking statements are inherently uncertain  as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our forward looking statements should be considered in light of the following important risk factors 
variations from our stated intentions or failure to achieve objectives could cause actual results to differ from those projected in our forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
we have only recently achieved profitability we began operations in and have only achieved profitability in we operate in a new and rapidly evolving market and must  among other things respond to competitive developments  continue to upgrade and expand our product and services offerings  and continue to attract  retain and motivate our employees 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks 
as a result  we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to continue to operate profitably in the future 
our future operating results will likely fluctuate significantly as a result of our limited operating history  we cannot predict our future revenues and operating results 
however  we do expect our future revenues and operating results to fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including the growth in the acceptance of  and activity on  the internet and the world wide web  particularly by corporate  institutional and government users  the extent to which the public perceives that unauthorized access to and use of online information are threats to network security  the volume and timing of orders  including seasonal trends in customer purchasing  our ability to develop new and enhanced products  managed services offerings and expand our professional services  foreign currency exchange rates that affect our international operations  product and price competition in our markets  and general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
we increasingly focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide security solutions  which consist of our entire security management software platform and related professional services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  we expect that each sale may require additional time and effort from our sales staff 
in addition  the revenues associated with particular sales vary significantly depending on the number of products licensed by a customer  the number of devices used by the customer and the customer s relative need for our professional services 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our license revenues and results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software companies  many of our customers typically license most of our products in the last month of a quarter 
we cannot predict our operating expenses based on our past results 
instead  we establish our spending levels based in large part on our expected future revenues 
as a result  if our actual revenues in any future period fall below our expectations  our operating results likely will be adversely affected because very few of our expenses vary with our revenues 
because of the factors listed above  we believe that our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results likely will vary significantly in the future 
we face intense competition in our market the market for network security monitoring  detection and response solutions is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
our chief competitors generally fall within one of four categories internal information technology departments of our customers and the consulting firms that assist them in formulating security systems  relatively smaller software companies offering relatively limited applications for network and internet security  large companies  including axent technologies and network associates  that sell competitive products and offerings  as well as other large software companies that have the technical capability and resources to develop competitive products  and software or hardware companies that could integrate features that are similar to our products into their own products 
mergers or consolidations among these competitors  or acquisitions of small competitors by larger companies  would make such combined entities more formidable competitors to us 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they can also devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  these companies have reduced and could continue to reduce  the price of their security monitoring  detection and response products and managed security services  which increases pricing pressures within our market 
several companies currently sell software products such as encryption  firewall  operating system security and virus detection software that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted 
some of these companies sell products that perform the same functions as some of our products 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include the same kinds of functions that our products currently provide 
the widespread inclusion of comparable features to our software in operating system software or networking hardware could render our products obsolete  particularly if such features are of a high quality 
even if security functions integrated into operating system software or networking hardware are more limited than those of our software  a significant number of customers may accept more limited functionality to avoid purchasing additional software 
for the above reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we face rapid technological change in our industry and frequent introductions of new products rapid changes in technology pose significant risks to us 
we do not control nor can we influence the forces behind these changes  which include the extent to which businesses and others seek to establish more secure networks  the extent to which hackers and others seek to compromise secure systems  evolving computer hardware and software standards  changing customer requirements  and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
to remain successful  we must continue to change  adapt and improve our solutions in response to these and other changes in technology 
our future success hinges on our ability to both continue to enhance our current line of products and professional services and to introduce new products and services that address and respond to innovations in computer hacking  computer technology and customer requirements 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully develop and market new products that do this 
any failure by us to timely develop and introduce new products  to enhance our current products or to expand our professional services capabilities in response to these changes could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products involve very complex technology  and as a consequence  major new products and product enhancements require a long time to develop and test before going to market 
because this amount of time is difficult to estimate  we have had to delay the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products in the past and may have to delay the introduction of new products and product enhancements in the future 
the techniques computer hackers use to gain unauthorized access to  or to sabotage  networks and intranets are constantly evolving and increasingly sophisticated 
furthermore  because new hacking techniques are usually not recognized until used against one or more targets  we are unable to anticipate most new hacking techniques 
to the extent that new hacking techniques harm our customers computer systems or businesses  affected customers may believe that our products are ineffective  which may cause them or prospective customers to reduce or avoid purchases of our products 
risks associated with our global operations the expansion of our international operations includes our presence in dispersed locations throughout the world  including throughout europe and the asia pacific and latin america regions 
our international presence and expansion exposes us to risks not present in our us operations  such as the difficulty in managing an organization spread over various countries located across the world  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements in countries where we do business  excess taxation due to overlapping tax structures  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and export license requirements and restrictions on the export of certain technology  especially encryption technology and trade restrictions 
despite these risks  we believe that we must continue to expand our operations in international markets to support our growth 
to this end  we intend to establish additional foreign sales operations  expand our existing offices  hire additional personnel  expand our international sales channels and customize our products for local markets 
if we fail to execute this strategy  our international sales growth will be limited 
we must successfully integrate acquisitions we acquired netrex  inc and njh security consulting in as part of our growth strategy  we may continue to acquire or make investments in companies with products  technologies or professional services capabilities complementary to our solutions 
in our recent acquisitions as well as in future acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties in assimilating new personnel and operations into our company 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
these difficulties could also include accounting requirements  such as amortization of goodwill or in process research and development expense 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully overcome these risks with respect to any of our recent or future acquisitions or that we will not encounter other problems in connection with our recent or any future acquisitions 
in addition  any future acquisitions may require us to incur debt or issue equity securities 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute the investment of our existing stockholders 
we depend on our intellectual property rights and use licensed technology we rely primarily on copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have obtained one united states patent and have a patent application under review 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  our name recognition  our professional services capabilities and delivery of reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are similar to ours 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we cannot determine the extent to which piracy of our software products occurs  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments such as investments are not material
