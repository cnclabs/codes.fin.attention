because of changes in the development of the field of ultrasound contrast agents and in the parties development plans  alliance and schering amended the schering license agreement as of december  under the original arrangement  royalty rates were based upon the development of specific medical uses for imavist  which placed limitations on the development effort 
the parties elected to revise the royalty calculation which is now based on sales of imavist  a more traditional method of determining royalties 
this modification permits the parties to be flexible in developing imavist

the company is obligated to pay up to million to the former shareholders of mdv if advanced clinical development or licensing milestones are achieved in connection with mdv s technology 
the company will also make certain royalty payments on the sales of products  if any  developed from such technology 
the company may buy out its royalty obligation for million at any time prior to the first anniversary of the approval by us regulatory authorities of any products based upon the mdv technology the amount increasing thereafter over time 
all of such payments to the former mdv shareholders may be made in cash or  at the company s option  shares of the company s common stock  except for the royalty obligations which will be payable only in cash 
the company has not determined whether subsequent payments other than royalties will be made in cash or in common stock or  if made in cash  the source of such payments 
there can be no assurance that any of the contingent payments will be made because they are dependent on future developments that are inherently uncertain 
the company had net working capital of million at june   compared to million at june  the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased to million at june   from million at june  the increase resulted primarily from net proceeds of million from the issuance of preferred stock  proceeds of million from the sale of convertible debentures  proceeds from the sale of equity securities  and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and warrants  partially offset by net cash used in operations of million and principal payments on long term debt of million 
the company s operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
the company continually reviews its product development activities in an effort to allocate its resources to those product candidates that the company believes have the greatest commercial potential 
factors considered by the company in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and need  potential for regulatory approval and reimbursement under the existing healthcare system  status of its proprietary rights  technical feasibility  expected and known product attributes  and estimated costs to bring the product to market 
based on these and other factors  the company may from time to time reallocate its resources among its product development activities 
additions to products under development or changes in products being pursued can substantially and rapidly change the company s funding requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial expenditures associated with product development  particularly for imavist  liquivent and oxygent 
the company is seeking additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners for its non licensed products 
there can be no assurance that such relationships  if any  will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of its product development programs  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
alliance anticipates that its current capital resources  estimated proceeds of million from the convertible debenture offering in august  expected equity investments by baxter and expected revenue from investments will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements through at least fiscal the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  continued scientific progress in its research and development programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  patent costs  competing technological and market developments  changes in existing collaborative relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative relationships  and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
while the company believes that it can produce materials for clinical trials and the initial market launch for oxygent and imavist at its existing san diego  california facilities and for liquivent at its otisville  new york facility  it may need to expand its commercial manufacturing capabilities for its products in the future 
any expansion for any of its products may occur in stages  each of which would require regulatory approval  and product demand could at times exceed supply capacity 
the company has not selected a site for such expanded facilities and cannot predict the amount it will expend for the construction of such facilities 
there can be no assurance as to when or whether the fda will determine that such facilities comply with good manufacturing practices 
the projected location and construction of such facilities will depend on regulatory approvals  product development  and capital resources  among other factors 
the company has not obtained any regulatory approvals for its production facilities for these products  nor can there be any assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company currently has responsibility for manufacturing oxygent  however  baxter has the right to take over responsibility for manufacturing the product for sale in the baxter territory 
the schering license agreement requires the company to manufacture products at its san diego facility for a period of time after market launch at a negotiated price 
schering will be responsible for establishing production capacity beyond the maximum capacity of the san diego facility

other material and unpredictable factors which could affect operating results include  without limitation  the uncertainty of the timing of product approvals and introductions and of sales growth  the ability to obtain necessary raw materials at cost effective prices or at all  the effect of possible technology and or other business acquisitions or transactions  and the increasing emphasis on controlling healthcare costs and potential legislation or regulation of healthcare pricing

market risk the company is or has been exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term debt arrangements and  secondarily  its investments in certain securities
