item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company has two operating segments petrochemical processing and oilfield services 
petrochemical processing revenues are derived from grinding petrochemicals into powders size reduction using a variety of methods  including ambient grinding  cryogenic grinding and jet milling  providing ancillary services and selling grinding and other equipment manufactured by the company  compounding sales and services  which include the manufacture and sale of concentrates  and distributing plastic powders 
the company s distribution operations typically utilize the company s size reduction and compounding facilities to process petrochemical products prior to sale 
oilfield services revenues include revenues derived from exploration sales and services new tubular goods inspection  production sales and services reclamation  reconditioning and inspection of used tubular goods and sucker rods  corrosion control services coating of tubular goods and sucker rods  and other sales and services transportation services and oilfield engine sales and services in canada 
service revenues in both of the company s business segments are recognized as the services are performed or  in the case of product sales  revenues are generally recognized upon shipment to third parties 
cost of sales and services for the petrochemical processing and oilfield services segments is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies  and  in the case of concentrate manufacturing operations and the company s distribution business  purchased raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  management information system support  accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
gross profits as a percentage of revenue for the distribution and concentrate manufacturing businesses generally are significantly lower than those generated by the company s size reduction services 
several of the company s petrochemical processing subsidiaries  including the company s concentrate manufacturing and distribution operations  typically buy raw materials  improve the material and then sell the finished product 
in contrast  many of the company s size reduction operations  particularly the us locations  typically involve processing customer owned material referred to as toll processing 
the demand for the company s oilfield products and services depends upon oil and natural gas prices and the level of oil and natural gas production and exploration activity 
in addition to changes in commodity prices  exploration and production activities are affected by worldwide economic conditions  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  seasonal trends and the political stability of oil producing countries 
the oil and gas industry has been highly volatile over the past several years  due primarily to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
during fiscal and  the oil and gas service industry generally experienced increased demand and improved product and service pricing as a result of improved commodity prices and greater levels of oil and gas exploration and production activity  due largely to a strong world economy 
in fiscal  however  oil prices declined significantly versus fiscal levels 
while gas prices also declined during this period  they declined to a lesser extent 
these trends were attributed to  among other factors  an excess worldwide oil supply  lower domestic energy demand resulting from an unseasonably warm winter and a decline in demand due to the economic downturn in southeast asia 
as oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices declined during this period  demand for oilfield products and services  including those provided by the company  softened 
oil and gas prices continued to fall sharply in the first half of fiscal  with oil prices as measured by the spot market price for west texas intermediate crude reaching a low of less than per barrel and natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub spot market price reaching a low of per mcf during the first quarter of fiscal this year low  in real dollar terms  resulted in extremely depressed levels of oilfield exploration and production activity with the us drilling rig count falling to an average of only rigs during the third quarter of fiscal the company s oilfield service revenues and income were adversely impacted by these factors 
over the course of fiscal  oil and gas prices generally increased 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the price of oil rose to an average of per barrel and natural gas prices rose to an average of per mcf 
these trends have resulted in a strong recovery in demand for oilfield services generally  including those provided by the company  with the us rig count rising to an average of during the fourth quarter of fiscal furthermore  the company believes that many oil and gas companies will increase their capital spending levels in calendar year compared to the year while the predicted increase in spending is not assured  if correct  the demand for the company s oilfield services should continue to improve 
the company is also optimistic that  if oil and gas prices remain at or near their present levels  market conditions will remain very favorable for the company s oilfield services 
liquidity and capital resources the following are considered by management as key measures of liquidity applicable to the company cash and cash equivalents   working capital   current ratio debt to capitalization 
to 
to year ended september  compared to year ended september  fiscal cash provided by operating activities decreased to  from  for fiscal the decrease occurred despite higher net income due to the various changes in working capital accounts particularly changes of accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities and net deferred income taxes 
many of the working capital changes were driven by the revenue growth of the petrochemical processing and oilfield service business segments 
capital expenditures  excluding expenditures for business acquisitions  totaled  during fiscal  of which  related to the oilfield services business   related to the petrochemical processing business and related to general corporate expenditures 
these expenditures were made primarily to expand the company s operating capacity 
business acquisition expenditures  net of cash acquired  totaled in fiscal down from  in fiscal the company anticipates that available cash and or existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund fiscal capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased to  during fiscal compared to uses of  during fiscal the increase was the result of lower debt repayments  increased borrowings  lower preferred dividend payments although  of preferred dividends were declared in both fiscal and  and lower common stock dividend payments no common stock dividends were paid during fiscal compared to  in fiscal 
as of september   the company had approximately  of additional borrowing capacity available under various foreign credit arrangements 
currently  the company does not have a domestic credit facility 
the company anticipates that existing cash balances and the additional borrowing capacity provided by the foreign credit facilities will be an adequate source of liquidity for fiscal the terms of the company s senior notes limit the amount of liens and additional indebtedness incurred by the company 
the terms of the senior notes indenture also restrict the company s ability to pay dividends on preferred and common stock  however  the terms of the senior notes do allow for dividend payments on currently outstanding preferred stock  in accordance with the terms of the preferred stock  and up to 
per share  per annum on common stock  in the absence of any default or event of default on the senior notes 
the above limitations may not be decreased  but may be increased based upon the company s results of operations and other factors 
the company s foreign facilities are generally secured by assets owned by subsidiaries of the company and also carry various financial covenants 
the indenture pursuant to which the company s senior notes were issued contains a number of covenants including a prohibition on the incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of stock that is redeemable or is convertible or exchangeable for debt  provided that the company may incur additional indebtedness if the consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  will be at least to after such indebtedness is incurred  a prohibition on certain restricted payments  including  among others  the payment of any dividends  the purchase or redemption of any capital stock or the early retirement of any debt subordinate to the senior notes  subject to certain exceptions  certain prohibitions on creating liens on the company s assets unless the senior notes are equally and ratably secured  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  a prohibition against restrictions on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain distributions  payments or advances to the company  restrictions on the sale of assets of the company unless i the company receives the fair market value of such properties or assets  determined pursuant to the indenture  ii the company receives of the purchase price for such assets in cash or cash equivalents and iii the proceeds of such sale are applied pursuant to the indenture  a change of control provision that requires the company to repurchase all of the senior notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control change of control means i the sale  lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  ii the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the company  iii any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than of the total voting power of the voting stock of the company  iv or a majority of the members of the board of directors no longer being continuing directors 
continuing directors means the members of the board of directors on the date of the indenture and members that were nominated for election or elected to the board of directors with the affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the board at the time of such nomination or election  a prohibition of certain sale leaseback transactions  and restrictions on guarantees of certain indebtedness by the company s restricted subsidiaries 
the indenture also restricts certain mergers  consolidations or dispositions of all or substantially all of the company s assets

consolidated revenues increased  during fiscal  compared to fiscal the increases were due to revenue improvements in both the petrochemical processing and oilfield service business segments 
petrochemical processing revenues increased from  during fiscal to  for fiscal this increase of was mostly the result of an increase in compounding revenues and  to a lesser extent  an increase in distribution revenues  offset in part by the effect of the strength of the us dollar compared to the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  and the new zealand dollar 
distribution revenues rose  during fiscal compared to fiscal distribution revenues rose due to higher average resin prices and an increase in volumes sold in the company s european and southeast asian markets 
although revenues in europe have increased during fiscal  this increase has been largely offset by the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar approximately a decline 
size reduction services and other sales and services revenues declined to  during fiscal  compared to fiscal this small decrease was the result of greater domestic size reduction revenues more than offset by lower european revenues  largely caused by the depreciation of the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
compounding revenues rose dramatically from  during fiscal to  during fiscal this increase of  during fiscal was primarily the result of the fiscal capacity expansion at the company s bayshore industrial concentrate manufacturing facility in laporte  texas 
in addition  demand for the company s compounding products and services in europe increased in fiscal compared to fiscal oilfield service revenues increased  to  during fiscal compared to fiscal of this  increase   is attributable to the february acquisition of milcorp increased production sales and services  corrosion control services and other sales and services 
the remaining increase is due to a strong rebound within all the company s oilfield service product lines due to increased volumes resulting from greater customer demand 
the recovery is being driven by higher oil and gas prices which rose from an average of per barrel and per mcf during fiscal to per barrel and per mcf during fiscal as a result of these higher commodity prices  the north american rig count has risen from an average of during fiscal compared to an average of during fiscal if oil and gas prices remain at or near current levels  the company anticipates that oilfield service activity will generally continue to remain strong and  hence  the demand for the company s oilfield services will be strong 
the duration of the favorable market environment  however  cannot be predicted with any certainty 
cost and expenses 
consolidated gross margins calculated as the difference between net revenues and total costs of sales and services divided by revenues  increased slightly from during fiscal to during fiscal the slight increase was caused by the effect of higher oilfield service gross margins partially offset by lower petrochemical processing margins 
petrochemical processing gross margins were during fiscal compared to during fiscal this decline resulted primarily from a change in revenue mix 
during fiscal  compounding and distribution revenues in total  which generate lower gross margins than size reduction services  became a larger percentage of overall petrochemical processing revenues 
this trend caused overall petrochemical processing gross margins to decline 
additionally  international petrochemical gross margins softened during fiscal  due to higher production costs which adversely affected overall petrochemical gross margins 
oilfield service gross margins increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal higher volumes  due to strengthening market conditions  resulted in increased capacity utilization and  in turn  improved gross margins 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decline was primarily due to lower litigation related expenses and cost controls at the corporate level  partially offset by an increase in expenses resulting from the february acquisition of milcorp in canada 
as a percentage of revenues sales  general and administrative expenses improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement was the result of revenues increasing  while sales  general and administrative expenses declined 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized severance expenses of relating to terminated employees in europe 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from  during fiscal to  during fiscal this decline was the result of the effects of the charges relating to fixed assets and goodwill  offset  in part  by the impact of capital expenditures and the acquisition of milcorp 
fiscal charges during fiscal  the company recognized a  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets 
of this charge relates to the oilfield services business  of which of the write down related to the impairment of goodwill and the remaining to machinery and equipment 
 of the total charge relates to the petrochemical business and reflects the impairment of four underperforming facilities 
 of the petrochemical charge includes the impairment of goodwill and  consists of machinery and equipment impairment 
the amount of the machinery and equipment impairments were determined by comparing fair values with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
fair value was determined as the estimated current market value of the assets evaluated 
during fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of property  plant and equipment primarily due to assets which are obsolete or are not in working order and will not be used in the future 
of the  write down   related to the petrochemical business and related to the oilfield service segment 
during fiscal  the company recognized severance expenses of  relating to terminated employees 
of this charge  related to management changes within the company s european petrochemical processing operations 
the fiscal write off of start up costs of primarily relates to the closure  during the second quarter of fiscal  of an operation which had capitalized start up costs 
this operation had an immaterial impact on the company s financial results prior to the write off of capitalized start up costs 
operating income 
operating income loss increased from a loss of  during fiscal to  for fiscal the increase was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal for fiscal  the company had net interest expense of  this change was primarily due to higher average debt levels partially offset by increased rates of return on cash investments 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal this tax rate increase was the result of an increase in the amount of permanent differences including the goodwill impairment charges recognized in fiscal and non deductible goodwill amortization from acquisitions  relative to book pre tax income or loss  as well as a change in the mix of pre tax income or loss generated by the company s operations in various taxing jurisdictions 
the company has  for tax purposes   in net operating loss carryforwards nols which expire between and  and in investment  alternative minimum and other tax credit carryforwards which  if utilized  will result in a cash savings 
net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of  and of the tax credits are expected to expire unused 
a change in ownership under the internal revenue code has occurred which limits the utilization of  of the company s nols and credits to approximately each year through their expiration 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro  swedish krona  british pound  canadian dollar  new zealand dollar  and the australian dollar have impacted the translation of revenues and expenses of the company s international operations 
the table below summarizes the impact of changing exchange rates for the above currencies between fiscal and net revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  operating income pre tax income net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
consolidated revenues decreased  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decline is attributable to an oilfield service revenue decline partially offset by a petrochemical processing revenue increase 
petrochemical processing revenues increased from  during fiscal to  for fiscal this increase of was due to the acquisitions of jr courtenay jr in march  and soreco in june and an increase of domestic compounding revenues  offset  in part  by lower domestic grinding revenues and lower overall european revenues 
distribution revenues were  for fiscal year  an increase of  for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from the effect of the courtenay acquisition during march  partially offset by a decline in european distribution revenues 
size reduction services and other sales and service revenues declined  during fiscal to  compared to fiscal the decline resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for the company s products and services domestically and in europe 
compounding sales and service revenues increased  to  for fiscal this increase is mostly due to greater domestic compounding revenues  due in large part to a mid fiscal domestic compounding capacity expansion and the acquisition of soreco made in june oilfield service revenues declined from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this result represents a decline of  
the revenue decline was broad based  across all oilfield service product lines and was the result of declining demand for the company s oilfield products and services 
management responded to the lower fiscal revenues with significant cost reductions  particularly personnel reductions as described below 
declining demand was the result of depressed average oil prices and  to a lesser extent  gas prices during much of fiscal  which has resulted in significantly lower average rig counts in both the united states and canada during fiscal  compared to fiscal the revenue decrease was partially offset by the effect of the milcorp acquisition in february during the year ended september   the domestic drilling rig count averaged  a decline from the average of approximately during fiscal west texas intermediate crude prices improved from an average price of during fiscal to during fiscal during most of fiscal  oil prices rose  however  drilling activity in north america during fiscal was less than levels 
in fact  the us drilling rig count declined to only rigs on april  and rose very slowly throughout fiscal the decline in exploration activity is detrimental to the company s oilfield service business  not only from a revenue perspective  but also because this trend has the effect of lowering overall margins  since the company s exploration services sales usually generate higher gross margins relative to other oilfield products and services 
fortunately  production activity improved in the second half of fiscal  as evidenced by a improvement of the company s production services revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  over the third quarter of fiscal costs and expenses 
consolidated gross margins calculated as the difference between net revenues and total costs of sales and services divided by revenues  decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal gross margins declined during the year due to a decrease in oilfield service gross margins  partially offset by an increase in petrochemical gross margins 
petrochemical gross margins were during fiscal compared to during fiscal the improvement was primarily the result of an increase in domestic and european gross margins 
domestic gross margin gains resulted from cost cutting efforts  production efficiency improvements and an increase in domestic compounding volumes due in large part to the mid year fiscal capacity expansion 
european improvements resulted from a favorable revenue mix  along with the benefits of rising resin prices during the last half of fiscal oilfield service gross margins declined to for fiscal from in fiscal the decline was driven by lower volumes as costs were spread over less revenues  weaker pricing  due to very poor market conditions and a less favorable revenue mix 
additionally  during the second quarter  the company wrote down  of oilfield service inventory to estimated market selling prices  thereby increasing cost of sales expenses 
the company reacted to poor market conditions by rationalizing the cost structure of the oilfield service business to reflect the lower activity levels 
these cost reductions included a significant headcount reduction of the oilfield service workforce during the past year and a reduction of contract labor expenses 
additionally  during fiscal  most oilfield service salaried and hourly employees accepted a pay reduction 
the company s chairman cfo and ceo president also voluntarily accepted a pay cut 
in august  of the pay reduction was reestablished and  in december  the remaining portion was reinstated 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased  during fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease resulted from significant cost reductions within the oilfield service and domestic petrochemical businesses and lower corporate management compensation expenses 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of selling  general and administrative expenses due to the acquisitions of jr courtenay  soreco and milcorp and an increase in workers compensation expenses 
the decline in oilfield service and domestic petrochemical processing selling  general and administrative expenses were driven largely by staffing reductions 
as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in the increase is mostly due to the drastic decline in oilfield service revenues  offset partially by the expense reductions discussed above 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mostly the result of capital expenditures and business acquisitions during and during fiscal  the company recognized charges relating to the impairment of long lived assets  the write off of property  plant and equipment  severance expenses and write off of capitalized start up costs 
the charges are described in more detail within the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparing the year ended september  to the year ended september  operating income 
operating income decreased from  during fiscal to a loss of  during fiscal the decrease was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
gain on sale of equity investment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of  on the sale of an equity investment 
the company received cash of  and recorded an after tax gain of approximately  on the sale 
interest income expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal this change was primarily the result of lower cash balances due to acquisitions and internal capital expenditures 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal the effective income tax rate decrease was caused by a change of the mixture of pre tax income generated in different tax jurisdictions  a significant increase of permanent differences between taxable and book income primarily due to fiscal write down of impaired goodwill and the fact that the company s fiscal sale of an equity investment generated tax expense equal to of the pre tax gain 
extraordinary gain 
during fiscal the company repurchased senior notes with a face value of  at a discount  recognizing a pre tax gain of and an after tax gain of foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  the french franc  the australian dollar and the new zealand dollar did not materially impact the translation of revenues and income of the company s international operations during fiscal conversion to the euro currency the company has a substantial portion of its operations within countries that adopted the euro currency on january  the company has begun invoicing and receiving payments denominated in euros whenever possible 
the cost of achieving this has not been material 
the adoption of the euro by the european economic and monetary union is ultimately expected  from a competitive viewpoint  to benefit the company to some extent as price transparency becomes a reality 
at this time  the company continues to believe that the impact of adopting the euro with regard to currency exchange and taxation implications will not have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company

when words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  intend  expect  plan and similar expressions are used  they are intended to identify the statements as forward looking 
actual results  performance or achievements can differ materially from results suggested by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including results of operations  the company s financial condition  results of litigation  capital expenditures and other spending requirements  demand for the company s products and services and those described below and elsewhere in this document and those described in the company s other filings with the sec 
the significant indebtedness incurred in june as a result of the placement of the senior notes due has several important implications for the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to service the company s indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be restricted  iii the company s flexibility to expand  make capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be impaired future acquisitions may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly  which changes may significantly alter the leverage of the company  iv the indenture relating to the senior notes contains  and future agreements relating to the company s indebtedness may contain  certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  limitations on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens and other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or to merge or consolidate with another entity failure to comply with these provisions may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  and v the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to such indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and management  financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  some of which are not in the company s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all of the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates through its oilfield services business has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s oilfield services depends principally upon the level of domestic oil and gas drilling and workover activity  which  in turn  depends upon factors such as the level of oil and gas prices  expectations about future oil and gas prices  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  worldwide weather conditions  international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions and the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital 
oil prices and  to a lesser extent  gas prices declined significantly during  which resulted in decreases in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
oil and gas prices rebounded during and  and this improvement resulted in an increase in demand for the company s oilfield services 
no assurance can be given that the current market conditions will continue and  therefore  whether or not the demand for the company s oilfield services will decline in the future 
industry conditions will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company will have no control 
a decline in oil or gas prices or domestic oilfield activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s oilfield service business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  the oilfield services business is substantially seasonal  reflecting the pattern of oilfield drilling and workovers  with the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal years having generally higher levels of activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the business cycles of the company s petrochemical processing services segment are affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the various regions in which the company operates and changes in the cost of the petrochemicals produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  such business cycles may reflect cycles in the petroleum industry and oil and gas price changes  which affect both of the company s business segments and may make the company  as a whole  vulnerable to the effect of changes in the petroleum industry 
the operations of the company s oilfield services and specialty petrochemical processing businesses are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
over the past several years  the company has made many acquisitions  and management expects that other businesses will be acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates and their owners  or that the company will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company at all  or without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
there can be no assurance that businesses acquired will achieve sales and profitability that justify the investment made by the company 
any inability on the part of the company to control these risks effectively and integrate and manage acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may  to the extent allowed by agreements  incur indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company entered the specialty petrochemical processing industry with its acquisition of wedco in april  and had no experience in the industry prior to the acquisition 
since the acquisition of wedco  the company has expanded its specialty petrochemical processing operations by making numerous business acquisitions 
the success of the company will depend  in part  on the company s ability to continue the integration of acquired specialty chemical operations by  among other things  centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation among the businesses and the sharing of resources 
in addition  the growth of the company has and will continue to place significant demands on the company s management  internal systems and networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage or implement its plans for these operations or that  if implemented  such plans will be successful 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company began to expand the distribution aspects of its specialty petrochemical production services business through acquisitions of the existing businesses and the execution of supply agreements with certain resin suppliers 
these distribution operations  as well as the bayshore operation  require the company to buy and manage inventories of supplies and products and  in turn  to maintain greater levels of working capital than it has historically and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
a portion of the company s current operations is conducted in international markets  particularly the company s european and southeast asian specialty petrochemical processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations primarily through internal growth and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including  among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include equipment or product failures or work related accidents which could also result in personal injury  property damages  pollution and other environmental risks 
the company may not be fully insured against possible losses pursuant to such risks 
such losses could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business and is currently involved in numerous legal proceedings in connection with its operations and those of its acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial liability as a result of these or other proceedings 
the company is subject to numerous and changing local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning the use  storage  treatment  disposal and general handling of hazardous materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes  and restricting releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain and maintain certain permits and other authorizations mandating procedures under which the company will operate and restricting emissions 
many of these laws and regulations provide for strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from releases of regulated materials into the environment 
violations of mandatory procedures under operating permits may result in fines  remedial actions or  in more serious instances  shutdowns or revocation of permits or authorizations 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s past  present or future operations by courts or federal  state  local or foreign regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the revocation of any of the company s material operating permits  the denial of any material permit application or the failure to renew any material interim permit could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot predict what environmental laws and regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future law or regulation will be administered or interpreted 
to date  the company has incurred compliance and clean up costs in connection with environmental laws and regulations and there can be no assurance as to future costs 
in particular  compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations  more vigorous enforcement policies  or stricter interpretations of current laws and regulations  or the occurrence of an industrial accident  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
each of the industries in which the company participates is highly competitive 
some competitors or potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial or other resources than the company 
the inability of the company to effectively compete in its markets would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is party to various arbitration and litigation proceedings 
the results of such matters are uncertain 
there can be no assurance that adverse results in such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures include debt obligations carrying variable interest rates  and forward purchase contracts intended to hedge accounts payable obligations denominated in currencies other than a given operation s functional currency 
the company s strategy has typically been to finance only working capital with variable interest rate debt and to fix interest rates for the financing of long term assets 
forward currency contracts are used by the company as a method to establish a fixed functional currency cost for certain raw material purchases denominated in non functional currency usually the us dollar
