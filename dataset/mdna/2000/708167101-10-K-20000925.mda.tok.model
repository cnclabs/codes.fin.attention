item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank and its subsidiaries and the trust 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
management strategy management s primary goal will continue to be improved earnings  while managing risks  including liquidity and interest rate risks  so as to enhance stockholder value  while fostering and maintaining customer confidence 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing core deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company will continue to emphasize production through origination and purchase of traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in new jersey 
the company produced million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans on residential real estate which totaled billion or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  during fiscal  in an effort to mitigate the effects of low interest rates and a flat yield curve  the company sold approximately million of low coupon  longer duration one to four family mortgage loans 
due to a majority of one to four family residential mortgage loan production being adjustable rate and due to the higher interest rate environment during the year ended june   loan sale activity was reduced significantly from the fiscal levels  as the majority of production was retained in portfolio 
for the year ended june   the company sold loans totaling million 
the level of such activity will continue to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk and long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
in early fiscal  the company engaged in loan sales activity in an effort to provide liquidity  manage interest rate risk and to help mitigate the effects of the flat yield curve 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company will continue its emphasis on increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan porfolios as a percentage of total loans 
such loans reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   and commercial and multi family and consumer loans represented  and  respectively  of the total gross loan portfolio 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and collection efforts and aggressive marketing of real estate owned properties 
in addition  the company has occasionally restructured loans in order to return the loan to a performing status 
as a result  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was at june  increasing core deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
the company will continue to emphasize growth in lower costing core deposits  primarily checking deposits 
checking deposits increased million  or  in fiscal and million  or  in fiscal managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than weekly to price loan and deposit products and monthly to develop  implement and review strategies and policies to manage interest rate risk 
the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan and deposit products  including the focus on the production of first mortgage products with adjustable rate features and or with shorter terms to maturity  as well as the origination of commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loans which generally have shorter expected average lives or reprice at shorter intervals than one to four family residential first mortgage products 
the company has also engaged in one to four family mortgage loan sales whereby longer duration conventional loans have been sold 
furthermore  as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized checking products and utilized intermediate longer term borrowings and has at select times emphasized longer term certificates of deposit 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company has and will continue to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
total service charges and other non interest income  excluding the net gain on sales of loans and real estate operations  reflected a  or  increase for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to growth in checking accounts and earnings from the bank sinvestment services at penn federal program 
the program gives customers convenient access to financial consulting advisory services and related uninsured non deposit investment and insurance products at local branch offices through a non affiliated entity 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which includes ongoing reviews of staffing levels  facilities and operations 
the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year if their stated interest rates are at or above current market rates 
if the stated interest rate is below current market rates  these callable securities are assumed to be called at an estimated average life of approximately years 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by call date or contractual maturity date 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes that savings account balances decay gradually over time 
based on historical information  of such balances roll off within one year  roll off in the second year  roll off in the third year  and roll off each year thereafter 
at june   million  or  of savings accounts roll off after five years 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit

at june   the company s total deposits  borrowings and trust preferred securities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year by million  representing a one year negative gap of of total assets  compared to a one year negative gap of of total assets at june  see asset liability strategy 
the company s negative gap position widened from june  due in part to a decline in prepayments and a rise in short term funding balances 
asset cash flows lengthened as mortgage rates steadily increased and refinancing activity slowed significantly 
to mitigate the negative impact such activity had on interest rate risk  the company focused on increasing balances of adjustable rate one to four family loans  as well as fixed and variable rate consumer loan products  whose repayment and repricing characteristics are typically faster than their fixed rate one to four family counterparts 
funding challenges surrounding the year concerns resulted in a slight increase in short term deposits  but efforts to increase core deposit balances and medium term funding also proved successful throughout the year 
interest rate swaps  designed to synthetically lengthen the maturities of short term deposits  were reduced to million in notional amount at june  from million in notional amount at june  due to million of maturities and million of early terminations 
this decline in the hedge portfolio resulted in a deterioration of the company s negative gap position 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also regularly monitored by management through selected interest rate risk irr measures  including an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a low initial npv ratio or high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure was 
though npv is measured on an unconsolidated basis for regulatory purposes  it is managed on a consolidated basis 
as of june   the company s internally generated initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions and  as such  generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk ie  higher post shock npv ratio and lower sensitivity measure than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s unconsolidated irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the bank with the ots  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would decrease from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years  and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically sold a portion of its one to four family whole mortgage loan portfolio in an effort to shorten the average life and duration  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
the level of such activity will continue to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk and long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate and longer term borrowings  subject to market conditions 
the company has focused on developing and strengthening customer relationships in an effort to improve earnings and funding stability 
several products offering pricing incentives and or special features have been developed to reward customers with multiple accounts such as bi weekly mortgages and penn preferred checking 
the company has also emphasized growth in core deposit accounts  particularly checking accounts  as such funds are lower cost alternatives  are relatively stable and  thus  have a longer duration and assist in strengthening customer relationships 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was employed to manage the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
higher market rates of interest  slower prepayment speeds  and a flat treasury curve resulted in a million increase in one to four family first mortgage loans between june  and june  adjustable rate one to four family loans accounted for million or of the increase 
consumer loan balances increased million  million in prime based home equity lines of credit  the remainder principally in fixed rate second mortgages and other products of shorter duration than one to four family residential mortgages 
commercial and multi family real estate loan balances grew million during the fiscal year with million of the growth in adjustable rate products 
due to a majority of one to four family residential mortgage loan production being adjustable rate and due to the higher interest rate environment during the year ended june   loan sale activity was reduced significantly from the fiscal levels  as the majority of production was retained in portfolio 
the level of such activity will continue to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk and long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
in early fiscal  the company engaged in loan sales activity in an effort to provide liquidity  manage interest rate risk and help to mitigate the effects of the flat yield curve 
at june   medium and long term certificates of deposits with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million compared to million at june  the lengthening of certificates of deposit maturities was complemented by a million increase in checking account balances  offset by million decline in savings and money market account balances 
furthermore  wholesale borrowings with remaining maturities greater than one year stood at million at june   reflecting growth of million when compared to june  short term retail and wholesale funding balances with remaining maturities less than one year grew million between june  and june  generally  the investment policy of the company is to invest funds not utilized in its lending activities or required for other corporate purposes among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the company s asset liability management policies 
investments generally include us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the company s cost of funds responds more rapidly to changes in interest rates than its yield on earning assets due to the shorter terms of its funding portfolios 
consequently  the results of operations are influenced by the levels of short term interest rates 
the company offers a range of maturities on its deposit products at competitive rates and monitors the maturities on an ongoing basis 
additionally  the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
the balances of savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  which represented approximately of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives
