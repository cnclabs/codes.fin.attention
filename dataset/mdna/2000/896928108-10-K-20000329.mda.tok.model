tripos undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements in this form k 
industry background the success of companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and agrochemical industries is substantially dependent upon their ability to identify new pharmaceutical and chemical compounds with targeted activities and properties that can be brought to market rapidly and on a cost effective basis 
the discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or chemical product candidate typically involves many investigative phases  including storage  retrieval  analysis  review  communication  management and manipulation of large volumes of information relating to chemical structures and properties  molecular patterns  statistical information  reactions involved in syntheses and biological properties 
based on industry data  the average pharmaceutical discovery process requires synthesis and testing of more than  chemical compounds for each new product brought to market 
tripos estimates that up to of the expense of new product research and development arises in the pre clinical phases of new pharmaceutical development  the equivalent pre approval phase of agrochemical product development and product discovery phases of chemical research 
industry pressure to reduce product development cost and time to market are in part attributable to increased competition and increased political  regulatory and consumer scrutiny 
by reducing the time to market  pharmaceutical companies can generate substantial amounts of additional profits 
in addition  environmental regulations and consumer activism are forcing chemical and agrochemical companies to evaluate alternative products and means of doing business  thereby increasing their product development and operating costs 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have focused their r d efforts on both novel compounds exhibiting demonstrable benefits over existing commercial drugs and on novel targets  many of which are emerging from work being done on the human genome project 
many companies are implementing high throughput screening laboratories with robotic systems for the rapid analysis of large numbers of compounds for biological activity 
an outgrowth of this development is the increased need for material to screen  or to test 
companies are buying thousands of compounds a year to screen in order to find a novel compound with the desired biological activity 
tripos solution integration of software  research and services tripos believes it offers a uniquely integrated suite of discovery information and analysis software tools and related software support and services  specially designed lead chemical compounds  and discovery research services 
we seek to accelerate our customers product discoveries and time to market through offering the opportunity to outsource research and discovery activities that can not be efficiently performed in house 
the key elements of this strategy include state of the art software products and software consulting services that aid in the identification of new chemical compounds for use in the product discovery process as well as in the production of high volumes of new chemical compounds used in the discovery process  a proprietary library of over  potential lead compounds which we believe can be used by multiple customers on multiple projects to support new product discoveries  discovery research services that enable customers to more efficiently and rapidly design multiple series of related chemical compounds to enhance the discovery process  integration of informatics software and discovery research services to maximize the effective contribution to new discoveries  and a worldwide focus to our customer base  which has resulted in strategic arrangements with many leading pharmaceutical as well as emerging biotechnology companies 
tripos has successfully demonstrated the integration of software  research and services through its collaborations with arena pharmaceuticals and the wolfson institute 
the rapid and efficient discovery in these collaborations resulted in two lead series of compounds progressing from inception to in vivo biology in less than nine months that are now being actively marketed to the pharmaceutical industry 
products and services 
tripos offers a complementary range of new research technologies including discovery software  software consulting services and discovery services

our customers have always ranked us highly when it comes to providing helpful and timely assistance 
discovery research services with the rapid changes in technology and the fluctuating demand for high level capabilities driven by project initiations and terminations  outsourcing chemistry in discovery research is increasingly valuable to the life science industries 
tripos provides discovery research services in high throughput and medicinal chemistry to identify  refine  and optimize compounds for our customers guided by our specialized design and analysis expertise 
recent advances in the area of high throughput screening rapid screening of compounds for biological activity have given rise to the need for large numbers of information dense compounds by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other life science companies 
these companies routinely acquire thousands of compounds per year to screen in search of novel classes of active compounds 
by applying tripos compound design technology in conjunction with its synthesis capabilities  we have brought to market leadquesttm  a growing compound library that now includes over  compounds that meet our diversity and purity criteria 
this library provides an efficient source of compounds for screening eliminating the redundant and impure samples from the screening effort that are characteristic of other commercial and internal screening collections 
when leadquest compounds demonstrate activity in pharmaceutical company assays  we can quickly and efficiently provide hundreds of similar compounds for follow up screening  lead optimization and scale up synthesis for interesting compounds 
tripos has invested substantially in state of the art chemistry in the form of screening libraries  follow up target focused libraries and medicinal chemistry 
in  we purchased receptor research limited 
tripos receptor research is now fully integrated into our worldwide operations and is drawing strength from and providing invaluable insights to the overall organization 
this aspect of the business is both product and service oriented 
we sell  broadly and non exclusively  designed libraries of chemicals for biological screening and also offer specialized libraries designed to customer requirements based on the results of their biological testing 
tripos also uses the tripos receptor research facilities to participate with collaborators in its own therapeutic discovery projects 
our unique position with respect to informatics and analysis gives us a distinct advantage in this competitive chemistry market 
the collaborative research group s focus is on internal discovery collaborations with arena pharmaceuticals and the wolfson institute 
tripos is combining its strengths in molecular design  combinatorial chemistry  and data capture with the pioneering expertise of complimentary organizations 
our investments and collaborative efforts are structured to deliver long term revenue and profits based on successful research that leads to new broad based products when partnered with pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and related companies 
this unit is dedicated to managing efforts critical to the success of these projects and investments 
our goal is to partner these compounds with pharmaceutical companies for an upfront license fee and milestones related to any further development 
tripos has developed a unique and proprietary technology for the storage and searching of vast numbers of combinatorial products and related data called chemspacetm 
the unique searching methods enable the user to identify new compounds that are likely to have similar activity to the original molecule while avoiding problematic side effects or toxicity 
using this technology  tripos has rapidly created a database of trillions of synthetically accessible small organic chemical structures that are searchable in real time at the rate of two trillion per hour 
the database can be customized to include reactions and compounds that are proprietary to an individual customer project 
tripos may license this technology to a limited number of pharmaceutical companies as a highly valuable part of contract research relationships 
chemspace has proven to be an invaluable tool in performing the compound design activities in both contract research and collaborative research relationships 
hardware sales tripos resells computer systems manufactured by silicon graphics inc to its customers upon request 
we do not have an inventory of systems on hand  but merely facilitate the customers orders 
we provide this service as a convenience to our customers and do not expect nor realize high margins on these products 
sales  marketing and distribution tripos sells its software products directly in the us and europe  through an exclusive distributor arrangement in japan  and through non exclusive agency relationships in korea  china  singapore  india and australia 
on december   our sales force consisted of management  technical  sales and administrative employees for the united states and canada  in europe  and for the pacific rim 
our domestic sales and support center is located at our headquarters in st 
louis  missouri 
we also maintain sales offices in california  new jersey  massachusetts  and near london  paris and munich 
historically  for our software product lines for workstations  tripos employed separate teams selling each product or service 
these teams  which included scientists working in collaboration with our sales employees  have developed a consultative sales approach through which we have created relationships with our key customers 
we believe these relationships enable us to understand and better serve the needs of our customers 
because our customers frequently have both domestic and international operations  our sales staff and scientists in foreign locations work closely with their counterparts in the united states to ensure that our customers international needs are met in a coordinated and consistent fashion 
for  tripos sales organization will leverage its customer contacts by having each team represent all products and services 
tripos sells its workstation based software products in a variety of ways  one of which is term licenses on the basis of a fixed number of simultaneous users per module 
network based licensing is available  based on a count of the number of simultaneous users 
we have also introduced one  two and three year token license options that offer customers the ability to tailor their product selections to their specific research needs and that are renewable at the end of the selected terms 
we expect our customer base to migrate to shorter term license renewals based on the flexibility to access more of our software products 
these arrangements are expected to provide a predictable recurring revenue stream from periodic renewals 
software packages consisting of modules typically purchased by customers in particular industry segments have been defined and have been specially priced to facilitate customer purchase of an optimal module set for their problems 
software consulting services are sold on a collaborative basis  by direct salespeople and scientists  to the end user chemist and information technology departments at the customer site 
each contract is negotiated based on the custom software service needs of the customer 
the term of the contract is highly variable but current examples range from two weeks up to two years 
tripos provides programming and scientific expertise on a cost plus margin basis 
services may include specifications  gap and risk assessment  and full biological and chemical data integration 
historically  sales of the compound libraries were made through a staff dedicated to the product  however  beginning in  all sales representatives will offer these products 
the leadquest library now includes over  compounds that are available for purchase 
the compounds are sold on a nonexclusive basis to all purchasers and tripos retains no trailing rights to the compounds once they are purchased by a customer 
tripos sales staff includes employees with phd degrees in chemistry  various advanced degrees in the sciences and work experience with various hardware and software suppliers as well as with the industries we serve 
our sales representatives are compensated through a combination of base salary  commissions and bonuses based on quarterly and annual sales performance 
in addition  our pre sales scientists  all of whom have phd degrees in chemistry or a closely related field  receive total compensation determined in part by their success in supporting and generating sales in a particular territory 
contract research and software development relationships are offered through a team comprised of salespeople  discovery scientists and members of the senior management staff 
this approach is best suited for the long cycle required to develop meaningful partnerships with key customers for the outsourcing of discovery research 
tripos exhibits its products and services at various scientific conferences and trade exhibitions  including national and regional conferences of the american chemical society  at the ibc drug discovery conference  society for biomolecular screening and the chi high throughput screening for drug discovery conference 
tripos scientists frequently publish and present results of original research at these and other conferences throughout the world 
tripos sells its personal computer software products principally through direct mail and relationships with distributors 
customer training  service and support tripos licenses typically provide a limited warranty for a day period 
thereafter  support of our software products is provided for an annual fee 
approximately of our commercial customers and of our academic customers have contracted for support service 
this service gives customers access to telephone consultation with our technical personnel in local offices  on line access to a company operated computer bulletin board  new release versions of licensed software and other support required to utilize our products effectively 
tripos offers customer training in the use of its products through staff knowledgeable in both chemistry and computer science 
we send technical newsletters  bulletins  and advance notification about future software releases to our customers to keep them informed and to help them with resource allocation and scheduling 
we also sponsor seminars throughout the world for our customers  involving presentations both by our personnel and guest lecturers 
these seminars are designed to enhance customer understanding of our products and their potential utilization as an aid to customer research requirements 
we currently provide our customers with advice on computer system configuration management and frequently provide customers with consulting advice in addressing particular research questions as part of the normal pre and post sales process 
product development tripos believes that its position as a leader in discovery products and services will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness  integrate complimentary third party products and meet a rapidly evolving range of customer requirements 
we intend to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development to meet our customers demands 
we have previously experienced delays in developing new products ranging from a few days to approximately twelve months 
the complexity of developing new and enhanced scientific information management software in a client server environment is significant 
delays or unexpected difficulties in any segment of a development project can result in late or undeliverable product 
in view of this complexity  there can be no certainty that we will be able to introduce our products on a timely basis in the future  or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
tripos research and development activities are undertaken by its discovery software group and its discovery services group 
the discovery software group  composed of chemists and other scientists  works closely with customers to identify market needs for new products 
upon identification of a market need for a new product  the discovery software group collaborates with our software engineers to develop requirements and specifications  implement code and perform regression tests for the new product 
separate quality assurance  environment management and systems groups manage the final release  documentation and porting of the new product to all supported platforms 
in addition  tripos funds research at certain academic institutions 
we believe that this funding allows us to gain access to significant technology not otherwise available 
we enter into funded research and development arrangements with major pharmaceutical customers to develop software tools crucial to data capture and management in high throughput environments 
tripos derives discovery service revenues from its compound library product  leadquesttm  and discovery contract research services 
through an alliance with mds panlabs  inc  we sold the optiversetm compound library in and the first quarter of optiverse was a general screening library of over  diverse chemical compounds 
in early  a shift in the market demanded an increase in the level of purity of this product 
despite the anticipation of this demand and the purchase of a specialized apparatus for compound purification  the delay in receipt of this equipment and subsequent further delay in the purification process caused a nine month slippage in new product 
in early  we restructured our agreement with mds panlabs terminating our distribution of the optiverse product 
simultaneously  we shifted the focus of our newly acquired laboratory  tripos receptor research in bude  england  from contract research synthesis to synthesis for general screening libraries and announced the launch of our own leadquest compound library product 
in june  we purchased an inventory of highly pure diverse chemical compounds from a third party for distribution to continue generating revenue from this market 
in september  we opened our first laboratory facility suitable for all chemical synthesis operations 
we began production of newly designed screening libraries  started pilot projects for contract research and generated focused libraries in our internal therapeutic collaborative work with arena pharmaceuticals and the wolfson institute 
in may we opened our second and larger laboratory facility  providing us with the capacity to accommodate large library synthesis and contract research operations simultaneously 
by the end of  we had reached our targeted monthly synthesis and purification rate 
the inventory of compounds of the leadquest library has increased to over  highly pure compounds available for sale and we completed several contract research projects 
research and development expenses include all costs of software development and maintenance  all necessary expenses to deliver upon software consulting service contracts  all non capitalized costs associated with the production of compound libraries and all costs of fulfilling discovery research projects 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and sop  tripos capitalizes software development costs for both external and internal use 
tripos has entered into consulting contracts with certain customers that provide for collaboration in customizing chemical compound libraries for drug discovery in specific therapeutic areas 
we recognize revenue related to such agreements as contractual milestones are achieved and delivered or  absent such contractual milestones  on a completed contract basis 
our software consulting services consist of building customized systems solutions for our customers 
chemical research teams require improved information access and usage in their discovery process 
we help our customers meet these needs by applying our expertise in web technologies  chemical information systems  and biological data handling to build integrated systems designed specifically for the customer s environment and discovery process 
revenue is recognized as technology is delivered or services are performed 
proprietary rights tripos relies upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
license and non disclosure agreements are used to establish and protect the proprietary rights in our products 
we hold two key patents in the area of analysis of the relationship of chemical structure to activity  one issued in the early s on our sybyl qsar product and the other issued in on our hologram qsar 
from to  tripos applied for nine other software patents and  jointly with collaborators  for an additional four composition of matter or related use patents  all of which are patent pending 
the source code for our products is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished  copyrighted work 
in addition  our core software products are developed and manufactured only at our st 
louis facility 
tripos does not disclose the source code for its products to any of its distributors 
we supply our source code under special  restrictive license provisions to a very limited number of customers only on special request  none of which has been received in the last five years 
also  upon request  tripos has placed source code in escrow for use by a minimal number of designated customers for limited support purposes on a contingency basis 
all major software products are shipped from our st 
louis facility under a technical license management system that governs access 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to gain use of our products or technology without prior authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where tripos does business 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change 
while we believe that legal protection of our technology is an important competitive factor  we are aware that such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product development  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product support are important in maintaining a sustained technology leadership position 
tripos licenses its workstation software through the execution of license agreements 
we license our personal computer software products by use of a shrinkwrap license 
a shrinkwrap license agreement is a printed license agreement included within packaged software that sets forth the terms and conditions under which the purchaser can use the product and is intended to bind the purchaser  by the purchaser s acceptance of the software  to such terms and conditions 
tripos has a number of contracts with academic institutions and individuals providing it the right to license  market and use technology developed outside the company 
these products enhance our ability to offer an enriched product line and represent a material percentage of our annual revenue 
tripos general screening and targeted compound libraries  which are manufactured and shipped by tripos receptor research from its bude  england facilities  and the related synthesis methods and approaches  are protected by non disclosure agreements during the prospective customer s evaluation and or use 
compound  consulting  contract research and collaborative agreements entered into by tripos require specific documentation regarding defined proprietary rights  responsibilities of the parties  and or allowed use of any related compounds or libraries of compounds 
competition tripos operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  and evolving industry standards 
we compete with other vendors of software products designed for applications in analytical chemistry  computational chemistry  chemical information management  and combinatorial chemistry  the four principal areas in the chemical and pharmaceutical research market 
our discovery services group competes with other vendors for the sale of contract research  targeted libraries and diverse compound libraries 
competition is likely to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market 
the competition we experience in our existing and targeted markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
a number of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets are product quality  performance  reliability  ease of use  technical service  support  and price 
we expect that these factors will remain major competitive issues in the future  but additional factors will become increasingly important  including contribution to the overall efficiency of the research effort through enhanced integration  communication and analysis 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
production our software production operations consist of assembling  packaging  shipping of software and database products along with documentation needed to fulfill orders 
outside vendors provide printing of documentation  manufacturing of packaging materials and assembly of our desktop products 
we typically ship our software products promptly after the acceptance of a customer purchase order and the execution of a software license agreement 
accordingly  we do not generally have any significant software backlog  and we believe that a backlog at any particular time  or fluctuations in backlog  are not indicative of sales for any succeeding period 
leadquest chemical compounds are designed and manufactured at tripos receptor research in bude  england 
compound sales are shipped shortly after the execution of a sales contract between the customer and tripos 
the potential for backlogs exists in the delivery of compounds due to the nature of the materials to be accumulated  packaged and shipped along with the sometimes lengthy compound selection process of the customer 
backlogs will fluctuate based on the number  size and timing of orders received  and availability of product 
significant customers tripos does not derive or more of its total sales from any single customer 
international sales tripos sells its software products through its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and through a network of distributors in the pacific rim  australia and india 
net sales from the company s activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of total net sales in   and  respectively 
net sales in europe accounted for  and of net sales in   and  respectively  with the balance from customers in the pacific rim 
we believe that revenues from our foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  geographic segment data  later in this annual report 
employees as of december   tripos had a total of employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of that total  were engaged in marketing  sales and related customer support services  in product development  in chemistry laboratory activities and in operations  administration  mis and finance 
our future success is significantly dependent on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union nor covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good

overview tripos  inc is a leading provider of an integrated array of discovery software  software consulting services  and discovery research services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrochemical  and other life sciences industries 
tripos combines information technology and scientific research to optimize and accelerate molecular research for the discovery of new products by its clients 
tripos generates its revenues from a diversified offering of products and services 
our foundation is the software license and support products we sell to the life sciences industries 
in  over of software license revenues were sold to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  however  no single customer represented more than of revenues to tripos 
tripos licenses its software and support in the form of one to three year renewable contracts for any of its more than software modules available for sale 
in  of revenues were derived from the sale of software licenses and support 
tripos integration of chemistry and biological data in the life sciences industries creates a revenue stream for software consulting services 
tripos maintains a staff of specialists who use its proprietary data integration framework to configure customized solutions for data management 
revenues in were of total revenues  and we expect to increase sales activity to support future revenue growth 
revenue is generated on a billable rate per day and is recognized as services are performed 
tripos leverages its expertise in chemical compound library design technology to develop and manufacture general screening libraries for sale to the life sciences industries 
its current library of over  highly pure and diverse compounds  is marketed under the name leadquesttm 
in  of revenues were derived from the sale of this product 
tripos sale and manufacture of chemical compound libraries has created the opportunity to offer follow up contract research services to customers for design and synthesis of focused libraries for lead optimization 
a contract of this nature may be derived from the follow up of positive biological activity in a leadquest compound sold to a customer or may come from compounds originated by the customer 
in  of tripos revenues were generated by this activity 
in  tripos plans to market a comprehensive research process to its life sciences customers for rapid and cost effective discovery 
the process combines advanced informatics  chemistry and biology products and services  and proprietary discovery technologies for efficient lead development  refinement  and optimization 
tripos will also work with its collaborators to achieve the milestones associated with this type of contract 
these would be multi million dollar contracts and may include royalties and milestones 
in february  tripos entered into a strategic alliance with lion biosciences ag to integrate lion s bioinformatics with tripos cheminformatics expertise 
the companies intend to jointly market their products and services to the life sciences industry 
as part of this alliance  lion made a million investment in convertible preferred stock of tripos 
these funds are being used for general corporate purposes 
in  tripos created a strategic alliance with cyprotex  a newly formed company whose focus is development of in vitro screens and data modeling capabilities to predict biological reactions of new chemical entities 
these reactions are essential in determining the survival of new drug candidates 
tripos and cyprotex will jointly market their services to the drug discovery market 
in  tripos completed its investment in collaborative internal drug discovery programs with arena pharmaceuticals and the wolfson institute 
these collaborations generated  in a relatively brief nine month period  patented lead compounds that are actively being marketed for commercial development in partnership with a pharmaceutical company 
tripos does not expect to receive revenues from the licensing of these compounds before the second half of tripos also acts as a reseller of computer hardware in conjunction with software sales 
hardware sales are generally made to facilitate integration of tripos software into customer research activities and are not a focus of tripos sales activities 
tripos acts merely as an authorized reseller for a single vendor and does not maintain any inventory 
accordingly  margins on these sales are relatively modest 
tripos licenses its discovery software tools to customers  provides ongoing support  including upgrades selected by customers  and provides consulting services to its customers that enable integration of tripos discovery tools to customers discovery operations 
certain long term software licenses may  subject to certain rules of sop and sop  be recognized over the life of the contract 
tripos generally expenses its research and development costs associated with software enhancements and new software tools 
thus  a significant portion of the costs associated with development and enhancement of software is accounted for as research and development and not as a cost of software sales 
over the past two years  tripos has staffed its worldwide operations to efficiently execute its current business plan 
the quarterly expenses include the fixed costs of research and development for software development  software consulting services  and contract research 
tripos believes that its selling and administrative costs will remain constant on a quarterly basis 
variability in quarterly expenses primarily occurs in relation to the level of revenues for sales compensation and bonuses 
over the past two years tripos has used its capital resources to fund investments in the building of chemistry production facilities  chemical compound library inventories  collaborative drug discovery programs  staffing new business segments  and investments in arena pharmaceuticals 
in the future  tripos expects to dedicate available cash to maintain capital infrastructure and conduct operations 
tripos revenues and expenses vary from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  the timing of customers budget processes  the success of our sales efforts  the lengthy sales cycle and tripos ability to influence customers and prospective customers to make decisions to outsource portions of their discovery process  the size of the customers capital expenditure budgets  the ability to produce compound libraries in a timely manner  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products  the timing of new product introductions by tripos and other vendors  changes in pricing policies by tripos  partners and other vendors  consolidation in customer base  and changes in general economic and competitive conditions 
in addition  tripos may choose to negotiate a long term software license contract that may  subject to certain rules of sop and sop  be recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition policies 
a substantial portion of revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of orders and tends to be realized toward the end of each quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause quarterly results to fluctuate substantially 
tripos quarterly results can be effected by the mix of its revenue components 
except for the historical information and statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the matters and items contained in this document  including md a  contain certain forward looking statements that involve uncertainties and risks  some of which are discussed below  including  under the caption cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered 
tripos is under no obligation to update any forward looking statements in this section 
words such as expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  intends  plans  believes  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales  except costs of sales data  which is set forth as a percentage of the corresponding net sales data net sales software licenses support discovery services hardware total net sales cost of sales software licenses support discovery services hardware total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss net sales 
net sales decreased approximately from million in to million in  and increased in to million 
these fluctuations in net sales were principally attributable to sales of diverse chemical compound libraries and contract research in the discovery services business 
the increases in the discovery services business in were offset by declines in sales in the software license business 
new product sales represented of sales in  in  and in tripos generates a substantial portion of its revenues from the pharmaceutical industry 
net sales to this industry accounted for approximately   and of total net sales in   and  respectively 
net sales from activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales in europe accounted for   and of net sales in   and  respectively  with the balance from customers in the pacific rim area  principally japan 
tripos believes that revenues from its foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total net sales 
list prices for tripos software products have remained relatively stable over the last few years 
in  tripos started selling token software licenses in addition to term licenses 
a token license includes a minimum level of modules for a minimum total price 
in  and    and  respectively of software license sales were sold in the form of a token license 
as a result of selling more modules through token licenses  the average software license revenue per customer has increased 
the average sale price for chemical compound libraries decreased in and due to the demand for a highly purified product which caused a decline in the size and number of orders based on the availability of purified product for sale 
in  tripos new product offering which guaranteed greater than purity for every compound  allowed the price per compound to increase as the value of the compounds to customers increased 
existing customers represented of total net sales in and and increased to in increasing net sales from period to period is dependent  in part  on tripos ability to introduce new products and services  which are accepted by the market  and on tripos ability to penetrate new and existing markets 
software license sales increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increase from to was due to the strength of the sales to the biotechnology customer base in the decrease in was due to a decline in sales to the west coast biotechnology customer base which was not entirely offset by the increase in sales due to a new software development contract  the introduction of four new software products  and an increase in european and japanese software sales of 
support sales increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in the increase for the three year period is primarily due to a larger installed base of customers with more modules per customer as a result of the overall increase in software license sales in the prior years 
tripos derives discovery service revenues from its compound library product  leadquestt  and discovery contract research services 
discovery services sales decreased to million in from million in and increased to million in fluctuations in these sales are attributable to the repositioning of this business from the distribution of compounds manufactured by third parties to the distribution of compounds designed and manufactured with tripos staff and facilities 
prior to mid  tripos distributed a series of chemical compounds manufactured by a third party 
since that time  tripos has constructed a chemistry laboratory facility and produced a library of chemical compounds with the purity and in amounts sufficient to meet tripos projected sales needs 
tripos also offers contract research and other services for customers through these facilities 
see the business product development section of this form k for further discussion 
hardware revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased by to million in the decrease in and reflects the absence of new models of hardware offered during the past two years as well as customers decision to move from unix based platforms to windows nt systems 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased from million in to million in  and increased to million in  which represents  and  respectively  of total net sales 
the decrease in was due to the decrease in costs of diverse compound libraries as a result of the decline in sales of compound libraries 
in  the slight increase in cost of sales was caused by a increase in costs of sales corresponding to the increase in the compound library sales offset by a decrease in software license costs based on lower software amortization and royalty costs 
costs of software licenses represented  and of software license sales in   and  respectively 
costs of software licenses consist of amortization of capitalized software  royalties to third party developers  and the cost of software product packaging and media 
the cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license sales increased in due to an increase in third party royalties based on an increase in the number of third party software modules sold during the year 
in  the costs of software licenses as a percentage of sales declined based on a decrease in amortization in previously capitalized software and a decrease in third party royalties based on the mix of software modules sold 
costs of support represented  and of support sales in   and  respectively 
cost of support principally consists of software product packaging  media and updates to documentation 
the decrease in costs of sales for support in is due to lowered costs of documentation and electronic delivery of software applications 
the increase in is due to the costs of the release of a major upgrade to software 
costs of discovery services represented  and of discovery service sales in   and  respectively 
the cost of the discovery services business is represented by the costs of compound libraries 
in  the decrease in the costs as a percentage of discovery services sales was due to the significant increase in contract research sales  costs of which are reflected in r d 
costs of hardware represented  and of hardware sales in  and  respectively 
cost of hardware consists of the costs of hardware sold 
the company expects the cost of hardware as a percentage of hardware sales to remain relatively stable in future periods 
gross profit 
gross profit was million in  million in  and million in  which represents gross profits of  and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit margin in was due to the increase in software license and support sales and the decrease in the compound library and hardware sales 
the slight improvement in the gross margin in was due to the increase in contract research revenues in the discovery services business 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in the decrease in and was due to the overall decrease in commission based revenues and efficiencies created in sales management expenses 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in  and decreased to in the fluctuation in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales is a function of the overall fluctuation in sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in  representing   and of net sales  respectively 
the increases in and are due to the increase in chemistry staff at tripos receptor research  shared costs for the collaborations with arena pharmaceuticals and the wolfson institute  and an increase in staff and facilities for software consulting programmers 
research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in and million in which represents   and of net sales  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and sop  the company capitalizes software development costs for both external and internal use 
in  the capitalized costs of compound development were classified on the balance sheet under capitalized discovery services 
beginning in  tripos capitalized compound library production and design costs to inventory 
the total amount of costs capitalized were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this represented  and of total product research and development expenditures in these periods 
tripos anticipates that its investment in new product research will increase significantly as tripos continues to develop four new software modules per year  works on funded software development contracts with customers  increases diverse compound library production and performs contract research and software consulting services 
tripos reflects costs to fulfill discovery research  funded software development and software consulting service agreements in r d to better reflect the synergies of staff interaction  variability of staff utilization and of the outcomes from certain of these consulting contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and increased to million in  representing   and of net sales  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of sales in and is due to the addition of tripos receptor research administrative staff  worldwide infrastructure and it expansion  and a bonus reserve 
tripos expects general and administrative expenses to remain at comparable levels to in the future 
interest income 
interest income of  in   in and  in  was from interest earned on investments 
interest expense 
interest expense of  in   in  and  in was from interest due on the long term note payable for the corporate building  the line of credit  the term loan  and interest on capital leases 
other income expense 
other income expense was  in  million in  and million in in  other income was primarily from the recognition of the guaranteed settlement payment attributable to the transfer by tripos of the marketing and distribution rights of the optiverse product to mds panlabs 
in  other income was primarily from the gain on the sale of all of tripos equity holdings in phase molecular toxicology  inc income tax expense 
tripos tax expense was million in   in and  in the effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in reflects a valuation allowance on the net operating losses for subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
tripos believes that it will fully utilize these losses to offset future income tax expenses in the united kingdom 
the estimated tax benefit of these losses  to be realized in a future period  is approximately million 
the tax expense in is attributable to taxes on net income in the united states  france and germany 
liquidity and capital resources tripos working capital decreased from million in to million in the decrease in working capital is the result of the expansion of tripos receptor research limited and build up of compound inventories 
net cash used by operating activities in increased to million from million in this was primarily due to an increase in prepaid and other current assets of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in amortization of million  an increase in depreciation of million offset by a decrease in net income of million and a decrease in short term receivables of million along with a gain from the disposition of tripos equity interest in phase molecular toxicology of million 
in  net cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in to net cash used of million 
this was primarily due to a decrease in net income of million  an increase in short term receivables of million  an increase in inventory of million  an increase in notes receivable of million for customer accounts receivable due to long term installment sales offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million due to both increased support billings at year end and token license contracts for the year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in the decrease relates to the proceeds from the disposal of the phase investment partially offset by the note receivable from phase and the reduced level of investment in property and equipment at the laboratory facility in england 
tripos invests available cash in bank deposits  investment grade securities and  short term interest producing investments  including government obligations and other money market instruments 
tripos anticipates that fiscal capital purchases will decrease substantially below those of as the expansion of the facilities at tripos receptor research have been completed 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in to million in as tripos increased its utilization of its line of credit  issued a million term loan and financed equipment additions with capital leases 
the debt issuance was partially offset by principal payments on the long term debt and capital leases 
on february   lion biosciences ag invested million in the form of a convertible preferred private placement 
the proceeds from this investment were used to pay off the million term loan outstanding with lasalle bank 
the balance of the investment will be used to fund short term liabilities or to pay down the existing line of credit if warranted by changes in interest rates 
tripos believes that with its cash and accounts receivable balances  projected cash flow from operations  availability under a million line of credit  and the recent funding by lion biosciences  it will be able to meet both its liquidity needs and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months 
see note later in this annual report for further discussion of the credit facilities available to tripos 
tripos may seek to obtain additional financing in the future in connection with its product development efforts and its efforts to penetrate existing and new markets for its products and services 
decisions to access additional capital will reflect projected working capital needs  business expansion needs  possible acquisitions of complimentary business entities  and the availability of attractive financing alternatives 
foreign currency translations tripos foreign operations transact the majority of their business in their respective local currencies and are generally not exposed to foreign currency gains or losses 
due to the relative stability of the currency of the countries in which it operates and the level of investment in each country  tripos current intent is to retain assets within its foreign operations to fund those operations 
tripos foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been significant to date  and it believes the exposure to future foreign currency transaction gains and losses is minimal 
cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered tripos future results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report 
factors that could contribute to such differences  include  but are not limited to  the following expansion of services and sales activities 
tripos strategy of providing direct integration of sophisticated information technology with the experimental sciences in the form of chemical laboratories to produce faster  more cost effective new product discovery has not yet garnered widespread commercial acceptance 
this integrated approach also requires tripos sales force to broaden their existing knowledge base in selling discovery software to include selling software consulting services and discovery research services 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept tripos integrated approach or that competitors will not offer other approaches that gain greater technological acceptance 
future capital needs 
tripos may be required to raise additional capital in the near future to conduct operations through additional public or private equity financings  collaborative arrangements  borrowings or other available sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
dependence on pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
tripos has benefited to date from the increasing trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource chemical research and development projects 
a reversal or slowing down of this trend  a general economic downturn in these industries  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
tripos competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and research and academic institutions in size  relative expertise and sophistication  speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and developing and optimizing chemical processes 
these competitors may have greater financial and other resources and more experience than tripos in certain research and development methods 
protection of proprietary technology 
tripos success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets and copyrights  enforce restrictive licenses granted to third parties  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary or developed in collaboration with us  and conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
variations in quarterly operating results 
tripos historically has experienced stronger financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year followed by a comparative decline in the first and second quarters 
quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including lengthy sales cycles  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  timing of new product introductions  changes in pricing policies  changes in general economic and competitive conditions  seasonal slowdowns  and the timing and integration of acquisitions 
dependence on collaborators 
tripos commercial success depends on its ability to enter into joint venture or other collaborative arrangements with third parties 
to date  we have entered into numerous such arrangements with large pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish these collaborations  that any such collaborations will be on favorable terms  or that current or future collaborations will ultimately be successful 
dependence on key personnel 
tripos future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key technical and senior management personnel  in particular  its president and chief executive officer  dr 
john p 
mcalister  as well as key technical personnel on the software and laboratory side 
none of our key personnel is bound by an employment agreement or covered by an insurance policy where tripos is the beneficiary 
the loss of one or more key members could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive market for experienced scientists and programmers 
tripos competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and research and academic institutions for new scientific personnel 
we compete with consulting companies for experienced computer programmers to carry out our software consulting services 
we cannot assure that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel should the worldwide demand for these skilled individuals increase 
potential adverse impact of pharmaceutical and health care reform 
tripos expects that a substantial portion of its revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived from services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
if legislative proposals or reforms are adopted that have a material adverse effect on the businesses  financial condition  and results of operations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actual or prospective customers  tripos business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected as well 
year compliance 
in prior years  tripos discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the cost of remediating our systems was included in the capital and expense budgets for and did not materially differ from prior years 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with products  internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
tripos will continue to monitor mission critical systems throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a 
market risk s tripos exposure to market risks is limited to foreign exchange variances and fluctuations in interest rates 
neither foreign exchange nor interest rate exposure has resulted in a material impact on tripos 
tripos foreign exchange risk is presently limited to currencies that historically have exhibited only minor fluctuations 
assets outside the united states are primarily located in england 
tripos investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
the net assets in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rates were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
any loss in fair value would be reflected in other comprehensive income and would not impact tripos net income 
tripos foreign currency transaction gains and losses for and were immaterial 
tripos interest rate risk is attributable to its outstanding borrowings under its line of credit and mortgage loan 
tripos has fixed its floating rate interest risk on the mortgage loan through the purchase of a swap instrument 
tripos will continue to monitor its exposure to floating interest rate risk on outstanding line of credit borrowings and endeavor to mitigate this risk through the use of appropriate hedging instruments
