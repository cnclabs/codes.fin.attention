the company s e document delivery services offer high volume  simultaneous delivery of fax and email documents via the web  from desktop software or a fax machine 
since january  the company has made three strategic acquisitions  which were accounted for as purchases and one which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company acquired rightfax  a developer of lan based fax server software  in january in january  the company acquired selected assets and liabilities of telcom technologies  a developer of nt based open architecture acd systems 
in october  the company acquired commercepath  a developer of high volume production oriented fax servers 
in april  the company merged with mediatel corporation  a provider of e document delivery services  in a transaction which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with the rightfax  telcom technologies and commercepath acquisitions  the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million  million and million  respectively  in january  january and october for the write off of purchased  in process research and development  and recorded additional amounts of goodwill that are being amortized over future years 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company announced that its board of directors approved a two for one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend 
shareholders received an additional share of common stock for every share held on the record date of december  the additional shares were payable on january  accordingly  all share and earnings per share amounts set forth in this report are shown on a pre split basis and do not reflect the two for one stock split 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net sales the company derives net sales primarily from initial sales of software kits and licenses and fully integrated systems  document delivery services as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and product upgrades 
sales to dealers and distributors are recognized when the products are shipped 
the sales mix among the company s product categories and between software kits and fully integrated systems affects both net sales and gross margin 
because of their hardware components  fully integrated systems generate higher revenue per unit and lower margins than comparable software kits 
advanced cti application systems generally are sold at a higher unit price and with a higher gross margin than basic messaging systems due to the additional software modules purchased and the higher mix of software kits and software licenses as compared to fully integrated systems 
over the past three years  sales have shifted toward higher margin advanced cti products and software kits from lower margin cti ready systems and basic messaging products 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million in this increase resulted from increased sales across all product lines 
sales of exhanced fax products and services increased over and represented of net sales 
sales of advanced messaging increased during and constituted of total product sales 
sales of the lower margin basic messaging products were flat during and represented of net sales compared to of net sales in international sales for increased from  and represented of net sales 
years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased sales of enhanced fax products and services  and a full year of sales from our commercepath business unit  which on a combined basis increased in  and represented of net sales  as compared to of net sales in sales of advanced messaging and call center systems continued to strengthen during and constituted of total product sales in the lower margin basic messaging market continued to be affected by price pressures from competitive offerings 
basic messaging sales declined in from  and represented of net sales in compared to of net sales in international sales for increased from  and represented of net sales 
for the first quarter of  we expect net sales to be significantly lower compared to the first quarter of we believe our net sales are down for this quarter primarily as a result of the continuing impact of the year problem on both our channel partners and customers 
we believe that it departments are either recovering from fatigue of implementing year upgrades during  or continuing to fight problems that have spilled over into in either event  our sales partners have reported that many potential avt customers have delayed new purchase decisions until their schedules allow them to take on new products 
as a result  our channel partners have reported that their new sales pipelines were at unusually low levels in january and february of gross profit years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in  as compared to in  due primarily to the continuing sales shift to the higher margin enterprise fax products and advanced cti applications 
years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in  as compared to in  due primarily to the favorable sales mix of enterprise fax products and advanced cti applications and the declining sales of basic messaging systems 
research and development years ended december  and research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  due to increased personnel costs relating to continuing development projects 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented in  as compared to in years ended december  and research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased personnel costs relating to acceleration of certain development projects  and a full year of research and development expenses associated with commercepath 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented in  as compared to in selling  general and administrative years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased personnel related costs of domestic and international development of both the telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included amortization of million of goodwill relating to acquisitions compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in both and years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to the inclusion of commercepath expenses for the entire year as well as increased personnel related costs of domestic and international development of both the telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included amortization of million of goodwill relating to acquisitions compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in  as compared to in non recurring charges in the fourth quarter of the company consolidated its rightfax and commercepath divisions into the document exchange software group 
as a result of this consolidation the company incurred expenses of  during the quarter of which  was a non cash charge related to stock compensation 
on april  the company merged with mediatel corporation in a tax free  stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
the combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests and all amounts have been adjusted to reflect this transaction 
related to this merger  the company incurred merger related expenses of million during the second quarter of in february  the company withdrew a follow on stock offering originally filed in october and wrote off the costs of  in connection with the canceled offering 
in connection with the acquisitions of telcom technologies and commercepath  the company recognized nonrecurring charges of million and million in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  for the write off of purchased  in process research and development 
other income  net for the years ended december   and  other income increased from million in to million in and million in due to increased interest income from increasing cash and investment balances 
income tax expense the effective income tax rates excluding acquisition related charges in  and were  and respectively 
the acquisitions of telcom technologies and commercepath in were taxable transactions  and  therefore  the resulting excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired is deductible for income tax purposes 
primarily as a result of the tax treatment of these acquisitions  the company recognized an income tax expense of million in  million in and million in net income and net income per share net income was million in as compared to million in excluding the nonrecurring charges related to the merger with mediatel in and the cancellation of the follow on stock offering in  net income would have increased to million compared to the net income excluding non recurring charges of million

per share in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december  from million at december  and from million at december   due primarily from operations 
cash flow generated from operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases resulted primarily from increasingly profitable operations 
proceeds from the sale of stock options also contributed million 
in january  the company acquired rightfax for million in cash plus  shares of common stock 
the business combination was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the purchase price was recognized as a nonrecurring charge in the first quarter of  representing the value of purchased  in process research and development 
the remaining intangible assets are being amortized over seven years from the date of acquisition 
as a result of the earn out and guaranteed value of the stock issued in the acquisition of rightfax  the company made payments in january  and of   and  respectively  and also issued   and  additional shares of common stock  respectively 
this earn out resulted in additional goodwill being recorded in december  and of million  million and million  respectively 
no further earn out amounts are payable 
in january  the company acquired selected assets and liabilities of telcom technologies 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash  plus warrants to purchase  shares of common stock exercisable at per share  which may be exercised any time prior to january  the company accounted for the business combination as a purchase and recognized a nonrecurring charge of million in the first quarter of  representing the value of the purchased  in process research and development 
in october  the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of commercepath from forest city trading group  inc for million in cash 
the company accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and recorded a nonrecurring charge of million for the write off of purchased  in process research and development 
in addition  the company recorded million of goodwill that will be amortized over seven years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on april   the company merged with mediatel corporation 
in connection with the merger the shareholders of mediatel received an aggregate of approximately  shares of the company s common stock  of which were deposited into an escrow account to compensate the company for certain losses that it may incur as a result of breaches of representation and warranties and other agreements by mediatel 
in addition  the company assumed all outstanding options to purchase mediatel shares  which became exercisable for approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
on march  the escrow account was terminated and the shares held therein  less approximately  shares that were returned to the company for losses  were distributed to the former mediatel shareholders 
the mediatel transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of mediatel 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures and  as a result  do not necessarily reflect the cost structure of the newly combined entity 
the historical results do not purport to be indicative of future results 
at december   the company had a million unsecured revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding 
the company s line of credit expires in august  and contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants and restrictions 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or its interbank offering rate plus  at the company s option 
the company invested million  million and million in equipment and leasehold improvements in the years ended december   and  respectively 
equipment purchases in such years consisted primarily of computer hardware and software 
the company expects that its current cash  cash flow from operations and available bank line of credit  will provide sufficient working capital for operations for the foreseeable future 
impact of year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
in order to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  the date code field needed to be expanded to digits 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems were upgraded or replaced in order to comply with these year requirements 
the use of software and computer systems that are not year compliant could result in system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
since january   the company has not experienced any material disruptions as a result of the failure of computer systems or software products to be year compliant 
the company believes it has taken the necessary steps regarding year compliance with respect to matters within its control to ensure that the failure of computer or software products to be year compliant will not materially impact the company in the future 
with respect to internal software and hardware systems  the company reviewed all its material systems to determine which systems were not year compliant 
the company completed all necessary upgrades  modifications and conversions to its programs and equipment to ensure they would be effective in the year all of such upgrades were done as part of a normal upgrade cycle and accordingly no additional costs were incurred as a result of year issues 
the company has tested and will continue to test computer components  including fax and voice cards and software it purchases from third parties  for year compliance 
the company has verified that all such components and software currently in use are year complaint 
the company  however  has identified alternate sources for critical components in the event that a supplier s business is disrupted by year problems that have not yet been identified 
all of the company s products currently available for sale to customers are year compliant 
the company has offered free or reduced cost upgrades to certain purchasers of the company s products that were not year compliant when sold 
to date  the company has incurred costs of developing and providing such upgrades of approximately  the company does not intend to offer upgrades for certain of its older products 
the financial impact to the company of the development and administration of its upgrade programs has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
however  the company is dependent on its customers to take necessary steps  and if any customers have not or do not make necessary modifications  conversions  migrations  or upgrades  it could have a material adverse effect on the company in the form of legal costs or the loss of customers 
the company contacted third parties with which it has material relationships  including its vendors  distributors  banks  and transfer agent  to attempt to determine their preparedness with respect to year issues and to analyze the risks to the company in the event any such third parties experience significant business interruptions as a result of year noncompliance 
the company does not believe such third parties have experienced any materials disruptions as a result of year compliance issues 
notwithstanding the steps we have taken with respect to matters within our control to ensure that our business would not be directly impacted in a material way by the failure of computer systems and software products to be year compliant  we believe that our sales for the first quarter of have been indirectly affected by the year issue 
we believe that it departments are either recovering from fatigue of implementing year upgrades during  or continuing to fight problems that have spilled over into in either event  our sales partners have reported that many potential avt customers have delayed new purchase decisions until their schedules allow them to take on new products 
as a result  our channel partners have reported that their new sales pipelines were at unusually low levels in january and february of we can not be certain that this indirect impact of the year problem will not continue into future quarters 
the discussion of our efforts and ongoing expectations relating to year compliance include some forward looking statements 
because the extent of existing but undetected year problems is unknown to us  we cannot be certain that we will not incur additional  unanticipated costs  losses or liabilities related to internal or third party year problems 
such costs  losses and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
certain trends and uncertainties when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors which could affect the company s financial results are described below under risk factors and in item business of this report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events 
risk factors our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
because of these fluctuations  our operating results for a particular quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our stock may decline 
we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful 
numerous factors contribute to the unpredictability of our operating results  including 
the timing of customer orders  
changes in our mix of products and distribution channels  
the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors  
pricing pressures  and 
general economic conditions 
the timing of customer orders can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
historically  we have operated with little or no backlog 
we earn almost all our revenues in each quarter from orders received in that quarter 
we base product development and other operating expenses on our expected revenues 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust our spending in time to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in quarterly revenues 
changes in the mix of products we sell can also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
for example  shifts between fully integrated systems and software kits result in fluctuations in gross margins because fully integrated systems generate higher revenue per unit but have lower margins due to their hardware component 
our operating results may vary by season  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of seasonal factors  and this may cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors for a particular quarter 
specifically  due to typical year end dealer sales patterns and end user buying patterns  net sales in our first quarter  without taking into account the effect of acquisitions  have in the past declined from the fourth quarter of the previous year 
we rely heavily on independent equipment dealers and value added resellers 
a substantial majority of our net sales depends on a network of independent telephone equipment dealers and computer oriented value added resellers 
there is intense competition for the attention of these independent dealers and resellers from our competitors and from providers of other products distributed through these channels 
many of these dealers and resellers do not have the financial resources to withstand a downturn in their businesses 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our network of dealers and resellers in the future 
moreover  our dealers and resellers may not maintain or expand their present level of efforts to sell our products 
if we lose a major dealer or reseller  or if our dealers and resellers lose interest in selling our products  our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
the integration of recent and any future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive 
we frequently evaluate potential acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
since january  we have made three strategic acquisitions 
our recent and any future acquisitions may direct management s attention away from the day to day operations of our business and may pose numerous other risks 
for instance  we may not be able to successfully integrate any technologies  products  personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire 
in making acquisitions  we may need to make dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incur debt  write off purchased  in process research and development and amortize expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our industry 
in our industry  technology and customer demands change rapidly  and we and our competitors frequently introduce new products and features 
to succeed  we must identify  develop and market new products and features that satisfy those changing customer needs and keep pace with those technological developments 
to do this  we must spend substantial funds on product development 
we have already devoted significant resources to technologies that we anticipate will be widely adopted  such as windows nt 
however  we may not be able to develop new products or product enhancements on a timely basis 
even if we do  the market may not accept the new products or product enhancements that we develop 
our market is highly competitive 
the computer telephony market is highly competitive 
moreover  we believe the competitive pressures we face are likely to intensify  particularly as our competitors make new offerings based on the windows nt operating system 
in the telephony oriented market for messaging systems  our principal competitors are independent suppliers such as the octel messaging division of lucent technologies  inc  mitel corporation  active voice corporation  voysys corporation and callware technologies  inc in addition to independent suppliers of computer telephony solutions  we also compete with private branch exchange and key telephone systems manufacturers 
those manufacturers offer integrated voice messaging systems  unified messaging systems and automatic call distribution systems of their own design or under various oem agreements 
competitors in this category include lucent technologies  inc  nortel networks corporation  siemens business communication systems  inc  mitel corporation and nec america  inc 
in the market for lan based facsimile systems  our principal competitors are omtool  ltd  optus software  inc  esker  sa and computer associates international  inc our fax server products also compete with vendors offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions  including operating systems containing facsimile and document transmission features  low end fax modem products  desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products and customized proprietary software solutions 
in the market for production facsimile systems  our principal competitors are biscom  inc  esker  sa and topcall international ag 
in the market for document distribution products  our principal competitors include the xpedite division premiere technologies  inc and other telecommunications providers such as at t corp  mci worldcom  inc and cable wireless  inc further acceptance of open systems architectures and the development of industry standards in the call processing market may eliminate some of the technical barriers to entry  allowing additional competitors to enter the market 
many of our existing competitors have larger customer and installed bases and substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors have a marketing advantage because they can sell their call processing equipment or facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
we expect our competitors will continue to offer improved product technologies and capabilities 
the availability of these products could cause sales of our existing products to decline 
for these reasons  we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our average sales prices have declined for some of our products 
the average sales prices in our basic voice messaging products have declined due to competitive pressures 
in the future  prices may decline in some of our other product lines 
if the average sales prices of our more significant product lines fall  our overall gross margins will likely fall 
to offset and forestall declining average sales prices  we must continue to develop product enhancements and new products with advanced features that are likely to generate higher margin incremental revenue 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or if our products do not achieve significant customer acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 
to succeed  we must adequately protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology  but those measures may be insufficient 
we have one patent in the area of unified messaging  but our competitors may challenge or circumvent the claims in that patent 
our current patent  or any future patents  may never provide us with any competitive advantages 
other measures that we take to protect our proprietary technology may not prevent or deter misappropriation of our technology or the development of technologies with similar characteristics 
moreover  our use of open systems architecture in the design of our products may make it easier for competitors to misappropriate or replicate our designs and developments 
we may face liability for infringement of third party proprietary rights 
historically  competitors in the computer telephony software industry have filed numerous allegations of patent infringement  resulting in considerable litigation 
we have received claims of patent infringement from several parties and will probably receive additional claims in the future 
while none of those claims has led to litigation  they may yet result in litigation 
any litigation  regardless of our success  would probably be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
litigation could also force us to 
stop or delay selling  or using  products that use the challenged intellectual property  
pay damages for infringement  
obtain licenses  which may be unavailable on acceptable terms  or 
redesign products or services that use the infringing technology 
we face risks from expansion of our international operations 
our growth depends in part on continued expansion of our international sales 
international sales generated approximately  and of our net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have spent significant management attention and financial resources on our international operations 
a significant portion of our revenues are subject to the risks associated with international sales  which include 
difficulty adapting products to local languages and telephone system technology  
inability to respond to changes in regulatory requirements  
inability to meet special standards requirements  
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
potentially adverse tax consequences  and 
uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
currently  substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
increases in the value of the dollar against local currency could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to reduced sales or profitability in that country 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non dollar denominated sales and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
we depend on certain key employees 
to succeed  we must attract and retain key personnel in engineering  research and development  marketing  sales  finance and administration 
in particular  we depend to a significant degree on the efforts of our senior management team 
competition for skilled personnel is intense 
the failure to recruit such personnel or the loss of the services of existing key persons in any functional area could adversely affect our current operations and new product development efforts 
we do not maintain material key person life insurance 
we may experience difficulties in managing our growth 
growth in our business has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management and operations 
to succeed  our officers and key employees must manage growth successfully 
we must continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems 
in addition  we must expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may be unable to timely and successfully accomplish these tasks 
we depend on third parties for certain key components of our products 
we use standard computer hardware for our products 
most of the components we use are readily available 
however  only three domestic suppliers can provide voice processing circuit boards in the quantities we need 
in addition  only two domestic suppliers can provide our facsimile processing circuit boards in the quantity we require 
historically  we have relied almost exclusively on dialogic corporation for our voice cards  and on dialogic and brooktrout technologies  inc for our fax cards 
we rely on those suppliers primarily because of volume price discounts and the cost and effort required to develop software for an alternate voice or fax card 
significant delays  interruptions or reductions in our supply of voice or fax cards  or unfavorable changes to price and delivery terms could adversely affect our business 
our stock price may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
the future price of the common stock will fluctuate in response to factors such as 
new product announcements or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  
quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  
announcements of technical innovations  
announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  
changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  and 
general conditions in the computer telephony market 
in addition  the market prices of securities issued by many companies  particularly in high technology industries  are volatile for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of interest bearing securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
because the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  it does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company has assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to the company s international sales operations 
the company has not hedged its translation risk on these currencies as the company has the ability to hold its foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and does not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
