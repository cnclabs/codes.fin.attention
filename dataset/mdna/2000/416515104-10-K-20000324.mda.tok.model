written premiums decreased slightly in compared to solid premium growth in the hartford s small commercial businesses resulted in growth of 
these growth businesses represented of the commercial segment s written premiums in versus in enhanced product offerings  targeted geographic strategies and partnerships with other entities continued to be the primary drivers of these growth businesses 
these increases  however  were more than offset by declines in the middle and large national account businesses primarily due to intense price competition in the casualty lines  where the hartford s disciplined underwriting allowed business to move to other carriers rather than underpricing in order to retain accounts 
underwriting results improved  or combined ratio points  in as compared with this improvement can be attributed to a decline in the loss ratio of points resulting from underwriting initiatives and price increases 
partially offsetting this improvement was an increase in the other underwriting expense ratio due to investments in growth areas  primarily select customer 
in  written premiums decreased slightly compared to small commercial business premiums grew  and the bond and agricultural lines experienced growth 
small commercial businesses represented of the commercial segment s written premiums in versus in however  premium growth in these businesses was more than offset by declines in the middle and large national account businesses due to intense competition 
in  underwriting results decreased  or combined ratio points  compared to increases in property catastrophe losses of  or combined ratio points  were the primary factor in the decline  as catastrophe experience was worse in as compared to the highly favorable experience in in addition  intense price competition in the mid and large sized marketplace resulted in reduced profit margins  as decreases in rate and price  particularly in the workers compensation line  outpaced loss cost savings 
the commercial segment  however  continued to experience the benefit of its extensive cost containment strategies which mitigate the rate and price pressure on underwriting results 
outlook difficult market conditions and intense price competition within many markets of the commercial sector are likely to continue into the foreseeable future despite some favorable trends 
each market within the commercial segment has implemented plans to achieve greater profitability in a marketplace that has experienced relatively flat growth overall 
the segment has undertaken several major strategic actions  with some to be completed in continued pricing and underwriting actions  primarily in the mid to large account marketplace should have a positive impact on overall profitability 
management expects the impacts of these efforts to continue into and beyond 
investments in such areas as technology  product research and development  advertising and staff training have continued  in an effort to heighten brand awareness  increase product offerings  further develop alternative distribution channels and improve productivity 
management believes the results of these and other actions taken may counterbalance the negative external factors in the commercial market and position the commercial segment for improved written premium growth in and beyond  while maintaining core profitability

servicing revenues from aarp s health care options unit declined by in due to revenues related to the transfer of business from the prior carrier in underwriting results decreased by  with a corresponding point increase in the combined ratio  when compared to the decrease in underwriting results and increase in combined ratio resulted primarily from increased claim and claim adjustment expenses 
loss experience in the property line was higher in when compared to due to increases in both frequency and severity of claims 
claim adjustment expenses increased due to investments in claim initiatives for automobile bodily injury  physical damage and property to reduce loss costs in future periods 
catastrophe losses impacted the combined ratio by points in compared to points in written premiums increased  or  in compared with the acquisition of omni accounted for  or  of the written premium increase

a primary driver of this premium growth was the strategic shift from homeowners to automobile coverages  which began in the affinity unit  which was still in a start up phase  experienced growth of  or  in  contributing to the segment s total written premium growth 
underwriting results improved by  with a corresponding point improvement in the combined ratio in compared with the combined ratio decrease resulted from loss cost improvements in automobile and homeowners from expanded cost containment initiatives  effecting the combined ratio by points 
offsetting this improvement were significantly higher property catastrophes in of compared to in  impacting the combined ratio by points  and increased underwriting expenses impacting the combined ratio by points 
property catastrophe and other severe weather related experience were unusually low in the increase in underwriting expenses was primarily from investments in growth initiatives  acquisition costs related to premium growth and from investment in the affinity unit start up organization  partially offset by lower dividends to policyholders 
outlook intense competition and consolidation in the personal market will remain in the foreseeable future 
management anticipates pricing will be moderately positive in versus the reductions that occurred in the last few years 
significant investments in claim initiatives in are expected to favorably impact loss cost trends in and beyond 
management believes the personal segment is positioned for continued written premium growth through multiple distribution channels 
initiatives are being introduced  as a result of research findings  which are expected to attract more aarp members to the program 
in  affinity entered into an agreement with ford to market to its customers 
the hartford expects the ford program to be a major market in the future 
in the independent agency channel  investments in agency interface  new products and agency relations position the hartford for premium growth 
omni will continue to expand into more states and penetrate a broader base of agents 
investments in such areas as advertising  product research and development  agency relations  technology and staff training will continue  in an effort to further heighten brand awareness  increase product offerings  further develop alternative distribution channels  improve productivity and reduce the expense ratio

hartre primarily writes treaty reinsurance through professional reinsurance brokers covering various property  casualty  specialty and marine classes of business 
written premiums decreased  or  in primarily due to an increase in ceded reinsurance premium  principally as a result of cessions under an aggregate stop loss treaty in  and the non recurrence of a significant single finite risk account written in these decreases were partially offset by the first quarter acquisition of renewal rights for the reinsurance business of vesta fire insurance corp  a subsidiary of vesta insurance group inc written premiums increased  or  in primarily due to the acquisition of renewal rights for the reinsurance business of a large italian insurance company and the finite risk account referred to above 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in north american and european premiums caused by rate reductions arising from market conditions and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates on hong kong premiums 
underwriting results for decreased  with a corresponding point increase in the combined ratio from excluding the finite risk account referred to above  which had no significant impact on underwriting results in  the decrease in underwriting results was due primarily to loss development in from business written principally in in certain business classes  partially offset by recoveries under the aggregate stop loss treaty 
underwriting results for decreased  with a corresponding point increase in the combined ratio  from due primarily to the impact of higher net property catastrophe losses of  which were somewhat offset by increased new business premiums in finite casualty which has a lower combined ratio than traditional casualty lines 
outlook the reinsurance market is highly competitive and prices continue to remain relatively soft in most product lines in most parts of the world 
however  some early positive signs appear to be emerging which indicate market pricing may begin to improve in and continue into until market pricing is fully restored to more reasonable levels  hartre remains focused on writing long term profitable business  even at the expense of premium growth 
on a positive note  responsible buyers are looking to establish core relationships with a select group of financially strong reinsurers  which possess specialized product and geographic spread  service capabilities  and expertise 
hartre stands ready to capitalize on its strengths in these areas in view of the changing marketplace

the increase at london edinburgh was due to improved personal lines results  including automobile  offset by higher losses from weather events  losses related to professional liability claims and a lower effective tax rate 
a negative foreign exchange impact of resulted primarily from weakness in the dutch guilder 
outlook the outlook at zwolsche for is for slow written premium growth in property and casualty due to continued soft market conditions 
continued moderate growth is expected for life operations 
growth expectations for life savings and pension products in the netherlands continue to be positive due to their tax advantages and the expected continuation of a favorable interest rate environment 
an impending change in tax laws to be effective in is expected to remove some of the tax advantages currently available to certain life products 
this change will result in a shift of business away from certain life insurance products to asset accumulation products 
the asset management business is expected to benefit from this change 
zwolsche will continue to explore the viability of opportunities in both life and property and casualty business in the netherlands during as the government continues to review moving certain social security programs into the private sector 
in february  zwolsche obtained a bank license to support the growth of the life and asset management business in the netherlands and in  established an insurance company in luxembourg to support the growth of its belgium life operation and to develop a european cross border operation in life and asset accumulation products 
the outlook for hartford seguros is for slower growth in automobile in property and casualty business and significant growth in life savings products due to a recently signed distribution agreement with the largest mutual fund in spain 
management expects that hartford seguros will continue to build on its unique centralized service business model and segmented underwriting and pricing skills 
hartford seguros is reviewing various alternative distribution opportunities and continues to enhance its strategy to grow its life business 
the spanish market is expected to have significant growth opportunities in life and savings products in the years ahead 
the international segment continues to explore acquisition opportunities in western europe  latin america and asia

these operations primarily include first state insurance company  heritage reinsurance company  ltd 
and excess insurance company limited 
the main focus of these operations is the proper disposition of claims  resolving disputes and collecting reinsurance proceeds related largely to business underwritten and reinsured prior to revenues decreased in whereas they were essentially flat in the prior years 
core earnings were reduced by  and in  and  respectively  representing the approximate minority interest in hli s operating results 
for additional information regarding hli s results  see the life section 
excluding minority interest  core earnings increased in over and in over outlook except for the uncertainties related to dispute resolution  reinsurance collection and those discussed in the environmental and asbestos claims section  management does not anticipate the future financial performance of other operations to have a material effect on the future operating results of the company 
reserves the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made by policyholders or against policyholders 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events  and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the uncertainties involved with the reserving process have become increasingly unpredictable due to a number of complex factors including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
the hartford continually reviews its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves as additional experience and other relevant data become available  and reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
adjustments to previously established reserves  if any  will be reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is made 
in the judgment of management  all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
for a discussion of environmental and asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to these reserves  refer to the next section 
in accordance with the insurance laws and regulations under which the life segment operates  life insurance subsidiaries of the hartford establish actuarially determined reserves to meet their obligations on their outstanding life and disability insurance contracts  as well as reserves for their universal life and investment contracts 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on mortality and morbidity tables in general use in the united states  modified to reflect the hartford s experience 
management believes that these reserves  with additions from premiums to be received  and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  will be sufficient to meet the hartford s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
reserves for universal life insurance and investment products represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges 
environmental and asbestos claims the hartford continues to receive claims asserting damages from environmental exposures and for injuries from asbestos and asbestos related products  both of which affect north american property casualty and the other operations segments 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
with regard to these claims  uncertainty exists which impacts the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
the hartford finds that conventional reserving techniques cannot estimate the ultimate cost of these claims because of inadequate development patterns and inconsistent emerging legal doctrine 
for the majority of environmental claims and many types of asbestos claims  unlike any other type of contractual claim  there is almost no agreement or consistent precedent to determine what  if any  coverage exists or which  if any  policy years and insurers or reinsurers may be liable 
further uncertainty arises with environmental claims since claims are often made under policies  the existence of which may be in dispute  the terms of which may have changed over many years  which may or may not provide for legal defense costs  and which may or may not contain environmental exclusion clauses that may be absolute or allow for fortuitous events 
courts in different jurisdictions have reached disparate conclusions on similar issues and in certain situations have broadened the interpretation of policy coverage and liability issues 
in light of the extensive claim settlement process for environmental and asbestos claims  involving comprehensive fact gathering  subject matter expertise and intensive litigation  the hartford established an environmental claims facility in to defend itself aggressively against unwarranted claims and to minimize costs 
within the property and casualty insurance industry in the mid s  progress was made in developing sophisticated  alternative methodologies utilizing company experience and supplemental databases to assess environmental and asbestos liabilities 
consistent with the hartford s practice of using the best techniques to estimate the company s environmental and asbestos exposures  a study was initiated in april the hartford  utilizing internal staff supplemented by outside legal and actuarial consultants  completed the study in october the study included a review of identified environmental and asbestos exposures of north american property casualty  along with the us exposures of the hartford s international segment and exposures of the other operations segment 
the methodology utilized a ground up analysis of policy  site and exposure level data for a representative sample of the hartford s claims 
the results of the evaluation were extrapolated against the balance of the claim population to estimate the company s overall exposure for reported claims 
in addition to estimating liabilities on reported environmental and asbestos claims  the hartford estimated reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
the ibnr reserve was estimated using information on reporting patterns of known insureds  characteristics of insureds such as limits exposed  attachment points and number of coverage years involved  third party costs  and closed claims 
included in the hartford s analysis of environmental and asbestos exposures was a review of applicable reinsurance coverage 
reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the reinsurance coverage that applied to the balance of the reported environmental and asbestos claims and to the ibnr estimates 
an international actuarial firm reviewed the hartford s approach and concluded that the way the company studied its exposures  the thoroughness of its analysis and the way the hartford came to its estimates were reasonable and comprehensive 
upon completion of the study and assessment of the results in october  the hartford determined that its environmental and asbestos reserves should be increased  on an undiscounted basis  by net of reinsurance and net of reinsurance  respectively

the ending liabilities are net of reinsurance on reported and unreported claims of   and  for  and  respectively 
as of december    and  reserves for environmental and asbestos  gross of reinsurance  were  and   and  and  and  respectively 
the hartford believes that the environmental and asbestos reserves reported at december  are a reasonable estimate of the ultimate remaining liability for these claims based upon known facts  current assumptions and the hartford s methodologies 
future social  economic  legal or legislative developments may alter the original intent of policies and the scope of coverage 
the hartford will continue to evaluate new developments and methodologies  as they become available for use in supplementing the company s ongoing analysis and review of its environmental and asbestos exposures 
these future reviews may result in a change in reserves  impacting the hartford s results of operations in the period in which the reserve estimates are changed 
while the effects of future changes in facts  legal and other issues could have a material effect on future results of operations  the hartford does not expect such changes would have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
investments an important element of the financial results of the hartford is return on invested assets 
the hartford s investment portfolios are divided between north american property casualty  life  international and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of each operation s respective liabilities and within established risk parameters 
for a further discussion on the hartford s approach to managing risks  see the capital markets risk management section 
the investment portfolios of north american property casualty  life  international and other operations are managed by distinct investment strategy groups 
they are responsible for monitoring and managing the asset liability profile  establishing investment objectives and guidelines  and determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  convexity and other characteristics of the portfolios

separate account products separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder 
separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder 
investment objective varies by fund account type  as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations 
non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable life insurance contracts and coli 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance  and generally include market value adjustment features to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
capital markets risk management the hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset liability management activities 
investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments  while asset liability management is the responsibility of separate and distinct risk management units supporting the property and casualty and life operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in accordance with established company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
the company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and asset liability management risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the ability of an obligor or counterparty to make timely payments of principal and or interest  and market risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  securities prices  market indices  yield curves or currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes 
credit risk the hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and frequent review by the company s finance committee 
the company invests primarily in securities rated investment grade and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower  issuer and counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit assessment and ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular interval 
the company s derivatives counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness  and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to and held by  or on behalf of  the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds 
the hartford is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk of a single issuer 
the following tables identify fixed maturity securities for the property and casualty operations  including international and other operations  and the life operations  including international operations and guaranteed separate accounts  by credit quality 
the ratings referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of a nationally recognized rating organization or  if not rated  assigned based on the company s internal analysis of such securities

the property and casualty operations attempt to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
the property and casualty operations have material exposure to interest rate and equity market risk 
the life operations are responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets to that of policyholder obligations 
the life operations have material market exposure to interest rate risk associated with its fixed maturity portfolios 
the company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits 
upward movement in market interest rates during resulted in a significant decline in the unrealized appreciation of the fixed income security portfolio from  to an unrealized loss position at december  however  the hartford s asset allocation  and therefore its exposure to market risk  has not changed materially from its position at december  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded futures and options  in accordance with company policy and regulatory requirements in order to achieve one of three company approved objectives to hedge risk arising from interest rate  price or currency exchange rate volatility  to manage liquidity  or to control transaction costs 
the company does not make a market or trade derivatives for the express purpose of earning trading profits 
the company uses derivative instruments in its management of market risk consistent with four risk management strategies hedging anticipated transactions  hedging liability instruments  hedging invested assets and hedging portfolios of assets and or liabilities 
for additional information on these strategies along with tables reflecting outstanding derivative instruments  see the property and casualty operations and life operations discussions below 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the company s finance committee 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments for both general and guaranteed separate accounts at december  and  totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within each of the property and casualty and life operations 
property and casualty operations interest rate risk the primary exposure to interest rate risk in the property and casualty operations relates to its fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  interest rate risk exists on debt issued 
derivative instruments are used periodically to manage interest rate risk and as a result  their value will change as market rates change  generally in the opposite direction of the item being hedged 
the total notional amounts of derivatives used for hedging interest rate risk as of december  and  were and  respectively 
the principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  along with the respective weighted average coupons wac by estimated maturity year at december   are reflected in the following table 
comparative totals are included as of december  expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of december  and  and is based primarily on london interbank offered rate libor 
callable bonds and notes are primarily municipal bonds  and are distributed to either call dates or maturity depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed to maturity year based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds contained in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates

equities price risk the property and casualty operations hold a diversified portfolio of investments in equity securities representing firms in various countries  industries and market segments ranging from small market capitalization stocks to standard poor s stocks 
the risk associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from changes in equity prices 
the operations occasionally use equity futures to hedge against a change in value on the anticipated purchase or sale of equity securities 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding derivative instruments hedging equity price risk

life operations interest rate risk the life operations general and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the life operations profitability 
under certain circumstances of interest rate volatility  the life operations could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
for the life operations non guaranteed separate accounts  the company s exposure is not significant as the policyholder assumes substantially all of the investment risk 
the life operations general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade  fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these and the life operations other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines  exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
for further discussion of the company s risk management techniques to manage this market risk  see the asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk discussed below 
as described above  the life operations hold a significant fixed maturity portfolio that includes both fixed and variable rate features

asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk the life operations employ several risk management tools to quantify and manage market risk arising from their investments and interest sensitive liabilities 
for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations  hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks 
as an end user of derivatives  the life operations use a variety of derivatives  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options  in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities 
notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion at december  billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
at december   notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
the strategies described below are used to manage the aforementioned risks 
anticipatory hedging for certain liabilities  life operations commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit 
anticipatory hedges are executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset 
these hedges involve taking a long position in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments 
the notional amounts of anticipatory hedges as of december  and were and  respectively 
liability hedging several products obligate the life operations to credit a return to the contractholder which is indexed to a market rate 
to hedge risks associated with these products  the life operation enters into various derivative contracts 
interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
this hedging strategy enables the life operations to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability matching policy 
interest rate swaps are used to convert certain fixed contract rates into floating rates  thereby allowing them to be appropriately matched against floating rate assets 
additionally  interest rate caps are used to hedge against the risk of contractholder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment 
the notional amounts of derivatives used for liability hedging as of december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
asset hedging to meet the various life policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective prudent investment risk diversification  the life operations may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability 
the use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others 
the selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk  the liquidity and efficiency of the market  and the asset and liability characteristics 
the notional amounts of asset hedges as of december  and  were billion and billion  respectively 
portfolio hedging the life operation periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to their corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels 
portfolio hedges reduce the mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates 
the notional amounts of portfolio hedges as of december  and  were billion and billion  respectively 
the following tables provide information as of december  with comparative totals for december  on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies

life insurance liability characteristics life operations insurance liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  are primarily related to accumulation vehicles such as fixed or variable annuities and investment contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
asset accumulation vehicles while interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
fixed rate products in this category require the life operations to pay a fixed rate for a certain period of time 
the cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
contract duration is dependent on the policyholder s choice of guarantee period 
indexed products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the life operations to pay a rate that is determined by an external index 
the amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index 
the primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles  with an additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability 
product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years 
interest credited products in this category credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of the life operations variable annuity products 
liability duration is short to intermediate term 
other insurance products long term pay out liabilities products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and long term disability contracts 
contract duration is generally five to ten years 
short term pay out liabilities these liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year 
the primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows 
liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities 
products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts 
management of the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of the life operations management strategy 
the estimated cash flows of insurance policy liabilities based upon internal actuarial assumptions as of december  are reflected in the table below by expected maturity year

sensitivity to changes in interest rates for liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by the life operations  the sensitivity of the net economic value discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows of those portfolios to basis point shifts in interest rates are shown in the following tables 
these fixed liabilities represented about of the life operations general and guaranteed separate account liabilities at december  and the remaining liabilities generally allow the life operation significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
the fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives and are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques  and evaluated annually consistent with regulatory requirements

some of the repurchased shares were reissued pursuant to certain stock based benefit plans 
unrealized gain loss unrealized gain loss on securities  net of tax  decreased by billion as of december  compared to december  the change resulted primarily from the impact of increased interest rates on the fixed maturity portfolio

the principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford financial services group  inc is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries  enabling it to service debt  pay dividends on its common stock and pay business expenses 
dividends to the hartford financial services group  inc from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
the maximum amount of statutory dividends which may be paid to the hartford financial services group  inc from its insurance subsidiaries in  without prior approval  is billion 
the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions  and to purchase new investments 
in addition  the hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
for a discussion of the company s investment objectives and strategies  see the investments and capital markets risk management sections 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both property and casualty and life companies 
the requirements consist of formulas  which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
rbc is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting  asset  credit and off balance sheet risks 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
as of december   each of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries within north american property casualty and the life segment had more than sufficient capital to meet the naic s rbc requirements 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities  net cash provided by used for investing activities   net cash used for provided by financing activities   cash end of year operating cash flow decreased slightly in compared to the change in both investing and financing cash flows was primarily the result of an increase in disbursements for investment type contracts related to the leveraged coli block of business 
during  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower underwriting cash flows  due in part to higher claim payments on catastrophes  an increase in income taxes paid and timing in the settlement of other receivables and payables 
the decrease in cash used for provided by financing activities was primarily the result of proceeds from the hli offering in may  treasury stock purchases in in accordance with the company s share repurchase program and a decrease in investment type contracts written in the life segment 
the change in cash provided by used for investing activities primarily reflects net investment proceeds used to fund financing activities 
operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
acquisitions on august   hli completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of planco financial services  inc planco and its affiliate  planco  incorporated 
planco  a primary distributor of hli s annuity and investment products  is the nation s largest wholesaler of individual annuities and has played a significant role in hli s growth over the past decade 
as a wholesaler  planco distributes hli s annuity and investment products  including fixed and variable annuities  mutual funds and single premium variable life insurance  as well as providing sales support to registered representatives  financial planners and broker dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the united states 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of planco s operations have been included in the hartford s consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the transaction 
on february   the hartford completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of omni  a holding company of two non standard auto insurance subsidiaries licensed in states and the district of columbia 
the hartford paid cash of per share  plus transaction costs  for a total of the acquisition was reported as a purchase transaction and accordingly  the results of omni s operations have been included in the hartford s consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the transaction 
regulatory matters and contingencies legislative initiatives the business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels 
passage in november of the gramm leach bliley act the financial services modernization act  which permits affiliations among banks  insurance companies and securities firms  may have competitive  operational and other implications for the company 
in particular  the measure includes privacy protections requiring all financial services providers to disclose their privacy policies and restrict the sharing of personal information for marketing purposes 
various states are considering even more restrictive privacy measures that could potentially affect the company s operations 
medical records are also subject to new privacy safeguards under guidelines proposed by the us department of health and human services 
these and similar measures proposed at the state level could affect the company s ability to manage medical claims 
enactment of the financial services modernization act at the federal level has focused renewed attention on state regulation of insurance 
elements of the insurance industry are involved in a countrywide initiative to streamline regulatory procedures  notably the elimination of rate and form filing requirements for property casualty lines 
altogether  about half the states have considered a variety of such measures  which could result in reduced transaction costs and improved speed to market 
current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the life insurance business include tax law changes affecting the tax treatment of life insurance products and its impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles  medical testing for insurability  and proposed legislation to prohibit the use of gender in determining insurance and pension rates and benefits 
in particular  president clinton s federal budget proposal contains certain recommendations for modifying tax rules related to the treatment of coli by contractholders which  if enacted as described  could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales of these products 
the budget proposal also includes provisions which would result in a significant increase in the dac tax on certain of the company s products  apply a tax to the company s policyholder surplus account and increase taxes on property and casualty insurance companies 
it is too early to determine whether these tax proposals  in their current form  will ultimately be enacted by congress 
therefore  the potential impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
congress continues to debate reform of the superfund hazardous waste cleanup program and the creation of a centralized mechanism for handling asbestos injury claims 
both proposals have the potential to reduce claim exposures  however  enactment of such legislation may not occur in the current congress 
pending legislation to end abusive class action lawsuits would also have a beneficial impact  but prospects for near term enactment are likewise uncertain 
so called patient protection legislation introduced in congress and in many states includes provisions permitting lawsuits against health maintenance organizations hmos for denial of coverage 
although the company is not a health care provider  passage of such legislation could affect medical claim costs to the extent that hmos were constrained from aggressively managing care 
insolvency fund in all states  insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund 
in most states  in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state  all members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer 
a particular state s fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged 
assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state 
such assessments paid by the hartford approximated in  in and in naic proposals the naic developed several model laws and regulations  including a model investment law and amendments to the model holding company system regulatory act the holding act amendments 
the model investment law defines the investments  which are permissible for property and casualty and life insurers to hold  and the holding act amendments address the types of activities in which subsidiaries and affiliates may engage 
the naic adopted these models in and  but the laws have not been enacted for insurance companies domiciled in the state of connecticut  such as hartford fire insurance company 
even if enacted in connecticut or other states in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  it is expected that these laws will neither significantly change the hartford s investment strategies nor have any material adverse effect on the hartford s liquidity or financial position 
the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles codification in september the proposed effective date for the statutory accounting guidance is january  it is expected that each of the hartford s domiciliary states will adopt codification and the company will make the necessary changes required for implementation 
the company is in the process of determining the impact  if any  that codification will have on the statutory financial statements of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries 
dependence on certain third party relationships the company distributes its annuity  life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels  including broker dealers  banks  wholesalers  its own internal sales force and other third party organizations 
the company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the company or such third parties 
an interruption in the company s continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the company s ability to market its products 
during the first quarter of  the company modified its existing  exclusive contract with one such third party  putnam mutual funds corp 
putnam to eliminate the exclusivity provision which will allow both parties to pursue new market opportunities 
putnam is contractually obligated to support and service the related annuity in force block of business and to market  support and service new business 
however  there can be no assurance that this contract modification will not adversely impact the company s ability to distribute putnam related products 
year in general the year issue relates to the ability or inability of computer hardware  software and other information technology it systems  as well as non it systems  such as equipment and machinery with imbedded chips and microprocessors  to properly process information and data containing or related to dates beginning with the year and beyond 
the year issue exists because  historically  many it and non it systems that are in use today were developed years ago when a year was identified using a two digit date field rather than a four digit date field 
as information and data containing or related to the century date are introduced to date sensitive systems  these systems may recognize the year as  or not at all  which may result in systems processing information incorrectly 
this  in turn  may significantly and adversely affect the integrity and reliability of information databases of it systems  may cause the malfunctioning of certain non it systems  and may result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to a company 
in addition  year problems that occur with third parties with which a company does business  such as suppliers  computer vendors  distributors and others  may also adversely affect any given company 
the integrity and reliability of the hartford s it systems  as well as the reliability of its non it systems  are integral aspects of the hartford s business 
the hartford issues insurance policies  annuities  mutual funds and other financial products to individual and business customers  nearly all of which contain date sensitive payment dates 
in addition  various it systems support communications and other systems that integrate the hartford s various business segments and field offices  including the hartford s foreign operations 
the hartford also has business relationships with numerous third parties that affect virtually all aspects of the hartford s business  including  without limitation  suppliers  computer hardware and software vendors  insurance agents and brokers  securities broker dealers  banks and other distributors and servicers of financial products  many of which provide date sensitive data to the hartford  and whose operations are important to the hartford s business 
internal and third party year efforts beginning in  the hartford began working on making its it systems year ready  either through installing new programs or replacing systems 
these efforts were completed by the end of  including the internal and external integrated testing of such systems 
in addition  the hartford s year efforts included assessing the potential impact on the hartford of third parties year readiness 
status and contingency plans as of february   the hartford had not experienced any year related business interruptions arising either from its own systems or those of third parties 
however  the hartford has developed certain contingency plans so that if  despite its year efforts  year problems ultimately arise  the impact of such problems may be avoided or minimized 
the contingency planning process involved identifying reasonably likely business disruption scenarios that  if they were to occur  could create significant problems in the critical functions of each business segment 
each business segment has developed plans to respond to such problems so that critical business functions may continue to operate with minimal disruption 
contingency planning also included assessing the dependency of the hartford s critical business on third parties and their year readiness 
these plans were reviewed and simulated on an integrated basis  where appropriate  and will continue to be evaluated 
furthermore  in many contexts  year issues are dynamic  and ongoing assessments of business functions  vulnerabilities and risks must be made 
as such  new contingency plans may be needed in the future and or existing plans may need to be modified as circumstances warrant 
year costs the after tax costs of the hartford s year efforts that were incurred prior to january  were not material to the hartford s financial condition or results of operations 
for the years ended december  and  the after tax costs were approximately and  respectively 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
the hartford does not expect to incur significant costs in related to its year efforts 
insurance claims as an insurer  the hartford has received and expects to receive claims from insureds who have incurred or may incur losses as a result of year issues 
insurance coverage  if any  will depend upon the provisions of the policies and the facts and circumstances of each claim 
the hartford does not currently believe that the claim and claim adjustment expenses related to such claims will have a material impact upon the hartford s financial condition or results of operations 
effect of inflation the rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the hartford during the three most recent fiscal years
