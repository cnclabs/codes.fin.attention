item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements  and the respective notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we have been engaged in the full line distribution of music since and expanded our operations to include the full line distribution of video with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of star video entertainment  l 
p star in may in addition to our core full line distribution business group  we conduct our music and video distribution business through two other business groups  e fulfillment and independent distribution 
our e fulfillment business group provides product  data and direct to consumer fulfillment services for internet retailers and currently represents our fastest growing business group 
we generate most of our revenue from the sale of music and video 
we also receive revenue from providing certain services to customers such as direct to consumer fulfillment and licensing our proprietary databases of product information 
net sales include direct to consumer fulfillment fees  sales of publications  fees for applying retailers customized stickers  fees for preparation of videos for rental and restocking fees 
our direct to consumer fulfillment customers reimburse us for our shipping costs 
returns from our customers and to our suppliers occur in the ordinary course of our business 
accordingly  sales and cost of goods sold are recorded net of estimated returns and allowances 
our fiscal year is a or week period ending on the saturday nearest to march our three most recently completed fiscal years ended april   april  and march  fiscal and each contained a week period while fiscal contained a week period 
the following table sets forth net sales of each of our three principal business groups for fiscal  and intercompany sales consist primarily of sales of music by independent distribution to full line distribution and e fulfillment 
fiscal year dollars in thousands full line distribution    e fulfillment    independent distribution    eliminations    total net sales    the following table sets forth quarterly net sales of each of our three principal groups for fiscal and intercompany sales consist primarily of sales of music by the independent distribution business group to the full line distribution and the e fulfillment business groups 
fiscal fiscal fourth third second first fourth third second first dollars in thousands full line distribution 
        e fulfillment         independent distribution         eliminations         total net sales         represents a week quarter sales increases and decreases through the periods presented have been due primarily to changes in unit volumes sold and to a lesser extent  in fiscal  to lower prices in e fulfillment 
cost of goods sold is comprised almost entirely of the average cost of product purchased 
supplier incentives including cash discounts  returns incentives  rebates and net advertising support  freight expense and inventory carrying costs are included in cost of goods sold  although in the aggregate these items represent a very small portion of total cost of sales 
the mix of product sales among higher margin sales relative to lower margin sales is the most significant factor affecting gross margins 
the video distribution business typically generates lower gross margins than the music business 
factors that can contribute to gross margin fluctuations also include 
the percentage of e fulfillment customers for which we perform direct to consumer fulfillment 
the percentage of lower margin  higher volume hits versus catalog product sold 
competitive pricing conditions 
the level of purchase discounts  rebates and advertising support received from our suppliers 
changes in freight costs our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits 
they also include rent expense  depreciation  amortization  bad debt expense and other items 
such expenses have increased in absolute dollars with our growth in net sales and are expected to continue to do so 
on april   we completed the amplified 
com transaction by which we contributed certain assets used in our music and video e fulfillment business to amplified 
com in exchange for a interest in amplified 
com 
the book value of the assets we contributed to amplified 
com was nominal 
as part of that transaction  amplified 
com will assume exclusive responsibility for providing marketing and sales support services to our e fulfillment customers and for further development of database products assigned to it 
in connection with the transaction  approximately valley employees who formerly provided e fulfillment marketing and sales support or who worked on data products became employees of amplified 
com 
we do not expect the amplified 
com transaction to have significant effects on the financial statement presentation of our business 
sales of our music and video product to e fulfillment customers will continue to be reflected in our net sales 
our marketing and sales costs will be reduced by the costs associated with the former valley employees now employed by amplified 
com  and amplified 
com will absorb costs associated with some e fulfillment development initiatives that it has assumed 
the impact of these savings will be offset by the marketing fees we will pay to amplified 
com  which will reduce our gross margin 
on december   we entered into an agreement with loudeye technologies  inc for loudeye to provide certain services in connection with the creation of a digital music sampling service 
we received  shares of loudeye common stock through a cashless exercise of a warrant that we received in connection with the agreement 
the warrant was valued at  upon receipt and was recorded as an investment in marketable securities 
the conversion of the warrant on march  was based upon the fair market value of loudeye s common stock on that date  which was per share 
no gain was recognized upon conversion 
as of april   the investment in loudeye was recorded at  based upon the closing price of loudeye common stock  which was at such date and an unrealized gain of  net of deferred taxes of  was included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
the value of the investment in loudeye is subject to market fluctuations and is required to be marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  at the end of each quarter 
subsequently  upon sale of the stock  any resulting gain or loss would be realized  and therefore  recognized in earnings for that period 
results of operations the following discussion is based on the historical results of operations for fiscal  and in may  we entered the video distribution business by acquiring substantially all of the assets of star 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of star are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal  and fiscal years net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income net income loss supplemental data ebitda fiscal compared to fiscal the year to year comparison is impacted by the fact that fiscal was a week year and fiscal was a week year 
our net sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal full line distribution sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to a weaker video sell through release schedule and decreased sales to wherehouse entertainment partially offset by increases in dvd sales 
sales to wherehouse entertainment decreased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the completion of our contract to support the transition of blockbuster music stores from viacom entertainment to wherehouse entertainment 
in addition  fiscal included net sales of approximately million related to the blockbuster video release of titanic 
e fulfillment sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to sales growth with existing customers and the addition of new customers 
our top twoe fulfillment customers  amazon 
com and cdnow  accounted for approximately and of oure fulfillment net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
net sales to amazon 
com and cdnow totaled million and million  respectively  during fiscal net sales to amazon 
com and cdnow totaled million and million  respectively  during fiscal independent distribution sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the acquisition of new labels  primarily matador  and growth with existing labels  primarily fantasy 
our gross profit increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  with gross margin remaining consistent at 
gross margins in fiscal were affected by lower prices established under new agreements with our two largest e fulfillment customers and increased inventory carrying costs offset by the reimbursement of freight costs by some of our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from costs associated with the relocation of the wdc and increases in salaries and wages  rent and depreciation and bad debt expense 
salaries and wages related to higher levels of inventory returns processing as well as severance costs are expected to negatively impact our selling  general and administrative expenses in the first half of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily because of higher inventory levels and increased capital investments  which more than offset the borrowing reduction associated with the initial public offering in late fiscal the interest expense associated with carrying our inventory increased substantially as our average inventory position during the year was substantially higher relative to sales than during recent years 
the factors contributing to our excess inventory level included the wdc relocation  slow processing of returns and below forecast sales 
partially offsetting these factors was a reduction of our average interest rate from in fiscal to in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased from a provision of to a benefit of primarily because of the impact of permanent tax differences in a loss year 
net income decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal our net sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal full line distribution sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of extraordinary volume associated with supporting the transition of blockbuster music stores from viacom entertainment to wherehouse entertainment 
in addition  approximately million of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of video sales in fiscal compared to ten months in fiscal as a result of the star acquisition 
finally  the release of the titanic video and growth of dvd sales increased video sales in fiscal net sales of titanic were approximately million in fiscal the balance of the growth was attributable to increased sales to existing and new full line distribution customers 
e fulfillment sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a the addition of amazon 
com as a new customer  b increased sales by our on line customers and c the addition of other new customers 
independent distribution sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a the acquisition of new labels  b increased sales to our full line distribution and e fulfillment business groups and c successful marketing of existing labels and artists 
our gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  with gross margin decreasing from to 
margins decreased primarily because of additional discounts earned by high volume customers and increased inventory carrying costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of sales growth  additional costs associated with the ldc  additional costs associated with a full year of star operations  costs associated with closing certain sales offices and distribution facilities and an increase in our bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal also include the write off of approximately  of offering costs and  associated with the consolidation of certain operations acquired in the star acquisition 
in addition  we incurred a charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for costs associated with the move of our video advertising group from new jersey to california 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales for full line video distribution as compared to full line music distribution as well as our ability to take advantage of our infrastructure investment to grow full line music distribution and e fulfillment sales without the requirement of proportionate increases in our personnel and facilities 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a growth in working capital associated largely with increased sales and opening the ldc  b the star acquisition and c investment in systems and in the ldc 
partially offsetting these factors was a reduction of our average interest rate from in to in our effective tax rate increased from to primarily due to the write off of non deductible offering costs partially offset by the true up of prior year tax returns 
in may  termination fees from refinancing our revolving credit facility resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes 
net income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to working capital 
our working capital needs are seasonal and typically peak in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to increases in inventories purchased for the holiday selling season and extension of credit terms to certain customers 
we maintain significant inventory levels to fulfill our operating commitment to carry a deep catalog of music and video skus 
inventories generally can be returned to suppliers 
historically  we have financed our cash requirements primarily from short term bank borrowings  cash from operations and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease of million in inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of one large customer negotiating to pay on longer terms 
the reductions in accounts payable and inventory were primarily a result of substantial product returns to vendors in the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal consisted primarily of increases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventories 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to increases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventories 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used in fiscal consisted primarily of million for property and equipment acquisitions mostly at the wdc in connection with the relocation 
cash used in fiscal consisted primarily of million for property and equipment acquisitions primarily at the ldc 
cash used in fiscal consisted of million for business and net asset acquisitions  primarily the star acquisition  and million for property and equipment acquisitions 
financing activities provided net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of additional borrowings under our credit facility to fund increased working capital requirements and issuance of long term debt to fund property and equipment acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of additional borrowings under our credit facility to fund increased working capital requirements and the proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of additional borrowings under our previous credit facility to fund the star acquisition and working capital requirements generated by our overall sales growth 
effective february   our credit facility provides for borrowings up to the lesser of million or the amount of collateral availability 
collateral availability is limited to certain percentages of eligible inventory and accounts receivable  and is subject to certain limitations as to video and dna inventories and equipment 
the credit facility bears interest  at our election  at either the prime rate plus a margin of to or the eurodollar rate plus a margin of to  subject to monthly adjustments and certain terms and conditions as stated in the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all eligible accounts receivable  inventory  certain equipment and other intangible property 
the credit facility expires on may  and renews annually thereafter unless notice of termination is given by either party 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including limitations on payment of cash dividends and redemptions 
we are also obligated under several equipment credit agreements 
as a result of our substantial leverage  under which we will incur significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited 
accordingly  our ability to compete through expansion  capital improvements and flexibility in response to changing industry conditions may be limited 
our credit agreements contain numerous restrictive covenants  including limitations on our ability to acquire or invest in other businesses and requirements that we comply with certain financial covenants 
from time to time  we have been out of compliance with certain financial covenants under certain credit agreements 
at april   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under equipment note payable agreements 
the lenders waived such non compliance as of april  one of the lenders amended the agreement to eliminate all financial covenants through the end of fiscal the other lender requires a fiscal year end test of the covenant  as such  the next measurement date is march  historically  we have been able to obtain waivers or amendments to our financial covenants from our lenders in order to remain in compliance with all financial covenants  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so for future violations 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the credit agreements or obtain waivers from such obligations  we could trigger an event of default under the credit agreements 
our cash flow and capacity needs change significantly during the year  with the heaviest credit needs and highest capacity requirements typically occurring during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
if we do not have sufficient finances to purchase the inventory required or the distribution capacity to distribute product in a timely and accurate manner during such seasonal peak periods  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we believe that our borrowing availability under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through the next year 
our future operating and capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including growth of the business  additional infrastructure needs  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures and future results of operations 
seasonality in operating results our quarterly net sales and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of seasonal variations in the demand for music and video 
historically  our sales are highest during the third fiscal quarter the holiday season and returns are highest during the fourth fiscal quarter 
due to this seasonality  we typically experience significant changes in cash flows and capacity needs during the year  with the heaviest credit needs and highest capacity requirements typically occurring during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
new accounting standard see notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
factors affecting operating results certain statements contained or incorporated in this report are forward looking statements concerning our operations  economic performance and financial condition 
forward looking statements are included in the discussions about the impact of our transaction with amplified 
com and our ability to obtain sufficient financing 
those forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by conditions in the online retail market for music and video in march  the auditors of one of our two largest customers  internet retailer cdnow  issued a qualified opinion regarding cdnow s ability to continue as a going concern  based on cdnow s inability to state that it has sufficient cash to continue funding its operations through the end of the current calendar year 
at june   our accounts receivable from cdnow was approximately million 
if cdnow is unable to increase its liquidity and is forced to curtail operations  our sales would likely decline 
while we believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  if cdnow were to curtail operations  we cannot be assured that we would not sustain a material loss on then outstanding receivables from cdnow 
many of our other online music and video retailer customers are not operating profitably  and their ability to continue operations will likely depend on their securing additional funding until such time as their operations generate the requisite cash flow 
the funding needed to support these businesses may not be available 
further  some industry observers anticipate that there will be substantial consolidation within many internet retail markets and that many existing retailers will not survive this process 
if many of our online retailer customers do not survive  our operating results and financial condition would likely be adversely affected 
amplified 
com may fail to be economically successful and may impair our e fulfillment sales in connection with our joint formation of amplified 
com  we contributed to the new entity the exclusive right to market our e fulfillment services to online music and video retailers 
most of our e fulfillment marketing team left our employ to become employed by amplified 
com 
we also contributed certain assets used in this business  including proprietary databases that are very important to the delivery of services to online retailers 
amplified 
com will need to secure additional funding to carry out its business plan  and we cannot be assured that this funding can be obtained or that amplified 
com will ever achieve successful operations 
if amplified 
com were to fail for any reason  or were it to operate ineffectively for a meaningful period of time  our e fulfillment business could be materially adversely affected 
our sales could be adversely affected if we lose any of our largest customers if any of our largest customers were to stop or reduce their purchasing from us  our financial results could be adversely affected 
during fiscal  our top four customers accounted for approximately of our net sales and our top two e fulfillment customers accounted for approximately of our e fulfillment net sales 
net sales to amazon 
com and cdnow  the company s two largest customers  totaled million and million  respectively  during fiscal we may be delayed in filling certain key management positions in may  robert cain  then our president  chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors  resigned from his positions with valley 
following mr 
cain s resignation  barnet cohen  valley s founder  and the chairman of the board of directors  was appointed to serve as valley s acting chief executive officer while the board conducts a search for a permanent replacement 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced our intention to hire a new chief financial officer and a new senior vice president  sales and marketing 
we hired a senior vice president of sales and marketing in march  but we have not yet filled the chief financial officer position 
although we intend to fill both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer positions as soon as we are able to identify and hire the appropriate persons  we may be unable to complete this process quickly 
delays in filling these positions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
further  we cannot be assured that the turnover at the senior management level will not lead to additional management changes that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
new delivery technologies could diminish our role in the distribution process music and video are currently marketed and distributed primarily on a physical delivery basis through wholesale and retail distribution 
in the future  if products are marketed  sold and delivered by labels or studios directly to stores or homes through electronic downloading or live streaming  current methods of wholesale and retail distribution could decrease or be eliminated 
microsoft  realnetworks and others offer streaming technology  which allows users to listen to  but not record  music and video 
in addition  digital distribution has begun on the internet utilizing various coding compression technologies that allow downloading and replication of any digital music product 
the major labels and others have announced plans to develop a universal standard for the electronic delivery of music with copyright protection 
if electronic distribution of music or video becomes widespread and displaces significant demand for the formats we sell and we fail to play a significant role in the electronic distribution market  our financial results would be adversely affected 
in addition  cable and satellite television companies and others are beginning to offer movies on a near video on demand or other basis that allows subscribers to order selected videos for in home viewing 
to the extent that these programs achieve a broad level of acceptance  the market for physical video product sold or rented by retailers could decline 
this would reduce our sales of video product 
we may be unable to obtain product from labels or studios the major labels and studios produce most of the music and video product 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities on competitive terms and conditions from each of the major labels and studios as well as from thousands of smaller suppliers 
we do not have long term contracts with any supplier for our full line distribution or e fulfillment business groups 
if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of product from the major labels or studios or a significant number of other suppliers for our full line distribution and e fulfillment operations  our financial results could be adversely affected 
one video supplier  warner home video  has elected to serve the video rental market directly while bypassing all video distributors  including valley  beginning in august our net sales of warner home video rental product was approximately million in fiscal if other suppliers also bypass the distribution segment  our financial results could be adversely affected 
distribution north america maintains contracts with most of the suppliers it represents 
these contracts typically range in length from one to three years 
if distribution north america were unable to maintain its distribution relationship with any of its large suppliers  our financial results would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to compete with other businesses that offer similar products and services the full line distribution of music and video is an intensely competitive business 
we compete with national  regional and local full line distributors  including alliance entertainment corp 
and ingram entertainment 
as a result of such competition  we could experience pricing pressures or lose customers altogether 
either event would adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  the major labels  major studios and independent distribution companies sell substantial amounts of their products directly to retailers 
however  to date they have not focused  to the same extent we have  on fulfilling the needs of smaller independent stores or providing value added services 
if the major labels  major studios or independent distribution companies start providing more responsive service to underserved retail segments or value added services at competitive costs  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we also compete with several vendor managed inventory firms  including two national vendor managed inventory firms that we believe have revenues greater than ours 
from time to time  several of our retail chain customers have chosen to buy a substantial volume of their inventory directly from the major labels and studios that they had previously been purchasing from us 
to the extent that our customers increase their direct purchasing from the major labels and studios or the independent distribution companies  our financial results could be adversely affected 
specifically  valley s largest customer  amazon 
com has increased  and may continue to increase  the proportion of product it buys directly from the labels and studios 
in addition to competition from existing competitors  in the future we could face competition from new competitors that may enter the business 
if new competitors enter the music and video distribution business  our financial results could be adversely affected 
our existing e fulfillment competitors include alliance entertainment corp  baker taylor and ingram entertainment 
other distributors have announced an interest in starting to service the on line market 
in addition  to the extent our internet customers utilize fewer value added services  such as direct to consumer fulfillment and data  our financial results could also be adversely affected 
distribution north america competes with several other independent distribution companies 
some of these competitors conduct distribution operations equal to or larger than distribution north america and others operate in niche markets 
we also compete with several of the major labels own independent distribution groups 
in addition  as a label or artist gains in popularity  distribution north america faces new competition from the major labels to retain distribution rights for that label or artist 
we expect the growth rate of our e fulfillment sales to continue to decline our e fulfillment sales continue to grow at a substantial rate as compared to prior years 
during fiscal  however  the rate of such growth declined as compared to those prior years and we expect the decline in the growth rate of our e fulfillment sales to continue 
we have significantly increased our infrastructure during fiscal  we have significantly increased our investment in infrastructure  primarily due to the relocation of the wdc 
during fiscal  because our sales did not meet expected levels  we were unable to gain the incremental efficiencies we anticipated would result from this increased investment 
thus  because of the increase in fixed costs that resulted from the expansion of our infrastructure  any continuing erosion in sales versus current or expected levels could result in a further increase of our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
tight labor markets reduce our ability to attract an adequate number of employees or force us to increase our compensation levels low unemployment levels in the markets in which we operate impede our ability to attract adequate labor 
the tight labor markets lead to increased personnel expenses with no offsetting gain in productivity 
trends in the video rental market could hurt our sales studios and full line distributors have instituted programs to increase the quantity of copies of popular video rental titles stocked by retailers 
we believe that these programs have accelerated a shift in the market away from independent video rental stores and small chains in favor of the larger chains 
since  in general  full line distributors play a larger role with independent retailers than with the larger chains  we believe that the market may contract for full line distribution of video rental product 
we might have inventory risk due to an inability to return products we bear inventory risk associated with the financial viability of the independent labels and studios from which we purchase product 
if a label or studio cannot provide refunds in cash for the inventory we desire to return  we may be forced to expense such inventory costs 
further  we often experience higher return rates for products of financially troubled labels and studios 
if we fail to manage our inventory to avoid accumulating substantial product that cannot be returned  our financial results could be adversely affected 
our ability to obtain sufficient financing may be limited we have a revolving credit agreement and several equipment credit agreements that are secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of april   borrowings of approximately million and million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and the equipment credit agreements  respectively 
the revolving credit agreement is used for general working capital purposes while the equipment credit agreements provide financing for specific fixed assets 
as a result of our substantial borrowings under which we will incur significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited 
accordingly  our ability to compete through expansion  capital improvements and flexibility in response to changing industry conditions may be limited 
our credit agreements contain numerous restrictive covenants  including limitations on our ability to acquire or invest in other businesses and requirements that we comply with certain financial covenants 
from time to time  we have been out of compliance with certain financial covenants under certain credit agreements 
historically  we have been able to obtain waivers or amendments to our financial covenants from our lenders in order to remain in compliance with all financial covenants  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so for future violations 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the credit agreements or obtain waivers from such obligations  we could trigger an event of default under the credit agreements 
our cash flow and capacity needs change significantly during the year  with the heaviest credit needs and highest capacity requirements typically occurring during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
if we do not have sufficient finances to purchase the inventory required or the distribution capacity to distribute product in a timely and accurate manner during such seasonal peak periods  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we may be liable if our suppliers fail to comply with copyright laws substantially all of the music and video products we sell are subject to copyright laws and licenses that limit the manner and geographic area in which such products may be sold 
any sales of product in violation of such laws and licenses by us could subject us to monetary damages or confiscation of such product 
we distribute thousands of titles from different artists over numerous jurisdictions and rely primarily on our suppliers to ensure that such titles comply with the copyright laws  some of which may be conflicting or not clearly developed 
although we have not experienced a material loss due to copyright violations  we could be damaged in the future by copyright violations 
we may be prevented from distributing music internationally most of the major labels have adopted policies restricting the export of their merchandise by domestic distributors 
however  consistent with industry practice  we distribute music of the major labels internationally 
our international net sales of music for fiscal were approximately million 
we would be adversely affected if a major label enforced any restriction on our ability to sell music outside the united states 
in addition  although our international sales are denominated in dollars  our international sales volume can be adversely affected by appreciation of the dollar relative to foreign currencies 
the fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock we anticipate significant fluctuations in future quarterly sales and operating results due to a number of factors outside our control  including 
seasonal variations in the demand for music and video 
infrequent new releases of extremely popular hit video titles in a given quarter 
the proportions in which retailers buy their music and videos directly from major labels or studios as opposed to through full line distributors 
the percentage of returns in a given quarter 
the general economic condition in the music and video industries due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock may be adversely affected 
in addition to the factors that may affect our operating results  we hold investments in various other companies  one of which is currently a publicly traded company  loudeye  which are subject to market price fluctuations of the underlying stock 
the value of our investment in loudeye is subject to market fluctuations and is required to be marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  at the end of each quarter 
subsequently  upon sale of the stock  any resulting gain or loss would be realized  and therefore  recognized in earnings for that period 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  including i future announcements concerning us or our competitors  ii variations in operating results  iii loss of a key supplier or customer  iv technological innovations such as changes in physical product formats or delivery technologies  v changes in product pricing policies by us  our suppliers or our competitors and vi changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks primarily from changes in us interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on variable rate debt rose percentage points a change from the average interest rate as of april   assuming no change in the company s outstanding balance under the line of credit approximately million as of april   the company s loss before taxes and cash flows from operating activities would increase by approximately million
