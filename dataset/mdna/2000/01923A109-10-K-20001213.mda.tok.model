item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and products with operations in the uk and the uk the company provides the following services and products i patient services  including nursing and para professional services  ii respiratory therapy and home medical equipment  and iii infusion therapy 
the company provides these services and products from the following reportable business segments i uk operations  and ii us hi tech operations 
the company s us operations include the us s second largest commercial provider of nursing and para professional care to the community and uk healthcare institutions  the uk s second largest home respiratory supplier as well as a leading value added medical supplies distributor  all with operations located throughout the uk the company s hi tech operations are concentrated in new jersey and new york 
the company was a provider of specialty mail order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies 
the company provided these services from the reportable business segment of its us mail order operations  through the year ended september   to patients in their home nationwide and in puerto rico 
in september  the company entered into an agreement  which was completed on october   to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its us mail order operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company s uk subsidiaries obtained new financing 
as a result of the provisions of the voting trust as defined and described in liquidity and capital resources the company did not hold a majority interest of the board of directors 
the investors as defined and described in liquidity and capital resources held substantive rights  principally in the form of their ability to approve the annual budget and financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses of cash 
therefore  the company was no longer able to consolidate the uk subsidiaries into its financial statements although it owned of the outstanding shares of the stock of the parent company  uk parent  as of december  therefore  effective with the refinancing  the company began accounting for the investment in uk parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method  retroactive to october  during the second quarter of fiscal  uk parent and tw uk amended their articles of association to give the chairman a company designee the right to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors and certain documents covering the notes as defined and described in liquidity and capital resources were amended to eliminate the requirement that the investors approve the operating budget 
these amendments have enabled the company to consolidate the uk subsidiaries as of january  the company s revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
the following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the company s product lines year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  product line net patient services net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales net infusion services total revenues the increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of nightingale and growth in allied s branch network both organically and through the on going nursing and care agency acquisition program 
the decrease in net respiratory medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is due primarily to a decrease in revenues in the company s us mail order operations due principally to a reduction in the number of patients serviced 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the uk subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended september   the percentage of total revenues would have been as follows net patient services  net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales and net infusion services 
the following table shows the historical payor mix for the company s total revenues for the periods presented year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  payor uk nhs and other uk governmental payors medicare medicaid private payors total revenues the increase in uk nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of nightingale  which derives the majority of its revenues from the nhs  and to the growth in allied s branch network  as described above 
the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenue in the company s us mail order operations 
the company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lessor extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
the increase in uk nhs and other uk governmental payors and private payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the growth in allied s branch network  as described above 
the decrease in medicare and medicaid as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenues in the company s us mail order and hi tech operations  as described above 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors in the us was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future 
the company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service 
the company s gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
the company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
at september  and  the company had  and  respectively of intangible assets primarily goodwill on its balance sheet 
this represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  and of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  amortization of intangibles for the years ended september   and was   and  respectively 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet and future amortization expense 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the uk subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended september   amortization of intangibles would have been  the company amortizes goodwill over periods ranging from ten to forty years based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized 
the company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given  among other factors  the continuing movement of patient care to non institutional settings  expanding demand due to demographic trends  the emphasis of the company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies 
at each balance sheet date  or if a significant adverse change occurs in the company s business  management assesses the carrying amount of enterprise goodwill 
the company measures impairment of goodwill by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows without interest to the carrying amount of goodwill 
this evaluation is done at the reportable business segment level primarily by subsidiary 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the future cash flows  the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off 
the factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results  the effects of any current or proposed changes in third party reimbursement or other governmental regulations  trends and prospects of acquired businesses  as well as the effect of demand  competition  market and other economic factors 
if permanent impairment of goodwill were to be recognized in a future period  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations year ended september  vs 
year ended september  revenues 
total reported revenues for the years ended september  and were  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or 
this decrease relates primarily to the change in accounting for the uk subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of fiscal  and declines in revenue experienced by the mail order operations  due to a reduction in the number of patients serviced 
partly offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the company s uk nursing operations  subsequent to january    as a result of acquisitions including  from nightingale and an increase in the billable hours 
the hi tech operations also experienced an increase in revenues  primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being serviced

the increase in patient services costs is primarily due to the acquisition of nightingale  which has a higher cost of revenue than the historical uk nursing operations 
the increase in respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales costs is principally attributable to higher delivery costs in the uk operations 
the decrease in infusion services costs is due to an increase in volume of higher gross margin infusion therapies in the hi tech operations

in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in the company s us mail order operations due to an overhead reduction program 
overhead costs in the company s us corporate offices also decreased  principally due to headcount reductions 
these decreases were offset by higher levels of overhead in the uk operations  subsequent to january   principally due to its acquisitions 
these decreases were also offset by the net increase in bad debt expense in the company s us mail order operations as a result of valuing accounts receivable to net realizable value  which was offset by declines in revenue resulting in reduced bad debt charges

the company recorded a benefit for income taxes amounting to  or of loss before income taxes  equity income  minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended september  versus  or of loss for the year ended september  the difference between the effective tax rate for fiscal and the statutory tax rate resulted from non deductible expenses  primarily amortization of intangible assets  the legal settlements and foreign capital gains tax on the sale of amcare 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the  of reported net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards  prior to their expiration primarily years or more 
this belief is based upon  among other factors  management s focus on its business realignment activities and current business strategies primarily with respect to its uk operations 
failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
if this were to occur  management is committed to implementing tax planning strategies  such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the company to the extent required if any to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these benefits 
should such strategies be required  they could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the company s interest in the uk operations and repatriation of such proceeds to the us management expects that it is more likely than not that future levels of income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets  as recorded 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced

the uk operations increased principally due to continued expansion  increased billing rates and an increase in the number of patients serviced 
pursuant to the balanced budget act  a reduction in medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a reduction in medicare reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective january  these reductions reduced revenue  increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction as discussed herein
