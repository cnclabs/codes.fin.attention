fin no 
is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  management believes that the impact of implementing fin no 
on the company s financial statements is not anticipated to be material 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended is effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impact of implementing sab on the company s financial statements is still being assessed by management and was unknown at june  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the required date of adoption of sfas no 
for one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the implementing sfas on the company s financial statements is not anticipated to be material  as the company does not currently purchase derivative securities 
impact of year leading up to  and following the transition into calendar year  the company experienced no significant internal year problems with its information technology systems 
externally  certain of the company s imaging customers required temporary and long term remediation to ensure proper function of the company s products 
the costs of both short term and long term remediation efforts have been approximately  and are not expected to increase significantly  excluding costs associated with existing internal personnel 
identix has used existing personnel for the year program and has no plans to add staff specifically for this purpose 
identix has not separately tracked the internal costs associated with the year program 
not withstanding the foregoing  the year problem is pervasive and complex and there are risks that identix has not identified all of the year issues that may affect it and that any remedial efforts it takes will not adequately address any potential year problems 
though the company has experienced no significant year problems to date  there can be no assurance that significant year problems will not develop going forward 
identix s products are used in systems that perform a number of critical functions 
for example  the biometric security products are used to verify individual identity in a number of high risk situations such as prisons and airports 
the biometric security products are also used to protect computer data and to verify commercial transactions  such as the authorization of money transfers by bank personnel 
although identix believes that it should not have liability for a system failure relating to the year  such a failure in these or other critical applications could potentially require identix to expend substantial resources to assist in remedying the failure or result in litigation to ascertain liability or recover costs 
identix believes that this represents the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to the year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash equivalents and lines of credit 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is generally comprised of money market securities that mature within one year 
the company places investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the company is subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  its results of operation or cash flows for its variable rate lines of credit and cash equivalents 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
certain of the company s foreign revenues  cost of revenues and marketing expenses are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations
