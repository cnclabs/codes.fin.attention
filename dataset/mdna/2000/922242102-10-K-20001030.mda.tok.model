accounting for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since its initial public offering  the company has funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations and credit facilities with institutional lenders 
in june  the company completed an initial public stock offering  issuing a total of  new common shares which raised approximately  in proceeds to the company  net of fees and expenses 
a portion of these proceeds was used by the company to pay off borrowings on its line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
the remainder was invested in marketable securities 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a million revolving line of credit  for the issuance of commercial letters of credit 
the agreement  which expires december   is secured by inventory and receivables 
the agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants 
cash and marketable securities available for sale totaled  as of july   compared to  as of july  net working capital as of july  was  compared to  as of july   and the company s current ratio was as of july   compared to as of july  the decreases in working capital and current ratio are primarily due to decreases in cash of approximately  used for the purchase of treasury stock and  used as partial payment for the purchase of a canopy patent during fiscal  as well as due to cash used in and generated from operations and increases and decreases in inventory and increases and collections of accounts receivable  that result in daily fluctuations in short term investments 
the company had long term debt of  as of july   compared to no long term debt as of july   with the increase relating to the acquisition of a canopy patent during fiscal the company had net stockholders equity of  as of july   compared to  as of july   with such decrease due primarily to the purchase of treasury stock and the operating results for the fiscal year ended july   offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to unrealized losses on investments in marketable securities 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact upon the company s costs and prices during the past three fiscal years 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled  compared to  during fiscal the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of a new show booth for approximately  of the fiscal total  approximately  represented machinery and equipment expenditures for computer equipment and  represented production molds compared to  and  respectively  for such expenditures during the prior year 
future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines 
the company also plans to continue to devote resources toward the pursuit and development of new products 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products which would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
the company also is considering expanding international distribution and developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities which management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers has in the last three fiscal years had any significant material and adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in us dollars and payments to suppliers are also made in us dollars 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the value of the dollar will not have an impact upon the company in the future 
additional factors that could affect operating results the following factors  together with other information contained elsewhere herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
reliance on major customers 
in the past three fiscal years  the company has had several customers which accounted for a majority of the company s sales 
as is customary in the industry  the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers 
the loss of  or a reduction in business from  any of its major customers could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because a large percentage of the company s accounts receivables are due from the major customers  the failure of any of them to make timely payments with respect to its account could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
competition from other manufacturers developers of products  price sensitivity of customers 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there are no significant technological or manufacturing barriers to entry for most product categories other than the quik shade r instant canopy and the airzone tm trampoline 
while the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are price  quality of product  brand recognition  accessibility and customer service  the company s primary customers  mass merchandisers  are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  the company must continually monitor and control its costs while refining its products to maintain its market position 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to provide its products at prices which are competitive or that it can continue to design and market products that appeal to consumers even if price competitive 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  smaller retailers may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
the company also competes to a lesser degree with manufacturers of specialty or premium priced products 
the company s primary competitors in the mass market for in line skates include first team sports  inc skate attack  roller derby cas  seneca and certain models from rollerblade  inc blade runner 
in the case of recreational protective equipment  franklin sports is the company s primary competitor in the mass market 
bell sports corp 
bell and bsi and protective technologies  inc pti are the primary competitors in the recreational helmet mass market 
for instant canopies  the company s primary competitors are international e z up  inc and enviroworks  inc 
for trampolines  the company s primary competitors are jumpking  inc and hedstrom 
in addition  the company may compete with its primary customers when such customers directly source products that the company sells 
at present  the company believes that its products in each category  when compared to competitors products of comparable quality  are currently offered at comparable or lower prices than most or all of its competitors 
however there can be no assurance that other companies  whether new enterprises or established members of the retail or sporting goods industries  will not be able to develop products of comparable or higher quality at lower prices  or that the company s price structure will not be affected by future circumstances 
shifting and uncertain consumer demand 
the company must continually anticipate the emergence of  and adapt its products to  the popular demands of consumers 
no assurance can be given  however  that consumer demand for the company s product categories in general or the company s products in particular will continue into the future 
a reduction in the demand for these products could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
government regulations could hurt the company s business 
the consumer retail industry is regulated by many agencies including but not limited to  the consumer product safety commission and the california department of food and agriculture division of measurement standards 
existing legislation or regulation and any new laws or regulations could hurt the company s business 
the nature of any new laws and regulations and the manner in which existing and new laws and regulations may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined 
the enforcement of existing laws and regulations and the adoption of any future laws or regulations might decrease the demand for the company s products  impose taxes or other costly technical requirements or otherwise increase the cost of doing business which could hurt the company s business 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on the company s business 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may negatively affect the company s stock price 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors  not all of which are under the company s control 
some of the factors that could cause the company s revenues and operating results to fluctuate include the following 
inventory returns  
the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  
increasing operating expenses  
changes in the prices for the company s products  
the compensation of the company s sales personnel based on achievement of periodic sales quotas  
fluctuations in the duration of the sales cycle for the company s products  
the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products by the company s competitors or by the company  and 
conditions specific to the consumer retail industries and general economic factors 
it is possible that in some future periods the company s results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could result in a decline in the value of the company s common stock 
reliance on foreign suppliers to source the company s products 
the company s products are primarily sourced from suppliers located in asia with whom the company does not have long term contractual agreements 
if the company were unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers that would allow it to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on acceptable commercial terms  its business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  the company may not be able to obtain its products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in order to sustain its operating margins 
although management presently believes that other suppliers could be obtained in such instances  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in the future 
in addition  purchasing products from foreign suppliers subjects the company to the general risks of doing business abroad 
these risks include potential delays in shipment  work stoppages  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import duties and tariffs  changes in foreign regulations and political instability 
a significant portion of the company s products  including various models of its in line skates  are manufactured in mainland china  which trades with the united states under a normal trade relations ntr trade status 
while the company believes that alternative manufacturing sources could be found  maintaining existing costs will depend upon these products continuing to be treated under ntr tariff rates 
from time to time  the us has threatened to rescind ntr tariff rates and impose trade sanctions on certain goods manufactured in china 
to date  no such sanctions have been imposed that have affected the company or its products  however there can be no assurance with regard to the possible imposition of sanctions in the future 
in addition  economic conditions in asia could have a material and adverse impact upon the company s ability to procure products from suppliers 
the economic and financial difficulties experienced in asia in could  if such crisis reoccurred  cause a delay or inability to procure products from the company s suppliers which could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
however  the company may be able to move production quickly to alternate sources in response to economic or political circumstances that might arise in any particular country 
product liability claims  insurance 
due to the nature of its products  the company is subject to product liability claims  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
coverage is on a claims made basis  and is subject to certain deductibles 
although the company believes that it has adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of business  including product liability insurance with respect to all of its products  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
trademarks and proprietary rights 
there are risks inherent in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  including those associated with patent issues and marketability 
potential liability from patent and other intellectual property infringements can have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the company was named as a defendant in two lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in both lawsuits alleged that certain of the company s products infringed upon patents owned by the plaintiffs 
the company settled these lawsuits in april and may and pursuant to one of the settlement agreements  purchased a patent 
for further details concerning these lawsuits  please see item under part of this report 
with respect to the company s own patents  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  the company considers such proprietary rights as critical to its success  and relies on patent and trademark law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  customers  partners and others to protect its proprietary rights 
the company holds or has pending certain design patents and utility patents and employs various trademarks  trade names  including its own logos  in the packaging and advertising of its products 
the company has registered the variflex r  static r  quik shade r and airzone tm trademarks in the united states  and has secured a worldwide watch to alert the company to any unauthorized use in any other parts of the world 
registration of various other trademarks of the company s products are pending 
effective patent  trademark  service mark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services are made available 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate the company s patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against the company 
the company has been subject to claims and expects to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by the company 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
risks associated with entry into new business areas 
the company may choose to expand its operations by developing and promoting new or complementary products  expanding the breadth and depth of products and services offered or expanding the acquisition of new or complementary businesses  products or technologies  although it has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or investments 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to expand its efforts and operations in a cost effective or timely manner or that any such efforts would increase overall market acceptance 
furthermore  any new business or product line launched by the company that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the company s reputation or its various brand names 
expansion of the company s operations in this manner would also require significant additional development and operations expenses and would strain the company s management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of market acceptance of such efforts or the company s inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded businesses or products to offset their cost could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of its senior management and other key personnel  particularly raymond jay h 
losi ii  who has entered into an employment agreement with the company 
the loss of mr 
losi ii could have a material and adverse effect on the company 
although the company carries a  life insurance policy on mr 
losi ii  no assurance can be given that the proceeds will be sufficient to protect against such a loss 
the company s performance also depends on the company s ability to retain and motivate its other officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 
other than the aforementioned exceptions  the company has long term employment agreements with only a few of its key personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
the failure to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
consumer regulation of company products 
certain of the company s products are subject to regulation by the federal consumer products safety commission the cpsc  and may therefore be subject to recall request by the cpsc 
in october  the company announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its x games helmets which did not comply with all applicable cpsc standards 
in fiscal  the company recorded an estimated product recall charge relating to these helmets 
although the company is not aware of any current proceeding by the cpsc which would result in the recall of the company s products  any such proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations
