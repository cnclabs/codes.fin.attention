all other quarters in the table represent week quarters 
the company may experience variations on a quarterly basis in its results of operations  in response to  among other things 
the timing of company sponsored associate events  
new product introductions  
the opening of new markets  
the timing of holidays  especially in the fourth quarter  which may reduce the amount of time associates spend selling the company s products or recruiting new associates  
the adverse effect of associates or the company s failure  or allegations of their failure  to comply with applicable governmental regulations  
the negative impact of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict the sale of certain of the company s products

fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
the recruiting and retention of associates  
the integration and operation of new information technology systems  
the inability of the company to introduce new products or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  
availability of raw materials  
general conditions in the nutritional supplement  personal care and weight management industries or the network marketing industry and 
consumer perceptions of the company s products and operations 
because the company s products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  the company is highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality and efficacy of its products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more of the company s products or other products similar to the company s products could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors the company s quarterly revenues  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its revenues in future periods or be able to sustain its level of revenue or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  no assurances can be given that the company s revenue growth rate in new markets where operations have not commenced will follow this pattern 
due to the foregoing factors  the company s future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of the common stock of the company would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth primarily with cash flows from operations

a significant percentage of the company s net sales are generated from the sale of products outside the united states 
the company intends to continue to expand its foreign operations 
the foreign operations of the company expose it to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
in addition  the company s results of operations and the value of its foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings and  accordingly  the comparability of period to period results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
sales outside the united states represented    and of the company s net sales in     and  respectively 
the company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
transaction hedging activities seek to protect operating results and cash flows from the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
the company believes that its current cash balances  the available line of credit and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to cover its needs in the ordinary course of business for the next months 
in the event the company experiences an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
the company may also require or seek additional financing  including through the sale of its equity securities to finance future expansion into new markets  finance capital acquisitions associated with the growth of the company and for other reasons 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into such securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
year issues during  the company s systems that were not year compliant were brought into compliance 
amounts spent on bringing non compliant systems into compliance totaled less than  subsequent to december   the company has not experienced any significant year problems 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance the company will not experience operational difficulties as a result of ongoing year issues  either arising out of internal operations or caused by third party service providers  which individually or collectively could have an adverse impact on business operations and require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its historical operations or profitability 
outlook management believes net sales will increase medium to long term as a result of a value initiative that the company introduced in february the value initiative incorporated the following changes 
reduced prices  on average  by 
reduced the price of the company s top selling product  the essentials  by 
offered a discount for all customers who are active on the company s autoship program  and 
decreased the ratio of sales volume points to the wholesale price of the products 
although it may take some time to generate enough volume to compensate for the new lower prices  management believes the better value  in the form of lower prices  and moving customers to its autoship program  will benefit both the company and its customers as follows 
the company is expected to benefit by improving customer loyalty and retention 

preferred customers will benefit by taking advantage of the company s quality products at the new lower prices 

management believes that associates will have an easier time recruiting preferred customers and other associates at the new lower prices 
additionally  the expected improvements in loyalty and retention should assist the associates with their business opportunity under the company s associate compensation plan 
associate incentives as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline as a result of the decrease in the ratio of sales volume points to wholesale prices 
cost of sales is expected to rise as a percentage of sales proportional to the decline in associate incentives as a result of the new lower prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase substantially in the short term in order to promote and support the company s new value initiative 
as unit volume increases  management believes that selling  general and administrative expenses should decrease as a percentage of sales 
research and development costs are expected to be in line with historical levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts its business in several countries and intends to continue to expand its foreign operations 
the net sales are affected by fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  the operations of the company are exposed to significant risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may favorably or adversely affect the company s reported earnings and  accordingly  the comparability of its period to period results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company sells its products 
when the value of the us dollar is high in comparison with other currencies in which sales are made  this will have a negative impact on net sales 
additionally  if the dollar weakens against currencies in which the company incurs or is required to pay expenses  this will have a negative impact on net sales 
to protect against these risks  the company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
transaction hedging activities seek to protect operating results and cash flows from the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
the company believes that its cash management and investment policies have minimized these risks 
however  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered by the company in connection with its foreign currency transactions 
forward looking statements and certain risks affecting the company the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements regard the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of its existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to the company s past reports filed with the securities and exchange commission means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
the company believes that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include the following the company relies on non employee  independent associates to purchase  market and sell its products 
the company s associates are independent contractors who purchase products directly from the company for their own use or for resale 
associates typically work at the distribution of the company s products on a part time basis and may and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with the company 
the company has a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement its marketing programs and provide motivational support to its associates 
the company undertakes no effort to provide individual training to its associates 
associates may voluntarily terminate their agreements with the company at any time 
there is typically significant turnover in distributors from year to year 
because of this high turnover  the company must continually recruit new associates 
the company s net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent distributors and future growth in sales volume will depend in large part upon the company s success in increasing the number of new associates and improving productivity of its associates 
consequently  the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction and the costs associated with training new associates and other related expenses may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company s ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company  including 
general business and economic conditions  
public perceptions about network marketing programs  
high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  and 
public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care or weight management products generally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in numbers sufficient to sustain the company s future growth or to maintain present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not directly control the independent acts of its associates 
the company s associates are required to sign and adhere to the company s associate application and agreement  which obligates them to abide by usana policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making certain claims regarding the company s products or income potential from the distribution of those products  associates may from time to time create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe the company s marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims or other matters in violation of the company s policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
such violations may result in legal action by regulatory agencies 
future legal actions against associates or others associated with the company could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the company and its network marketing system 
the company takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor associate activities to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of its compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
publicity resulting from such associate activities can also make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation 
network marketing systems such as the company s are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
in the united states  these laws and regulations include the federal and state securities laws  the regulation of the offer and sale of franchises and business opportunities  regulations and statutes administered by the ftc and various state anti pyramid and business opportunity laws that target direct selling businesses that promise quick rewards for little or no effort  require high entry costs  use high pressure recruiting methods or do not involve legitimate products 
similar laws govern the company s activities in foreign countries where it presently has operations or may have operations in the future 
the company is subject to the risk that  in one or more of its present or future markets  its marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure by the company to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further the company may simply be prohibited from distributing its products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries 
the company s business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
the company s ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through its associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding the company or its competitors 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or the company s products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations of the company or its competitors or other network marketing companies and their products  or associate actions 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company relies heavily on its key management personnel 
the company depends on the services of its founder  dr 
wentz  who serves as president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and its other executive officers 
dr 
wentz is a highly visible spokesman for the company and its products  and the company believes its success depends in large part on the continued visibility and reputation of dr 
wentz  which helps distinguish the company from its competitors 
dr 
wentz is not a permanent resident of the united states and will likely spend no more than four months per year in the united states  however he intends to devote a majority of his time to the company s business and expects to travel outside the united states to direct and promote the company s international expansion 
the loss or limitation of dr 
wentz s services as the lead spokesman for the company and its products  as a key developer of those products or as an executive officer of the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s executive officers other than dr 
wentz are primarily responsible for the company s day to day operations  and the company believes its success depends in part on its ability to retain its executive officers and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to its management team 
the company does not maintain a key man life insurance policy on dr 
wentz or any of its other officers  nor does it have an employment agreement with any of its officers other than gilbert a 
fuller  senior vice president and chief financial officer  which expires in may the loss or limitation of the services of any of the company s executive officers or the inability of the company to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ownership of a significant amount of the company s common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control of the company 
gull holdings  ltd  which is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock at january  this ownership percentage may increase as the company completes a public share repurchase program during the current fiscal year 
consequently  dr 
wentz has effective control of the company  including the ability to elect a majority of the board of directors of the company 
similarly  dr 
wentz is in a position to effectively control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws and prevent a takeover of the company by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer his stock to a third party  which could deprive the company s stockholders of a premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of the company 
the products and manufacturing activities of the company are subject to extensive government regulation 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the company s products under the fdc act and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the company s products also are subject to regulation by  among others  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture and the epa 
advertising and other forms of promotion and methods of marketing of the company s products under the ftc act are regulated by the ftc 
various state and local agencies as well as those of each foreign country in which the company distributes products also regulate the manufacture  labeling and advertising of the company s products 
failure of the company to comply with applicable fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any such action by the fda could materially adversely affect the company s ability to successfully market its products 
in addition  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  the company does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any such action by the ftc could materially adversely affect the company s ability to successfully market its products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing its products  the company may be required to obtain approvals  licenses or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
for example  the company s manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and the canadian hpb and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of the company s products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
the company must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies or the countries in which the company s products are sold 
the company cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can it determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on its business in the future 
they could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business expansion into foreign markets is subject to risks 
the company commenced operations in australia and new zealand in february  in the united kingdom in december and in hong kong in november the company believes that its ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on its ability to continue its international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow in its existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis or that new markets will be profitable 
the company must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before it can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which the company s products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  the company may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
the company may be required to reformulate certain of its products before commencing sales in a given country 
once the company has entered a market  it must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully reformulate its products in any of the company s current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals or that it will have sufficient capital to finance its expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  network marketing companies other than the company already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity such as the company  or to make it more difficult for the company to recruit qualified associates 
there can be no assurance that  even if the company is able to commence operations in foreign countries  there will be a sufficiently large population of persons inclined to participate in a network marketing system such as the company s 
the company believes its future success will depend in part on its ability to seamlessly integrate its associate compensation plan across all markets in which the company s products are sold 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
the increase in associate incentives expense reduces profitability 
since its inception  the company generally has experienced increases  as a percentage of net sales  in the amount of incentives  including commissions and leadership bonuses  paid to its associates 
from time to time the company has changed its associate compensation plan to better manage these incentives 
for example  during the third quarter of  the company introduced a broad repricing strategy across its product lines  creating a spread between the price the associate pays for the product and the sales volume point value associated with the product 
at the same time  the company changed its leadership bonus program  increasing the payout from to of total sales volume points 
in february  the company introduced a broad repricing initiative reducing the average price of its products by approximately 
management closely monitors the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may adjust its associate compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that these changes or future changes to the associate compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in maintaining the level of associate incentives expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  these changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated associates 
the company relies on and is subject to risks associated with information technology systems 
the company s success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology 
the company s information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain associate and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports and provide customer service and technical support 
any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company recognizes the need to regularly upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and associate data base 
the company relies on the successful efforts of certain associates 
the company s associate compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
the company believes its revenue is generated by thousands of associates 
however  the loss of a high level sponsoring associate  together with a group of leading associates in that person s downline  or the loss of a significant number of associates for any reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the business of the company is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier and more established competitors 
the company faces intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  weight management items  and other nutritional products 
numerous manufacturers  distributors and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
the company competes directly with other entities that manufacture  market and distribute products in each of its product lines 
the company competes by emphasizing the underlying science  value and high quality of its products as well as the convenience and financial benefits afforded by its network marketing system 
however  many of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition 
the company s markets are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant share of such markets 
the nutritional supplement market in which the company s leading products compete is characterized by 
a large selection of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate  
retail consumer emphasis on value pricing  
constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research  
low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty  rapid change  widely available manufacturing outsourcing  low regulatory requirements  and ready access to large distribution channels  and 
a lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient source  potency  purity  absorption rate and form 
similar factors are also characteristic of products comprising the company s other product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition  personal care and weight management products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution including retail stores 
the company s product offerings in each product category are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other companies 
as a result  the company s ability to remain competitive depends in part upon the successful introduction of new products 
the company is also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention and commitment of new and existing associates 
the company s ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on the company s success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that the company s programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by direct selling tends to be limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although management believes the company offers an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit the company s existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
the company believes that the leading network marketing company in terms of global sales is amway corporation and its affiliates and that avon products is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional products and nutritional direct selling markets include herbalife international  inc  nature s sunshine products  inc  rexall sundown  inc 
and its direct selling division rexall showcase international  inc  twinlab corporation  shaklee corporation and nuskin international  inc the company believes there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that may or will launch direct selling enterprises  which will compete with the company in certain of its product lines and for associates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by this increased competition 
the company s foreign expansion subjects it to the increased expense and risks associated with foreign duties and import restrictions 
at present  most of the company s products are manufactured in the united states and are exported to the countries in which they ultimately are sold 
the countries in which the company operates may impose various legal restrictions on imports 
in most cases  permits or licenses are required to import particular types of goods  including products of the type sold by the company 
duties of varying amounts are imposed based on the values or quantities of the goods imported 
in certain countries and jurisdictions  nutritional and other products are subject to significant import duties 
certain products that the company exports from the united states  notably products in the personal care line are subject to foreign health and safety regulations 
certain nutritional products may also be subject to governmental regulations regarding food and drugs  which regulations may limit the company s ability to sell some of its products in some countries and jurisdictions 
to date  the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining or maintaining import licenses  but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain these licenses or obtain the necessary licenses to enter new markets 
in addition  new regulations may be adopted or any of the existing regulations could be changed at any time in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
duties on imports could be changed in a manner that would be materially adverse to the company s sales and its competitive position compared to locally produced goods 
in addition  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions may prevent the importation of us manufactured products altogether 
foreign operations are affected by taxation and transfer pricing considerations 
the company s principal domicile is the united states  where it is incorporated 
sales in the united states  canada  australia new zealand  the united kingdom and hong kong represented    and of total sales in  respectively 
the company is subject to income taxes at an effective rate of     and in the united states  canada  new zealand  australia  the united kingdom and hong kong  respectively 
under tax treaties  the company is eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for taxes actually paid abroad 
as the company s operations expand outside the united states  taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed amounts of the credits available to the company  resulting in the company s paying a higher overall effective tax rate on its worldwide operations 
the company has adopted transfer pricing agreements with its subsidiaries to regulate intercompany transfers  which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the company for product purchases  management services and contractual obligations such as the payment of associate incentives 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in the company s transfer pricing practices  the company could become subject to higher taxes and its earnings would be adversely affected 
the company believes that it operates in compliance with all applicable foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws  or that such laws will not be modified  which  as a result  may require changes in the company s operating procedures 
foreign operations are affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
sales outside the united states represented    and of the company s net sales in     and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its foreign operations  exposing the company to risks of changes in social  political and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations 
since a significant portion of the company s sales are in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on the company s sales and gross margins 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for the company to establish or continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
as the company s business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of its net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that the company s non us sales and selling  general and administrative expenses be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  the reported net earnings of the company in future periods may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases from the company by its foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  the company s operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and the company may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of such changes on its future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect the company s sales to customers outside the united states 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
the company generally does not use derivative instruments to manage currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will protect operating results and cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
such adverse effects would also adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials 
the company acquires all of its raw materials for the manufacture of its products from third party suppliers 
normally  materials used in manufacturing the company s products are purchased on account or by purchase order 
the company has very few long term agreements for the supply of such materials 
there is a risk that any of the company s suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue selling their products to the company 
although the company believes that it could establish alternate sources for most of its products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
for example  since the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continuing intermittently during and  the company experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of natural vitamin e powder  an ingredient required for the manufacture of several of its products 
as a consequence  the company was required to alter its products and to substitute different products from another source 
in addition  the company relies on third party manufacturers for several of its products  including its food bars and drink mixes 
the company has in the past discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials needed by the company in the quantities requested or at a price the company is willing to pay 
because the company does not control the actual production of these raw materials  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions not within its control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
the inability of the company to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for its products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
the company s products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of the company s products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although the company believes all of its products to be safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
the company conducts research tests the formulation and production of its products  but the company has performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because the company is highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety and quality of its products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  the company could be adversely affected in the event such products should prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of the company s products or similar products 
manufacturers such as the company may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  the company could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation to prosecute such claims 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of such products involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  the company has not been party to any product liability litigation  although certain individuals have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using the company s nutritional products 
these matters historically have been settled to the satisfaction of the company and have not to date resulted in material payments by the company 
the company is aware of no instance in which any of its products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although the company maintains product liability insurance which it believes to be adequate for its needs  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to claims in the future or that its insurance coverage will be adequate or that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
the company s business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
the company owns no patents  has filed no patent applications and does not intend in the immediate future to file a patent application covering any of the formulations of its nutritional or other products 
the labeling regulations governing the company s nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical  if not impossible  given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and interactions among various substances 
in this respect  the company maintains an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer and more effective formulations of its nutritional or other products

in this respect  the company maintains an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer and more effective formulations of its nutritional products 
the company protects its investment in research  as well as the techniques it uses to improve the purity and effectiveness of its products by relying on trade secret laws  although it has not to date entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of its employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  the company endeavors to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for its products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada and many of the other countries in which the company is either presently operating or plans to commence operations in the near future 
the company s research and development efforts may at some future time result in patentable products  in which case patents would be sought  however  no assurance can be given that patents would be obtained 
notwithstanding the company s efforts as described above  there can be no assurance that such efforts to protect its trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against the company for infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
if an infringement claim is asserted  the company may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis or terminate its manufacturing and marketing of its products alleged to have infringed 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurance  however  that third party claims will not in the future adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
the company s results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of its manufacturing facility in salt lake city  utah 
the operation of a nutritional supplement manufacturing facility involves many risks  including power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at the company s facility would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials 
the company s manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by the company and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require the company to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in its processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require the company to halt one or more portions of its operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
