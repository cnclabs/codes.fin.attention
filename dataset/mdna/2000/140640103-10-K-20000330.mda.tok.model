item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview capitol transamerica corporation the company is an insurance holding company operating in states which writes  through its subsidiaries  both property casualty and fidelity surety insurance 
the property casualty segment accounts for approximately of the business written while the fidelity surety segement accounts for approximately of the company s business 
the underwriting cycles of the property casualty insurance industry have been characterized by peak periods of adequate rates  underwriting profits and lower combined ratios  while the downward side of the cycle is characterized by in adequate rates  underwriting losses and  as a result  higher combined ratios 
the adequacy of premium rates is affected primarily by the severity and frequen cy of claims which  in turn  are affected by natural disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions which continue to uphold the deep pocket theory in awarding against insurance companies 
unfortunately for the insurance indus try  the trend of increasing price competition has continued as has the number of significant natural disasters 
this combination has resulted in a consider able reduction in underwriting profitability for the industry as a whole 
adequate premium rates continue to be of concern to the company and the pro perty casualty insurance industry as a whole 
mangement feels strongly that rate regulators have been slow to adjust rates in response to increased claim costs from the factors noted above 
this  when combined with increased competition in the company s niche market  has presented an unprecedented challenge to mange ment 
the company has responded to this challenge with increased marketing ef forts as well as the addition of innovative programs and alliances that should position the company for continued expansion and profitability 
operating results as mentioned in the overview  managment belives that the property casualty in surance industry is in a downward cycle 
however  despite a decrease in premium writings  the company saw a substantial increase in the profitability of its core operations in underwriting income increased to million this year compared to million in and a loss of million in the de crease in premiums written experienced over the past two years was due to a re underwriting of the company s entire book of business 
management is confident that the increased emphasis on prudent underwriting standards as well as aggres sive marketing will assure a continuation of the company s history of substan tial underwriting profits and increasing shareholder value 
gross premiums written during were  compared with  in and  in premiums earned are recognized as net revenues after reduction for reinsurance ceded and after establishment of the provision for the pro rata unearned portion of premiums written 
net premiums earned in totaled  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the net unearn ed premium reserve was   and  at each year end 
gross premiums written    reinsurance ceded    net premiums written    net premiums earned    net unearned premium reserve    the company s underwriting results can be measured by reference to the combined loss and expense ratios 
this tabulation includes the operating results of the two subsidiary insurance companies on a statutory basis 
losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a ratio of net premiums earned  while underwriting expenses are stated as a ratio of net premiums written 
the combined ratios were as follows insurance operating ratios statutory basis losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses combined ratios the re underwriting of the book of business has led to a sharp decline in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
the increase in the underwriting expense ratio is due to a combination of increased marketing costs and a decrease in the denominator of that ratio  which is net premiums written 
the company s combined ratio continues to compare very favorably to the industry average  which was for the first nine months of reinsurance the company follows the customary practice of reinsuring with other companies  ie  ceding a portion of its exposure on the policies it has written 
this pro gram of reinsurance permits the company greater diversification of business and the ability to write larger policies while limiting the extent of its maximum net loss 
it provides protection for the company against unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims could produce a large aggregate loss 
management continually monitors the company s reinsurance program to obtain pro tection that should be adequate to ensure the availability of funds for losses while maintaining future growth 
net investment income and realized gains the company s fixed maturities and equity securities are classified as avail able for sale and are carried at fair value 
the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity portion of the balance sheet 
interest and dividend income interest on fixed maturities is recorded as in come when earned and is adjusted for any amortization of purchase premium or accretion of discount 
dividends on equity securities are recorded as income on ex dividend dates 
investments invested assets    net investment income    percent of return to average carrying value realized gains    change in unrealized gains    the net unrealized loss of  for was comprised of a  unrealized loss on fixed maturities and a  unrealized loss on the company s equity portfolio 
management has begun to increase its tax free bond holdings and de emphasize the equity portfolio  but is optimistic that the recent downturn in the value of its equity investments is temporary and that the current market conditions provide an even greater opportunity to invest and build shareholder value over the long term 
net investment income in amounted to  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the company holds a larger percentage of equity investments than is typical for the property casualty industry  which leads to a comparatively low rate of return on invested assets 
income taxes income tax expense is based on income reported for financial statement purposes and tax laws and rates in effect for the years presented 
deferred federal in come taxes arise from timing differences between the recognition of income de termined for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes 
such timing differences are related principally to the deferral of policy acquisition costs  the recognition of unearned premiums and discounting of claims reserves for tax purposes 
deferred taxes are also provided on unrealized gains and losses 
loss reserves reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the company s best estimate of the liability for the ultimate cost of reported claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims as of the end of each period 
the estimates are based on past claim experience and consider current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions 
the company s reserves for losses and loss ad justment expenses were  as of december  compared to  as of december  this decrease is a combination of giving consideration for the decrease in premium volume as well as the more favorable loss development trend experienced in management continues to closely monitor the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses to assure adequate recognition of the ultimate liability for claims and claim expenses 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to meet obligations as they become due 
the obligations and cash outflow of the company include claim settlements  acquisition and administrative expenses  investment purchases and dividends to shareholders 
in addition to satisfying obligations and cash outflow through premium collections  there is cash inflow obtained from interest and dividend income  maturities and sales of investments 
because cash inflow from premiums is received in advance of cash outflow required to settle claims  the company accumulates funds which it invests pending liquidity requirements 
therefore  investments represent the majority in  in and in of the company s assets 
cash outflow can be unpredictable for two reasons first  a large portion of liabilities representing loss reserves have uncertainty regarding settlement dates  and second  there is potential for losses occurring either individually or in the aggregate 
as a result  the com pany maintains adequate short term investment programs necessary to ensure the availability of funds 
the investment program is structured so that a forced sale liquidation of fixed maturities should not be necessary during the course of ordinary business involvement and activities 
the company has no material capital expenditure commitments 
market risk market risk is defined by the sec as exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity or other price changes 
the com pany does not invest in derivatives or similar financial instrumenmts  which are highly sensitive to market risk and which are the main focus of the new require ments 
however  the requirements are broad enough in scope to encompass the po tential impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s fixed income port folio  as well as the potential impact of a severe drop in the stock market on the company s equity investments 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of the company s fixed income investments bonds and preferred stock by presenting the projected im pact of a parallel rise or decline in interest rates of and basis points
