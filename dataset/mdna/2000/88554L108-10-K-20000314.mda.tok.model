table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we offer advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers  commonly referred to as oems 
we specialize in custom display modules utilizing liquid crystal display  or lcd  components and technology 
our lcd modules have varying levels of integration 
at a minimum  each module includes an lcd  a custom lcd driver  and a flexible connector 
we also provide value added services  which increase our competitiveness  by assembling additional components onto the module based upon the specific needs of the customer 
these additional components include such items as keypads  microphones  speakers  light guides  and optics 
we currently sell substantially all of our lcd modules to major oems 
when we win a design program  our customer typically pays all or a portion of our nonrecurring engineering expenses to defray the costs of custom design  as well as the costs of nonrecurring tooling for custom components 
the typical program life cycle of a custom designed lcd module is three to twelve months and includes technical design  prototyping  pilot manufacturing  and high volume manufacturing 
we typically seek large volume programs from major oems 
the minimum production quantity for an lcd module typically approximates  units per year  although the production rate for some programs has been as high as  units per week 
the selling price of our lcd modules usually ranges between and per unit 
we recognize revenue upon product shipment 
we experienced substantial growth from through  primarily as a result of sales to oems in the wireless communications industry  which grew substantially during that period 
during that period  our primary customer was motorola 
in  our net sales declined  primarily as a result of the phase out by motorola of a significant family of programs 
in  our net sales returned to pre levels primarily as a result of several new programs and customers  including hewlett packard 
motorola accounted for of our net sales in  in  and in in  net sales to motorola increased at a rate faster than net sales to our other customers and represented of our net sales 
hewlett packard accounted for of our net sales in  and less than in and this percentage decrease occurred as several older hewlett packard programs matured and ended 
in addition  new programs launched by hewlett packard in either did not require our lcd modules or required less complex  lower cost modules 
during the past several years  we have experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in our net sales as our oem customers developed retail products with shorter product life cycles and phased out older programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  sales usually peak in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are lower in the following quarter 
several factors impact our gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
currently  significant pricing pressure exists in the lcd module market  especially in higher volume programs in the wireless communications industry 
accordingly  as the production levels of some of our new higher volume programs have increased  the lower standard gross margins on those programs have impacted our overall margins 
we vertically integrate our manufacturing facilities 
in arizona  we own and operate the largest high volume lcd production line in north america 
we generally use the arizona facility for the manufacture of more technologically complex and custom high volume lcds 
we also purchase lcds from asian and european sources to provide us an alternate source and to ensure available capacity 
in order to take advantage of lower labor costs  we ship our lcds to our facilities in manila  the philippines  or beijing  china  for assembly into modules 
historically  we have conducted most of our manufacturing operations at our facility in manila 
at that facility  we assemble lcds into modules and perform certain back end lcd processing operations 
we conduct our operations in manila under an agreement with a third party subcontract manufacturer 
under this agreement  the subcontractor supplies direct labor and incidental services required to manufacture our products 
we also 
table of contents lease our manufacturing facility from the subcontractor 
all indirect manufacturing employees  primarily technicians  supervisors  and engineers  are our employees 
in early  we decided to open a similar display module manufacturing facility in beijing 
within six months  we located a temporary manufacturing facility  equipped the facility  trained our personnel  qualified the facility for customers  and qualified products manufactured at the facility 
as we began manufacturing operations in beijing in the second and third quarters of  however  we incurred costs in advance of the receipt of significant sales 
these incremental beijing based expenses were reflected in our cost of sales 
we began manufacturing in volume in beijing in the fourth quarter of we commenced construction of our permanent beijing facility in late this facility was substantially completed in early july  and we began production in the new manufacturing facility late in the third quarter of all production in beijing during the fourth quarter of was done out of our new permanent facility 
we own our beijing facility through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel and related facility costs 
we make substantially all of our sales directly to oems  and our sales force consists of a small number of direct technical sales persons 
as a result  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense has increased as we have expanded our business and increased our diversification efforts 
in addition  we have recently incurred substantial marketing and administrative expenses in connection with our lcos microdisplay business 
research  development  and engineering expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  design engineers  and other technical personnel  related facility costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research  development  and engineering expense continues to increase as we develop new display products and technologies  especially lcos microdisplays  while we continue with our in house process development efforts related to the high volume lcd manufacturing line located in arizona 
since  we have been working on the development of lcos microdisplays 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with national semiconductor corporation for the development of lcos microdisplay products 
under that alliance  national focused on the silicon technologies needed for microdisplays  and we focused on the liquid crystal technologies 
in  national decided to close its microdisplay business unit 
in connection with that closing  in july  we purchased certain assets and licensed silicon technologies from national relating to lcos microdisplays 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the transaction  which was valued at approximately million 
no additional payments are required under the licenses 
we also hired several key technical employees of national to assist in the implementation of the acquired technologies 
in april  we entered into a strategic relationship with inviso  inc  formerly siliscape  inc  a privately held company with numerous patents and proprietary technology related to microdisplay development 
we acquired a minority equity interest in inviso for approximately million 
as part of this strategic relationship  we provide proprietary manufacturing capabilities and liquid crystal expertise  and inviso provides patented and proprietary technologies and components for the joint development of microdisplay products 
in august  we licensed the microdisplay technology of s vision corporation  which had recently ceased operations 
this license is an irrevocable  royalty free  fully paid up  worldwide license to manufacture and package certain microdisplay products and patented optical engines 
in october  we signed a letter agreement with tecdis spa  a european based lcd company  to form an asic design center in chatillon  italy 
the asic design center will be known as dora and will focus on the design of asics necessary to drive the lcds we and tecdis design for our respective customers 
recently  stmicroelectronics announced its participation in dora and its agreement to manufacture the asics designed by dora 

table of contents these acquisitions  investments  and licenses will result in increased research  development  and engineering expenses as we expand our lcos microdisplay development efforts in preparation for the commercial introduction of lcos microdisplay products 
we are also considering licensing other technologies from other companies that could be optimized on our lcd manufacturing line as well as entering into further alliances 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  especially on our lcos microdisplay technology and related products 
as a result  the actual dollar amount of our research  development  and engineering expenses will continue to increase 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was the result of several new programs  primarily for motorola 
we have experienced a seasonality to our sales  primarily as a result of our lcd modules being used in mobile handsets  the majority of which are sold in the third and fourth quarter of a year 
in  we recorded of our net sales in the third and fourth quarters 
net sales in the fourth quarter of were greater than net sales in the first quarter of cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  this percentage decrease resulted primarily from increased operating efficiencies as a result of a significant increase in production volume 
most of those operating efficiencies occurred in the fourth quarter of in addition  our permanent china manufacturing facility was operational during the entire fourth quarter  and in that new facility we experienced better yields and absorption than when we operated in our temporary china facility 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  the increase in selling  general  and administrative expense reflected the continued expansion of our business 
in particular  we incurred approximately million of marketing and administrative expenditures relating to our lcos microdisplay business in compared to approximately  in research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in the year ended 
table of contents december  compared to in the year ended december  although research  development  and engineering expense associated with in process developments on the lcd line decreased in  research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the development of new display products and technologies 
for example  lcos microdisplays accounted for approximately million of research  development  and engineering expense in compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other expense in the year ended december  was  compared to other expense of  in the year ended december  we had sharply higher interest income in the fourth quarter of as the result of increased cash balances and a tax refund 
that interest income offset interest expense we had in the first three quarters of as a result of additional borrowing incurred in connection with our stock repurchase program and increased borrowings on our working capital line of credit 
all credit lines were paid off and cash balances increased as a result of our equity offering in the third quarter of provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in the year ended december  compared to a provision for income taxes of million in the year ended december  this change resulted primarily from higher pre tax income in compared to the same period in in addition  we recorded tax benefits in the first and fourth quarters of relating to a state income tax refund 
generally  the tax rate was also lower in as a result of higher net income in china which is a low tax rate jurisdiction versus a net loss in china in in  we expect our overall tax rate to be approximately 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in the year ended december  from million  or per diluted share  in the year ended december  excluding lcos microdisplay related expenses  our net income was approximately million  or per diluted share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase resulted from several new programs in for a variety of customers  including motorola 
in  we recorded of our net sales in the third and fourth quarters 
net sales in the fourth quarter of were almost greater than in the first quarter of cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of net sales in from in the corresponding decrease in our gross margin was primarily the result of manufacturing variances occurring as a result of the start up of our new manufacturing facility in beijing  unfavorable manufacturing yields experienced in connection with the start of several new programs  and increased pricing pressure from customers and competitors  partially as a result of the asian economic crisis 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to in selling  general  and administrative expense increased in absolute terms as a result of increased selling expenses and the addition of administrative personnel 
as a result of increased net sales in  however  selling  general  and administrative expense declined slightly as a percent of net sales 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in compared to in in  we continued to expand and intensify our research and development efforts on proprietary display products as well as ongoing lcd manufacturing process improvements  including increased use of the lcd manufacturing line in our arizona facility as a resource for development of these new products 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other expense was  in compared to other income of  in net interest income in was  down from  in the decrease in net interest income was the result of investing lower average cash balances during the year as well as increased interest expense as a result of increased debt 
this decline in net interest income was partially offset by reduced foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to million in our overall tax rate was in compared to in the increased tax rate resulted primarily from losses in beijing for which we did not receive a tax benefit proportionate to our tax rate elsewhere in the world 
net income 
net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  in compared to million  or per diluted share  in quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of net sales

net sales cost and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss historically  we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our net sales 
oem customers that purchase our products for incorporation into retail products  such as mobile handsets  typically increase their purchases during the year end holiday period and phase out old programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  net sales typically peak in the fourth quarter and reach a seasonal low point in the first quarter 
there is significant pricing pressure in higher volume programs in the wireless communications and office automation industries 
in addition  high volume programs that generally have lower gross margins began to represent a larger percentage of net sales in the second half of  thereby reducing gross margin 
in the third quarter of  we also started several new programs and incurred substantial start up costs on those new programs 
in addition  excess inventory purchases occurred in the second quarter of  slowing purchases in the third quarter of and greatly reducing material overhead absorption in that quarter 
in the first quarter of  we had an unfavorable product mix  shipping principally lower margin products 
in addition  reduced manufacturing yields and under absorption of fixed overhead contributed to lower margins 
in the second half of  higher volumes in our manufacturing facilities produced increased operating efficiencies  resulting in better margins 
we started new manufacturing operations in beijing in in a temporary manufacturing facility 
our gross margins in the second and third quarters of were adversely affected by start up costs associated with these operations  which were incurred in advance of the receipt of significant sales 
we moved into our permanent facility in the third quarter of and  as a result  operating efficiencies increased in china in the fourth quarter of in  we continued to expand and intensify our research and development efforts on proprietary display products  such as lcos microdisplays 
other expense increased in the last half of and the first half of as our cash balances declined and we increased our borrowings 
all borrowings were paid off and cash balances increased as a result of our equity offering in the third quarter of as a result  we had sharply higher interest income in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in  we had million in net cash flow from operations compared to nearly flat net cash flow from operations during cash flow from operations improved during primarily as a result of increased net income and depreciation expense 
our depreciation expense was million for as compared with 
table of contents million for this increase relates to increased starts on our lcd line and increased capital equipment as a result of our china operations 
the high volume lcd line is depreciated on a units of production method based on units started 
the increased operational cash flow in was also the result of inventory turns increasing from to in and account receivable dsos day sales outstanding decreasing throughout the year  ending at days on december  our working capital was million at december   up from million at december  our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  the increase in our working capital and current ratio occurred primarily because of our equity offering in the third quarter of  in which we sold million shares of common stock for approximately million  and because of our strong operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of including our cash  cash equivalents  and available credit facilities  we had approximately million in readily available funds at december  compared to million at december  in november  we entered into a million secured credit facility with imperial bank and the national bank of canada 
the credit facility consisted of a million revolving line of credit  which was available for general corporate purposes  and a million term loan facility  which provided available funds to repurchase our common stock 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under that credit facility as a result of our repayment of all outstanding amounts 
in january  we entered into a new credit facility with imperial bank to replace the credit facility 
the new credit facility is a million unsecured revolving line of credit that matures in january mellon bank is a participating lender on that new credit facility 
no borrowings are outstanding under that new credit facility 
advances under the new facility may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate 
our three five systems limited subsidiary has established an annually renewable credit facility with a united kingdom bank in order to fund its working capital requirements 
the credit facility  which expires july   provides  of borrowing capacity secured by accounts receivable of three five systems limited 
no borrowings are outstanding under this facility 
capital expenditures during were approximately million 
these capital expenditures consisted of million for equipment and construction costs relating to our manufacturing facility in beijing  million for manufacturing and office equipment for our operations in manila and arizona  and million for lcos microdisplays  including our purchase of assets and licenses from national semiconductor and s vision 
the assets and licensed silicon technologies from national semiconductor relating to lcos microdisplays were acquired for approximately million in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to depreciable assets  tooling and mask rights  and amortizable licenses 
capital expenditures during were approximately million 
these capital expenditures consisted primarily of manufacturing and office equipment for our operations in manila and arizona and laboratory equipment for research and development 
in addition  we spent million for equipment and construction in related to our beijing operations 
in and  we cumulatively expended approximately million in beijing for manufacturing  equipment  building construction  and land costs 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flows from operations and available and anticipated credit lines will provide adequate sources to fund our operations and planned expenditures through we may have to expand our loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raise capital  however  should we encounter additional cash requirements 
for example  accounts receivable and inventory could rise faster than anticipated if revenue levels increase more than currently anticipated 
in addition  we will continue to seek other alliances or acquisitions and additional relationships with regard to the strategic development of various new technologies  especially lcos microdisplays  that may also require us to make additional capital investments 
we cannot provide assurance that adequate additional loan commitments or alternative methods of financing will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of our operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
we generally sell our products and services and negotiate purchase orders with our foreign suppliers in us dollars 
however  we have certain foreign currency exchange exposure as a result of our manufacturing operations in the philippines and china 
the sub assembly agreement relating to our operations in manila is based on a fixed conversion rate  exposing us to exchange rate fluctuations with the philippine peso 
we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date 
there has been some minor benefit as a result of the peso devaluation  although we are now required to pay approximately one third of any peso devaluation gain to our lessor and direct labor subcontractor in manila 
in china  we have accounts receivable and cash deposits in the local currency 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there has been general speculation since late that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although from time to time we may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has recently imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our business 
year compliance we are heavily dependent upon complex computer software and systems for our operations 
many existing computer programs and systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs and systems were designed and developed without considering the impact of the recent change in the century 
we created a multi functional year task force to resolve any non compliant year systems or processes 
this task force completed the upgrading of computer software and hardware manufacturing equipment during as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any material disruption to our operations as a result of any failure of any of our systems to function properly as of january  we also have not experienced any year failures related to any of our significant vendors or suppliers 
year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
in addition  unforeseen circumstances may arise  and we may not in the future identify equipment or systems that are not year compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in  we incurred interest on loans made under a revolving line of credit at interest rates under a variable interest rate of libor at december  plus basis points 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
in january we replaced the line of credit with a new unsecured credit facility with an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
although most of our business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  certain sales in china are in 
table of contents renminbi 
in addition  we operate high volume manufacturing facilities in manila  the philippines and beijing  china  and a sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities  and some operating supplies 
as a result of these sales and expenses  we do have accounts receivable and cash deposits in local currencies 
we believe  however  that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies other than the chinese renminbi are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although we from time to time may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge
