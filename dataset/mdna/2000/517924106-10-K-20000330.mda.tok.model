item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of lasersight s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and lasersight s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
all references to years are to lasersight s fiscal years ended december   and  unless otherwise indicated 
overview lasersight s net loss and loss attributable to common shareholders for was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  while the net loss for was  and its loss attributable to common stockholders that year was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  the net losses are primarily attributable to the expenses generated by our technology segment 
the difference between the net loss and the loss attributable to common stockholders in resulted from preferred stock dividends  accretion  premiums on repurchases and the conversion discount on preferred stock 
lasersight is principally engaged in the manufacture and supply of narrow beam scanning excimer laser systems  keratomes  keratome blades and other related products used to perform procedures that correct common refractive vision disorders such as nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
since  we have marketed our laser systems commercially in over countries worldwide and currently have an installed base of over scanning laser systems outside the us  including approximately of our laserscan lsx laser systems 
in november  we received fda approval for commercialization of our laserscan lsx laser systems in the us  and shipments of that product in the us are expected to begin within the next week 
our microshape family of keratome products includes our unishaper single use keratome  ultrashaper durable keratome  a control console which may be used interchangeably with our single use and durable keratomes  and our ultraedge keratome blades 
we began commercial shipment of keratome blades in july and of our single use keratomes in december  and anticipate that both of these products will provide us with the opportunity to participate in the significant growth in refractive laser vision correction procedure volume by generating recurring revenue streams 
we currently expect to begin commercial shipments of our ultrashaper durable keratomes during the second quarter of as a result of these significant developments  our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
in particular  we anticipate that our laserscan lsx laser system will make a more significant contribution to our future operating results in the future as a result of the first commercial shipments of these laser systems to us customers within the next week 
in addition  commercial shipment of our unishaper single use keratome products to us and international customers began in december  and we expect to commercially launch our ultrashaper durable keratome in the second quarter of  which we also expect to contribute to our future operating results 
however  we expect to continue to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow at least through the first quarter of we also license to other participants in the excimer laser industry various patents held by lasersight related to the use of excimer lasers to ablate biological tissue  and provide health care and vision care consulting services to hospitals  managed care companies and physicians 
for information regarding our export sales and operating revenues  operating profit loss and identifiable assets by industry segment  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus 
certain pro forma financial information we sold our mec health care  inc and lsia subsidiaries to vision twenty one  inc in a transaction effective as of december  under lasersight s ownership  mec was a vision managed care company which managed vision care programs for health maintenance organizations and other insured enrollees and lsia was a physician practice management company which managed the ophthalmic practice known as the northern new jersey eye institute nnjei under a management services agreement 
the following pro forma information has been prepared assuming that the disposition of both mec and lsia had occurred as of the beginning of the year ended december  the pro forma adjustments serve to eliminate revenues and expenses related to mec and lsia for the periods presented and do not include any overhead allocations 
the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated revenues  gross profit and net loss are not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred had the disposition been consummated as of the beginning of the year ended december   or that which might be attained in the future 
for the year ended december  unaudited pro forma adjustments historical mec lsia pro forma revenues  net     gross profit     net loss     results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales  and the percentage change in such items from the comparable prior year period 
any trends illustrated in the following table are not necessarily indicative of future results

as a percentage of net revenues  the gross profit for refractive products only for each of the three years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
as a percentage of refractive product net revenues  research  development and regulatory expenses for each of the three years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
as a percentage of refractive product net revenues  selling related expenses for each of the three years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in during the year ended december   refractive products revenues increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this revenue increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our higher priced laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
during the year ended december   excimer laser system sales accounted for approximately million in revenues compared to million in revenues over the same period in during the year ended december  and  respectively  laserscan lsx system sales accounted for and  respectively  of total excimer laser system sales 
during the year ended december   laser systems were sold compared to system sales over the comparable period in the systems sold during include system sales to new customers and laserscan lsx excimer laser systems sold to existing customers to replace older laser systems 
the replacement systems were sold at discounted prices at a positive gross margin  though at a lower gross margin than sales to new customers 
additional improvements in refractive products related revenues during the year ended december  were attributable to an increase in the level of service contract revenues and increased revenues generated from our aesthetic product line  which was acquired in april these increases were slightly offset by a reduction in revenues generated from miscellaneous part sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues from patent services for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in  due to increased licensing fees 
net revenues from health care services for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or to million from million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a reduction in expenses of approximately million over the year ended december  such revenue and expense reductions are primarily the result of staffing reductions instituted during mid to more closely match the cost structure of this segment with anticipated revenues going forward 
cost of revenues  gross profits 
for the year ended december  and  gross profit margins were and  respectively 
the gross profit margin decrease during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to higher raw material costs relating to the laserscan lsx excimer laser system of million  an increase in manufacturing overhead of million  an increase in our inventory obsolescence reserve of million  and an increase of million in raw materials relating to our aesthetics division  which was acquired in april research  development and regulatory expenses 
research  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in we continued to develop our keratome systems  excimer laser systems and continued to pursue protocols in our effort to attain fda approval for our products 
as a result of a continuation of these efforts plus the anticipated development of new product concepts  we expect research and development expenses during to increase over levels incurred during regulatory expenses are expected to increase as a result of our continued pursuit of fda approval for our pma supplements  protocols added during related to the potential use of our laser systems for treatments utilizing lasik procedures and the possible development of additional pre market approval supplements and future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase was due to an increase in expenses related to our refractive products business of approximately million over the comparable period in these included enhancements to the customer support and training  quality assurance  marketing  software development and engineering departments of million  million of costs relating to our efforts to develop a blade manufacturing operation  million of higher depreciation and lease costs including the second winter park  florida facility and larger office space  million of salaries primarily resulting from staffing additions to accounting  information systems and human resources departments and bad debt expense of million  which represented a general increase in reserves 
see risk factors financial and liquidity risks if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
the total increase was partially offset by a million reduction of expenses related to our patent services business from the comparable period in selling related expenses 
selling related expenses consist of those items directly related to sales activities  including commissions on sales  royalty or license fees  warranty expenses  and costs of shipping and installation 
commissions and royalties  in particular  can vary significantly from sale to sale or period to period depending on the location and terms of each sale 
selling related expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in estimated warranty expense being accrued resulting from higher sales and an increase in the per system estimate to provide annual warranty coverage from the comparable period  partially offset by a million decrease in sales commissions  which vary depending on the location of sale 
there were no material changes in the levels of royalty fees  system installation and shipping costs in the comparable periods 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in items directly related to the amortization of intangible assets are acquired technologies  patents  license agreements and goodwill 
loss from operations 
the operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to the operating loss of million for the same period in this increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the increase in other general and administrative expenses related to the sale of our refractive products and the decrease in our gross profit margin  partially offset by an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary 
other income and expense 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period in interest and dividend income was earned from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to interest expense of million for the comparable period in interest expense incurred during the year ended december  related primarily to an adjustment to the fair value of the warrant issued to foothill capital corporation and interest paid on a capital lease obligation during the first half of interest expense incurred during the year ended december  related primarily to the credit facility established with foothill on april  which was repaid in full in june in addition to interest paid on the outstanding note payable balance  interest expense in included the amortization of deferred financing costs  the accretion of the discount on the note payable  and fees associated with amendments to the original loan agreement 
during the year ended december   lasersight recognized gains on the sale of subsidiaries and securities of million resulting from the sale of marketable equity securities which were received in december in exchange for the sale of two health care subsidiaries 
income taxes 
for the year ended december   lasersight had no income tax expense  while income tax expense of million was recognized during the year ended december  the net expense for the year ended december  is primarily the result the payment of japanese taxes in connection with the receipt of million in royalties for the non exclusive license of certain patents  the income from which is deferred for accounting purposes 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million for the comparable period in the increase in net loss for the year ended december  can be attributed to the increase in other general and administrative expenses incurred by our refractive products operations and the decrease in our gross profit margin  partially offset by an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary 
loss attributable to common shareholders 
the loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was impacted by the million premium paid on the repurchase of the remaining shares of series b preferred stock  the accretion of million of financing costs related to such shares  the million value of the conversion discount on the series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock  the impact of the million premium paid on the first quarter repurchase of shares of series b preferred stock and the accretion of million of financing costs related to such shares 
the comparable period in was not impacted by any such adjustments 
loss per share 
the loss per basic and diluted share decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in of the basic and diluted losses per share for the year ended december   was a result of the value of the conversion discount on preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d and accretion and dividend requirements on the series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased primarily due to the exercise of options and warrants and the private placement completed in march year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in primarily as a result of the subsidiaries sold in refractive product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the improvement in refractive product net revenues can be primarily attributed to increased sales of our newer laserscan lsx excimer laser system during at a higher average selling price  resulting in million of the total revenue increase 
the average system selling price increased by approximately from levels 
fifty laser systems  including of our laserscan lsx systems  were sold during compared to laser systems  including nine laserscan lsx systems  which were sold in other contributing factors leading to the increase in refractive product revenues were a million increase in service contract revenues  and a million increase in revenues generated from our aesthetic product line 
patent related revenues also increased by million to million in from million in more than offsetting the increases in refractive product and patent revenues were decreases in health care services revenues  which was attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  these two subsidiaries contributed revenues of million and million  respectively  during the year ended all of our health care services revenue was generated by tfg during net sales for tfg for the year ended decreased by million from the same period in this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a total expense reduction  including cost of services  of million for the year ended such revenue and expense decreases are primarily the result of staffing reductions instituted during to more closely match the cost structure of the health care services segment with anticipated revenues going forward 
cost of revenues  gross profits 
gross profit margins were of net sales in compared to in however  gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the gross profit margin percentage increase was primarily attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  mec and lsia operated at gross margins of and  respectively  for the year ended an additional contributing factor leading to the improvement in the gross profit margin was a higher level of laserscan lsx laser system sales  which generally carry a higher gross margin 
research  development and regulatory expenses 
research  development and regulatory expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase can be primarily attributed to continued development and validation of the keratome product line and the development of a new mobile scanning refractive laser system  partially offset by a decrease in costs relating to the continued development of the laserscan lsx  which was substantially completed during additionally  lasersight incurred minor increases in costs related to the fda regulatory approval process  both for its own scanning laser system and the lasik laser system acquired from dr 
kremer 
in  approximately million was incurred in the development of and clinical and manufacturing validation of the unishaper single use keratome compared to million in during  lasersight began a project to develop a mobile platform for an excimer laser system and incurred approximately million in related costs 
expenses related to the development of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system decreased approximately million from levels to approximately million in as a result of a continuation of the efforts described plus the anticipated development of new product ideas  we expect research and development expense during to remain at levels consistent with those incurred during regulatory expenses may increase as a result of our continued pursuit of fda approval  protocols added during and related to the potential use of our laser systems for lasik and the possible development of additional future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of mec and lsia effective december  mec and lsia incurred million and million  respectively  in other general and administrative costs during additional factors resulting in this decrease were the reduction in the operating costs of tfg of million from levels and the reduction in bad debt expense of million from levels 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses incurred at our refractive product subsidiary of million from levels and by strategic initiatives of lasersight and the development of it products and services 
such strategic initiatives included enhancements to the customer support  quality assurance  marketing  software development and engineering departments of million  million of costs of the aesthetic laser product line acquired in april  million of higher depreciation and lease costs including a larger facility in florida  million of legal expenses  and patent related expenses of million  which were nominal during selling related expenses 
selling related expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of laser system sales with an associated distributor commission of million  a million increase in royalty fees  a million increase in warranty expenses accrued based on more sales of the laserscan lsx  and higher shipping and installation expenses resulting from increased system sales 
amortization of intangibles 
costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of amortization costs relating to patent acquisitions as a result of being the first full year for patents acquired in of million  and a higher level of amortization costs relating to acquired technology as a result of being the first full year that the acquired lasik pma application and keratome license were amortized of million 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in goodwill amortization resulting from the sale of mec and lsia 
loss from operations 
lasersight recognized a loss from operations of million in compared to million in this increase in loss from operations can be attributed primarily to the increases in research  development  regulatory and selling related expenses and the sale of mec and lsia  which generated income from operations of million and million  respectively  during this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the operating loss generated by tfg 
other income and expenses 
interest and dividend income of million was earned in from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
this represents an increase of million from the million of interest and dividend income earned in interest expense incurred during was million and related primarily to the credit facility established with foothill on april   which was repaid in full in june in addition to the interest paid on the outstanding note payable balance  interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  the accretion of the discount on the note payable  and fees associated with amendments to the original loan agreement 
interest expense for was million and related primarily to the credit facility established with foothill and the note payable to the former owners of mec which was repaid in full on april  included in other expense in and are costs of million and million  respectively  related to the settlement of patent and other filed and threatened litigation 
included in other income in and are gains of million and million  respectively  related to the sale mec and lsia 
the total includes  of gain on the sale of vision twenty one  inc stock that was originally received as partial consideration in the sale of mec and lsia 
income taxes 
lasersight recorded an income tax provision of million in compared to million in the provision for income taxes is primarily the result of the payment of japanese taxes in connection with a licensing transaction 
the provision for income taxes primarily result from the gain on the sale of two of our subsidiaries after utilization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 
net loss 
lasersight incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the results are primarily attributable to an increase in operating loss resulting from the sale of mec and lsia in late  losses generated from tfg and higher operating expenses as described above  which were partially offset by increased revenues from the sale of refractive products 
the results are primarily attributable to losses generated from tfg and higher operating expenses described above  which were partially offset by increased revenues from refractive products and mec services 
loss attributable to common shareholders 
during  our loss attributable to common shareholders was impacted by the following events  which occurred in the first and second quarters of premiums of million paid on the repurchase of shares of series b preferred stock  accretion of million of financing costs related to such shares  and the value of the conversion discount on series b preferred stock of  and on series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock of million 
in  the conversion discount on series b preferred stock was  and accretion and dividend requirements totaled million 
loss per share 
loss per basic and diluted common share increased to in from in this increase was attributable to the larger net loss incurred and accretion  dividend requirements  and premiums on the redemption of series b preferred stock 
the basic and diluted losses per share in of were a result of the value of the conversion discount on series b  c and d preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d and accretion  dividend requirements and repurchase premiums on the series b preferred stock 
weighted average shares outstanding increased in primarily as a result of the conversion of shares of series b preferred stock into common stock 
other increases were from acquisition activity and the exercise of options and warrants 
weighted average shares outstanding increased in as a result of the conversion of eight shares of series a preferred stock into common stock  the amendment to the purchase agreement related to lasersight centers  the issuance of shares under the earnout provisions of the acquisition of tfg  the issuance of shares in conjunction with the acquisition of rights to the pma application for the excimer laser and keratome patent  and the exercise of options 
the basic and diluted losses per share in of were a result of the value of the conversion discount on preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d  and accretion and dividend requirements on the series b preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds have historically been from sales of preferred stock and common stock  sales of subsidiaries and patent rights and  to a lesser extent  our operating cash flows 
we issued securities totaling approximately million in  million in  million in and million to date in  and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately  in  million in and million in in addition  we sold subsidiaries and various patent rights  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million in and million in we have principally used these capital resources to fund operating losses  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and retirement of debt 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility with the huntington national bank in june we may borrow amounts under this credit facility at an annual rate equal to above the prime rate for short term working capital needs or for such other purposes as may be approved by huntington 
the credit agreement with huntington expires on june   though we expect to renew it  and requires us to maintain a specified liquidity level and tangible net worth levels 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
operating activities used net cash of million during  compared to million during the year ended december  we expect to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow from operations for the first quarter of there can be no assurance that we can regain or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in any subsequent fiscal period 
net cash used in investing activities of million during can be attributed primarily to the purchase of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash provided from financing activities during of million resulted from the issuance of  shares of common stock and  warrants in a private placement to six investors for gross proceeds of million including million each from tlc and the pequot funds and from the aggregate exercise price of million received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 
our working capital increased million from million at december  to million as of december  this increase in working capital resulted primarily from the march private placement of common stock and warrants for gross proceeds of million and million received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset primarily by cash used in operating activities of million 
on january   we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for proceeds of million including million from tlc 
on february   we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for proceeds of  we believe that the proceeds from these issuances  together with our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next months in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the commercial acceptance of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system  our ultraedge keratome blades and our unishaper single use keratomes  the commercial acceptance of our ultrashaper durable keratome  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
similarly  our long term liquidity will be dependent on the successful entrance into the us market with our laser systems  the successful entrance into us and international markets of our keratome products  and our ability to collect our receivables on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that we will not seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
other than the million credit facility signed in june with the huntington national bank  we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
seasonality  backlog and customer payment terms based on our historical activity  we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations have a material impact on our financial performance 
to date  we have been able to ship laser units as orders are received 
as a result  order backlog is not a meaningful factor in our business 
in the us  we expect that sales of our laser systems will generally be to customers with approved credit  and we anticipate that the purchase price for such laser systems will generally be paid to us within days of installation 
in international markets  unless a letter of credit or other acceptable security has been obtained  we generally require a significant down payment or deposit from our laser system customers at or before installation 
at december   we were the payee on letters of credit with foreign financial institutions aggregating approximately million compared to approximately million at december  
on occasion  it is necessary to meet a competitor s more liberal terms of payment 
in those and other cases  we may provide term financing 
our internally financed sales with repayment periods exceeding months measured from the installation date decreased from systems in  to systems in and consisted of five systems during in our experience  sales of major capital equipment such as excimer laser systems in certain areas  including much of south and central america  often require payment terms ranging from to months 
risk factors and uncertainties the business  results of operations and financial condition of lasersight and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including the ones noted below industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven 
we only recently received the food drug administration approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us and expect our first commercial shipments to customers in the us within the next week 
our previous experience marketing and selling our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us had been limited to cost recovery sales to refractive surgeons participating in our fda clinical trials 
the required level of per procedure fees payable to us by the refractive surgeon may not be accepted by the marketplace or may exceed those charged by our competitors 
while we believe that gaining access to our recently approved scanning narrow beam laser technology justifies the required per procedure fee levels  we cannot assure you that this business model will be accepted by a large number of refractive surgeons 
if our competitors reduce or do not charge per procedure fees to users of their systems  we could be forced to reduce or eliminate the fees charged under this business model  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
for example  nidek co  ltd  one of our competitors  has publicly stated that it does not intend to charge per procedure fees to users of its laser systems in the us and internationally 
successful implementation of this business model is crucial to the commercial launch of our laserscan lsx laser system in the us and may require the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness of the laserscan lsx laser system and create demand by refractive surgeons 
if our laser system fails to achieve market acceptance in the us  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance  and we are significantly dependent upon our marketing alliance with becton dickinson with respect to the sale of our keratome products 
keratomes are surgical devices used to create a corneal flap immediately prior to lasik laser vision correction procedures 
we began to roll out our microshape family of keratome products only recently with the commercial launch of our ultraedge keratome blades in july and of our unishaper single use keratomes and control consoles in december we anticipate the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratomes during the second quarter of we cannot provide any assurances that there will not be unanticipated delays in the launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome 
our unishaper single use keratome is the first disposable keratome product to be commercially marketed  and we cannot assure you that refractive surgeons  including in particular refractive surgeons who perform a large volume of lasik procedures  will accept our unishaper product as either a replacement for or a supplement to the durable keratomes traditionally used to create corneal flaps 
our ultrashaper durable keratome incorporates the features found in the automated corneal shaper keratome previously marketed by bausch lomb with new enhancements and features 
however  bausch lomb has not aggressively marketed or serviced the acs since when we licensed the rights to commercially market keratomes based on the same technology  and has successfully transitioned a large number of refractive surgeons from the acs to its hansatome durable keratome product 
we believe that many refractive surgeons learned to perform the lasik procedure using the acs and prefer the surgical technique required by the acs  which is also used to operate our ultrashaper durable keratome  to that required to operate the hansatome keratome product 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving broad market acceptance of our ultrashaper durable keratome or our other keratome products 
successful implementation of our keratome product sales strategy is significantly dependent upon our marketing and distribution alliance with becton dickinson 
pursuant to our october agreement  becton dickinson is  subject to limited exceptions  the exclusive distributor of our keratomes and keratome related products in the us  the us  ireland and japan  and has a non exclusive right to distribute kits including keratome products in other countries 
while our agreement with becton dickinson has a five year term  it is subject to early termination in certain circumstances  including the failure of becton dickinson to achieve minimum sales levels 
if we cannot successfully market and sell our keratome products or if our marketing and distribution alliance with becton dickinson fails to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome product 
the vision correction industry currently consists of a few established providers with significant market shares and we may encounter difficulties competing in this highly competitive environment 
the vision correction industry is subject to intense  increasing competition  and we do not know if we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
many of our competitors have established products  distribution capabilities and customer service networks in the us marketplace  are substantially larger and have greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than we do 
visx  incorporated  the current industry leader for excimer laser system sales in the us  sold laser systems which performed a significant majority of the laser vision correction procedures performed in the us in and similarly  bausch lomb sold a significant majority of the keratomes used by refractive surgeons in the us in and two of our other competitors  summit technology  inc and autonomous technology corporation merged in april the merger resulted in a combined entity with enhanced market presence  technology base and distribution capabilities and provided summit with a narrow beam laser technology platform which will enable summit to compete more directly with our narrow beam laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
in addition  as a result of the merger  the combined entity will be able to sell narrow beam laser systems under a royalty free license to certain visx patents without incurring the expense and uncertainty associated with intellectual property litigation with visx 
many of our competitors received earlier regulatory approvals than us and may have a competitive advantage over us due to the subsequent expansion of their regulatory approvals and their substantial experience in the us market 
we received the fda approval necessary for the commercial sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us in november  and expect our first commercial shipments to customers in the us to occur within the next week 
our direct competitors include large corporations such as visx and summit  each of whom received fda approval of excimer laser systems more than three years ago and has substantial experience manufacturing  marketing and servicing laser systems in the us in addition to visx  summit  and nidek  bausch lomb recently obtained fda approval for their laser system 
in the us  a manufacturer of excimer laser vision correction systems gains a competitive advantage by having its systems approved by the fda for a wider range of treatments 
initial fda approvals of excimer laser vision correction systems historically have been limited to prk treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness  with additional approvals for other and broader treatments granted only as a result of subsequent fda applications and clinical trials 
our laserscan lsx is currently approved only for the prk treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness up to diopters without astigmatism using a pulse repetition rate of hz  and its use for the treatment of higher levels of nearsightedness up to diopters is allowed only if the refractive surgeon deems it to be reasonable 
currently  excimer laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx  summit and nidek have been approved for higher levels of nearsightedness than the laserscan lsx and are also approved for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism for which the laserscan lsx currently does not have approval 
the visx excimer laser system is also approved for the treatment of moderate farsightedness 
on march   the fda ophthalmic advisory panel recommended approval for summit s ladarvision system for farsightedness of up to diopters and an astigmatism range of up to diopters 
although we have submitted applications to the fda for approval for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism and we expect to file a pma supplement in the near future which would permit our laser systems sold to customers in the us to operate at a hz pulse rate  if the fda does not approve our pending and expected applications in a timely manner or at all  our ability to compete effectively in the us may be severely impaired 
summit s apex plus excimer laser workstation recently received fda approval for the lasik treatment of myopia nearsightedness with or without astigmatism 
the approval is for the correction of myopia in the range of d to d with or without astigmatism in the range of d to d 
the summit laser system is currently the only laser system commercially available in the us with fda approval for use in lasik 
laser systems manufactured by other companies approved by fda for prk  including visx  nidek  and lasersight  are routinely used off label to perform lasik 
a physician may decide  as part of the practice of medicine  to use a medical device outside of its fda approved indications for an unapproved or off label use 
prior to summit s approval  all lasik procedures performed in the us with commercially available lasers were performed as the practice of medicine 
summit s receipt of lasik specific fda regulatory approval could be a significant competitive advantage which could impede our ability to successfully introduce our laserscan lsx system in the us or discourage physicians from using our or other manufacturers lasers off label 
our failure to successfully effect our product introduction in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our principal competitors in the keratome business  including current market leader bausch lomb  received fda clearance prior to the commercialization of our keratome products and have substantial experience marketing their keratome products 
the established market presence in the us of previously approved laser systems and keratome products  as well as the entry of new competitors into the market upon receipt of new or expanded regulatory approvals  could impede our ability to successfully introduce our laserscan lsx system in the us and our keratome products worldwide and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we believe that our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships will have a significant impact on our ability to meet our business objectives 
these strategic relationships are critical to our future success because we believe that these relationships will help us to o extend the reach of our products to a larger number of refractive surgeons  o develop and deploy new products  o further enhance the lasersight brand  and o generate additional revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in our industry if they have relationships with our competitors  or if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  some potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships are in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance as to the terms  timing or consummation of any future strategic relationships 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 
because the sale of our products is dependent on the continued market acceptance of laser based refractive eye surgery using the lasik procedure  the lack of broad market acceptance would hurt our business 
we believe that whether we achieve profitability and growth will depend  in part  upon the continued acceptance of laser vision correction using the lasik procedure in the us and other countries 
we cannot be certain that laser vision correction will continue to be accepted by either the refractive surgeons or the public at large as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
the acceptance of laser vision correction and  specifically  the lasik procedure may be adversely affected by o possible concerns relating to safety and efficacy  including the predictability and stability of results  o the public s general resistance to surgery  o the effectiveness and lower cost of alternative methods of correcting refractive vision disorders  o the lack of long term follow up data  o the possibility of unknown side effects  o the lack of third party reimbursement for the procedures  o the cost of the procedure  and o possible future unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from the use of laser vision correction 
unfavorable side effects and potential complications which may result from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by any manufacturer may broadly affect market acceptance of laser based vision correction surgery 
potential patients may not distinguish between our narrow beam scanning technology and the laser technology incorporated by our competitors in their laser systems  and customers may not differentiate laser systems and procedures that have not received fda approval from fda approved systems and procedures 
any adverse consequences resulting from procedures performed with a competitor s systems or an unapproved laser system could adversely affect consumer acceptance of laser vision correction in general 
in addition  because laser vision correction is an elective procedure which is not typically covered by insurance and which involves more significant immediate expense than eyeglasses or contact lenses  adverse changes in the us or international economy may cause consumers to reassess their spending choices and to select lower cost alternatives for their vision correction needs 
any such shift in spending patterns could reduce the volume of lasik procedures performed which would  in turn  reduce our revenues from per procedure fees and sales of single use products such as our unishaper keratome and our ultraedge keratome blades 
the failure of laser vision correction to achieve continued market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
even if laser vision correction achieves and sustains market acceptance  sales of our keratome products could be adversely impacted if a laser procedure which does not require the creation of a corneal flap were to emerge as the procedure of choice 
new products or technologies could erode demand for our products or make them obsolete  and our business could be harmed if we cannot keep pace with advances in technology 
in addition to competing with eyeglasses and contact lenses  excimer laser vision correction competes or may compete with newer technologies such as intraocular lenses  corneal rings and surgical techniques using different or more advanced types of lasers 
two products that may become competitive within the near term are intraocular lenses  which are pending fda approval  and corneal rings  which were recently approved by the fda 
both of these products require procedures with lens implants  and their ultimate market acceptance is unknown at this time 
to the extent that any of these or other new technologies are perceived to be clinically superior or economically more attractive than currently marketed excimer laser vision correction procedures or techniques  they could erode demand for our excimer laser and keratome products  cause a reduction in selling prices of such products or render such products obsolete 
in addition  if one or more competing technologies achieves broader market acceptance or render laser vision correction procedures obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as is typical in the case of new and rapidly evolving industries  the demand and market for recently introduced products and technologies is uncertain  and we cannot be certain that our laserscan lsx laser system  unishaper single use keratome  ultrashaper durable keratome  ultraedge keratome blades or future new products and enhancements will be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  announcements or the anticipation of announcements of new products  whether for sale in the near future or at some later date  may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
company and business risks we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to our patent litigation with visx 
visx incorporated commenced a lawsuit in november in the united states district court  district of delaware  against the company alleging that our laserscan lsx laser system infringes one of visx s us patents for equipment used in ophthalmic surgery 
the laserscan lsx is the only laser system we are currently marketing and is the only laser system manufactured by us which is approved for sale to us customers 
the suit requests  among other things  injunctive relief  treble damages and attorneys fees and expenses 
management does not believe that our laserscan lsx laser system infringes the asserted visx patent 
however  we agreed to a stay of such litigation to pursue license negotiations with visx in an effort to help facilitate commercialization of the laserscan lsx in the us market 
we withdrew from license negotiations with visx in february  and after the stay of the litigation was lifted  we filed suit against visx  claiming non infringement and invalidity of the visx patent and asserting that visx infringes the tlc patent 
we also expect to begin to sell and ship our laserscan lsx laser systems in the us within the next week 
we believe that the visx lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously contest it 
however  if we are unsuccessful in defending this lawsuit  we may be enjoined from manufacturing and selling our laserscan lsx laser system in the us without a license from visx 
in addition  we may be subject to damages for past infringement 
no assurance can be given as to whether we will be subject to such damages or  if so  the amount of damages which we may be required to pay 
in addition  such patent litigation could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into license agreements in order to market our products 
such license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the outcome of patent litigation  particularly in jury trials  is inherently uncertain  and an unfavorable outcome in the visx litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will be required to significantly expand our us manufacturing operations to meet our business plan and must comply with stringent regulation of our manufacturing operations 
we intend to manufacture our laserscan lsx laser systems for sale in the us at our manufacturing facility in winter park  florida  and to continue to manufacture our laser systems for sale in international markets at our manufacturing facility in costa rica 
our us personnel have limited experience manufacturing laser systems 
we cannot  therefore  assure you that we will not encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our laser systems at our florida facility  including problems involving production delays  quality control or assurance  component supply and lack of qualified personnel 
in addition  we may in the future move our us manufacturing operations to another location leased by us in winter park  florida  which could result in unanticipated problems and production delays 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experience with the use of the product 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda  certain state agencies and international regulatory agencies 
we require that our key suppliers comply with recognized standards as well as our own quality standards  and regularly test the components and sub assemblies supplied to us 
any failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including the fda s quality systems good manufacturing practice qsr gmp regulations  could cause production and distribution of our products to be delayed or prohibited  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
in addition to the risk that the unishaper single use keratome or ultrashaper durable keratome will not be accepted in the marketplace  we are required to make certain minimum payments to the licensor under our keratome limited exclusive license agreement  unless the january amendment  as described below  is triggered by april  under the original agreement  we are required to provide an excimer laser system and pay a total of  to the licensor in two equal installments due six and months after the date of our receipt of the production molds for the unishaper product 
we provided the laser system to the licensor during the quarter ended june   and we received the molds in october we shipped the first unishaper single use keratome in december in addition  beginning seven months after the first commercial shipment  we will be required to make royalty payments equal to of our defined gross profits from the sale of our unishaper and ultrashaper keratomes  with a minimum royalty of  per calendar quarter for a period of eight quarters 
as a result of our obligations under this license arrangement  the minimum royalty payments we are required to make to the licensor may exceed our gross profits from sales of our unishaper and ultrashaper keratome products 
on january   the company entered into a first amendment to a license and royalty agreement related to certain keratome related products 
under the terms of the amendment  shares of common stock were placed in escrow and are included in common shares issued and outstanding on that date 
if certain conditions under the amendment are satisfied by april   the shares will be released from escrow 
otherwise  the shares will be returned to the company 
in addition  the company agreed to pay the licensors  upon execution of the amendment and  on april  the amendment eliminates the restriction on the company manufacturing  marketing and selling other keratomes  but the sale of such other keratomes is included in the gross profit to be shared with the licensors 
the company agreed to pay the costs of the unishaper final production molds 
our failure to timely obtain or expand regulatory approvals for our products and to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 
our excimer laser systems and keratome products are subject to strict governmental regulations which materially affect our ability to manufacture and market these products and directly impact our overall business prospects 
fda regulations impose design and performance standards  labeling and reporting requirements  and submission conditions in advance of marketing for all medical laser products in the us new product introductions  expanded treatment types and levels for approved products  and significant design or manufacturing modifications require a premarket clearance or approval by the fda prior to commercialization in the us the fda approval process  which is lengthy and uncertain  requires supporting clinical studies and substantial commitments of financial and management resources 
failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and clearances in the us and other countries  or significant delays in obtaining these approvals and clearances  could prevent us from marketing our products for either approved or expanded indications or treatments  which could substantially decrease our future revenues 
additionally  product and procedure labeling and all forms of promotional activities are subject to examination by the fda  and current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing by manufacturers of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with these requirements may result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  suspension of manufacturing  denial or withdrawal of pmas  and criminal prosecution 
laser products marketed in foreign countries are often subject to local laws governing health product development processes  which may impose additional costs for overseas product development 
future legislative or administrative requirements  in the us or elsewhere  may adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain regulatory approval for our products 
the failure to obtain approvals for new or additional uses on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may be adversely affected 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including our narrow beam scanning laser systems 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation or other legal proceedings in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity 
these legal proceedings may consume considerable resources  including management time and attention  which would be diverted from the operation of our business  and the outcome of any such legal proceeding is inherently uncertain 
we are aware that certain competitors are developing products that may potentially infringe patents owned or licensed exclusively by us 
in order to protect our rights in these patents  we may find it necessary to assert and pursue infringement claims against such third parties 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources litigating such infringement claims and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in resolving such claims or that the resolution of any such dispute will be on terms that are favorable to us 
patent infringement allegations may impair our ability to manufacture and market our products 
there are a number of us and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery that we do not own or have the right to use 
if we were found to infringe a patent in a particular market  lasersight and its customers may be enjoined from manufacturing  marketing  selling and using the infringing product in the market and may be liable for damages for any past infringement of such rights 
in order to continue using such rights  we would be required to obtain a license  which may require us to make royalty  per procedure or other fee payments 
we cannot be certain if we or our customers will be successful in securing licenses  or that if we obtain licenses  such licenses will be available on acceptable terms 
alternatively  we might be required to redesign the infringing aspects of these products 
any redesign efforts that we undertake could be expensive and might require regulatory review 
furthermore  the redesign efforts could delay the reintroduction of these products into certain markets  or may be so significant as to be impractical 
if redesign efforts were impractical  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling the infringing products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently involved in patent litigation with visx  and such allegations are common in our industry 
in  summit and visx formed a us partnership  pillar point partners  to pool certain of their patents related to corneal sculpting technologies 
as part of their agreement to dissolve pillar point in june  summit and visx granted each other a worldwide  royalty free cross license whereby each party has full rights to license for use with its own systems all existing patents owned by either company relating to laser vision correction 
in connection with our march settlement of litigation with pillar point regarding alleged infringement by our lasers of certain us and foreign patents  we entered into a license agreement with visx covering various foreign patents and patent applications pursuant to which we pay royalties to visx and agreed to notify visx before we began manufacturing and selling our laser systems in the us while we do not believe our laser systems or keratome products infringe any valid and enforceable patents held by visx  summit or any other person  we cannot assure you that one or more of our competitors or other persons will not assert that our products infringe their intellectual property  or that we will not in the future be deemed to infringe one or more patents owned by them or some other party 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to market one or more of our products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see risk factors and uncertainties we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to our patent litigation with visx 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international sales 
our international sales accounted for and of our total revenues during the year ended december  and the year ended december   respectively 
in the future  we expect that sales to international accounts will represent a lower percentage of our total sales as a result of our recent regulatory approval to market our laserscan lsx laser system in the us  the anticipated commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome in the second quarter of  and the recent commercial launch of our ultraedge keratome blades and our unishaper single use keratome 
the majority of our international revenues for the year ended december  were from customers in canada  mexico spain   italy  belgium and france  and for the year ended december  were from customers in canada  china  brazil  mexico  italy  argentina  south africa  and turkey 
international sales of our products may be limited or disrupted by o the imposition of government controls  o export license requirements  o economic or political instability  o trade restrictions  o difficulties in obtaining or maintaining export licenses  o changes in tariffs  and o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
our sales have historically been and are expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars 
the european economic union s conversion to a common currency  the euro  is not expected to have a material impact on our business 
however  due to our significant export sales  we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the effective price in local currencies of our products 
this could result in reduced sales  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting receivables relating to our international sales 
our supply of certain critical components and systems may be interrupted because of our reliance on a limited number of suppliers 
we currently purchase certain components used in the production  operation and maintenance of our laser systems and keratome products from a limited number of suppliers and certain key components are provided by a single vendor 
for example  all of our keratome blades are manufactured exclusively by becton dickinson pursuant to our agreement with them  and all of our unishaper single use keratome products are manufactured exclusively by frantz medical development ltd 
pursuant to our agreement with them 
we do not have written long term contracts with providers of some key laser system components  including tui lasertechnik und laserintegration gmbh  which currently is a single source supplier for the laser heads used in our laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
currently  sensomotoric instruments gmbh  teltow  germany  is a single source for the eye tracker boards used in the laserscan lsx 
any interruption in the supply of critical laser or keratome components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of our key suppliers ceases providing us with products of acceptable quality and quantity at a competitive price in a timely fashion  we would have to locate and contract with a substitute supplier and  in some cases  such substitute suppliers would need to be qualified by the fda 
if substitute suppliers cannot be located and qualified in a timely manner or could not provide required products on commercially reasonable terms  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unlawful tampering of our system configurations could result in reduced revenues 
we include a procedure counting mechanism on laserscan lsx lasers manufactured for sale and use in the us users of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system could tamper with the software or hardware configuration of the system so as to alter or eliminate the procedure counting mechanism that facilitates the collection of per procedure fees 
unauthorized tampering with our procedure counting mechanism by users could result in the loss of per procedure fees 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key employees  especially michael r 
farris  our president and chief executive officer 
a loss of one or more such officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any officer or key employee 
as we commercially launch our laser system and keratome products in the us  we will need to continue to implement and expand our operational  sales and marketing  financial and management resources and controls 
while to date we have not experienced problems recruiting or retaining the personnel necessary to expand our business  we cannot assure you that we will not have such problems in the future 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals for necessary positions  and if we are unable to effectively manage growth in our domestic or international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inadequacy or unavailability of insurance may expose us to substantial product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks and possible adverse publicity that are inherent in the development  testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices for human use 
these risks increase with respect to our products that receive regulatory approval for commercialization 
we have agreed in the past  and we will likely agree in the future  to indemnify certain medical institutions and personnel who conduct and participate in our clinical studies 
while we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that any such liability will be covered by our insurance or that damages will not exceed the limits of our coverage 
even if a claim is covered by insurance  the costs of defending a product liability  malpractice  negligence or other action  and the assessment of damages in excess of insurance coverage in the event of a successful product liability claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  product liability insurance may not continue to be available  either at existing or increased levels of coverage  on commercially reasonable terms 
financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue through at least the first quarter of we experienced significant net losses and deficits in cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and  as set forth in the following table 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in the future 
year ended december  net loss million million million deficit in cash flow from operations million million million as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
although we monitor the status of our receivables and maintain a reserve for estimated losses  we cannot be certain that our reserves for estimated losses  which were approximately million at december   will be sufficient to cover the amount of our actual write offs over time 
at december   our net trade accounts and notes receivable totaled approximately million  and accrued commissions  the payment of which generally depends on the collection of such net trade accounts and notes receivable  totaled approximately million 
actual write offs that exceed amounts reserved could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of any loss that we may have to recognize in connection with our inability to collect receivables is principally dependent on our customer s ongoing financial condition  their ability to generate revenues from our laser systems  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against delinquent customers 
our ability to evaluate the financial condition and revenue generating ability of our prospective customers located outside of the us  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against customers located outside of the us  is generally more limited than for our customers located in the us our agreements with our international customers typically provide that the contracts are governed by florida law 
we have not determined whether or to what extent courts or administrative agencies located in foreign countries would enforce our right to collect such receivables or to recover laser systems from customers in the event of a customer s payment default 
when a customer is not paying according to established terms  we attempt to communicate and understand the underlying causes and work with the customer to resolve any issues we can control or influence 
in most cases  we have been able to resolve the customer s issues and continue to collect our receivable  either on the original schedule or under restructured terms 
if such issues are not resolved  we evaluate our legal and other alternatives based on existing facts and circumstances 
in most such cases  we have concluded that the account should be written off as uncollectible 
at december   we had extended the original payment terms of laser customer accounts totaling approximately million by periods ranging from to months 
such restructured receivables represent approximately of our gross receivables as of that date 
our liquidity and operating cash flow would be adversely affected if additional extensions become necessary in the future 
in addition  it would be more difficult to collect laser system receivables if the payment schedule extends beyond the expected or actual economic life of the system  which we estimate to be approximately five to seven years 
to date  we do not believe any payment schedule extends beyond the economic life of the applicable laser system 
we could require additional financing which might not be available if we need it 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced deficits in cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
we believe that the proceeds from our january private placement of common stock  together with our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next months in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the commercial acceptance of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system  our ultraedge keratome blades and our unishaper single use keratomes  the successful validity testing and subsequent commercial acceptance of our ultrashaper durable keratome  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not collect a material portion of current receivables in a timely manner  or experience less market demand for our products than we anticipate  our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that we will not seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
other than the million credit facility signed in june with the huntington national bank which expires in june  we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future to the extent required or that  if available  it will be on commercially acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the terms of the new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt could require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest and may render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
common stock risks variations in our sales and operating results may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  historically a significant portion of our laser system orders for a particular quarter have been received and shipped near the end of the quarter 
as a result  our operating results for any quarter often depend on the timing of the receipt of orders and the subsequent shipment of our laser systems 
other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include o timing of regulatory approvals and the introduction or delays in shipment of new products  o reductions  cancellations or fulfillment of major orders  o the addition or loss of significant customers  o the relative mix of our business  o changes in pricing by us or our competitors  o costs related to expansion of our business  and o increased competition 
as a result of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in some quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above 
the market price of our common stock may continue to experience extreme fluctuations due to market conditions that are unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market  and in particular the securities of technology companies like us  could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  developments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of refractive vision correction procedures  and changes in reports and recommendations of securities analysts  have and may continue to have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the significant number of shares eligible for future sale and dilutive stock issuances may adversely affect our stock price 
sales  or the possibility of sales  of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
substantially all of our  shares of common stock outstanding at march  were freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of  except to the extent such shares are held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule under the securities act or subject only to the satisfaction of a prospectus delivery requirement 
shares of common stock which we may issue in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings or pursuant to outstanding warrants or agreements could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause significant dilution in our earnings per share and net book value per share 
we may be required to issue more than eight million additional shares of common stock upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock  the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options  and the satisfaction of certain contingent contractual obligations 
see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters possible dilutive issuances of common stock 
the anti dilution provisions of certain of our existing securities and obligations require us to issue additional shares if we issue shares of common stock below specified price levels 
if a future share issuance triggers these adjustments  the beneficiaries of such provisions effectively receive some protection from declines in the market price of our common stock  while our other stockholders incur additional dilution of their ownership interest 
we may include similar anti dilution provisions in securities issued in connection with future financings 
anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and stockholder rights plan may make an acquisition of lasersight more difficult and could prevent you from receiving a premium over the market price of our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors  discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay  defer or prevent a change in control of lasersight  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the economic interests of our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder action  and our by laws require advance notice of director nominations or other proposals by stockholders 
lasersight also is subject to provisions of delaware corporation law that prohibit a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or more of the corporation s common stock an interested stockholder for three years after the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights agreement  or poison pill  and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire or more of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
acquisition risks past and possible future acquisitions that are not successfully integrated with our existing operations may adversely affect our business 
we have made several significant acquisitions since  and we may in the future selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances with  companies whose business or technology complement our business 
we may not be able to identify suitable candidates to acquire or enter into joint ventures or other arrangements with entities  and we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms for such activities 
in addition  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel  technology and operations of any acquired companies  which could prevent us from realizing expected synergies  and may incur unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
this could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other resources 
amortization and charges relating to our significant intangible assets could adversely affect our stock price and reported net income or loss 
of our total assets at december   approximately million  or  were goodwill or other intangible assets 
any reduction in net income or increase in net loss resulting from the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from future acquisitions by us may have an adverse impact upon the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the event of a sale of lasersight or our assets  we cannot be certain that the value of such intangible assets would be recovered
