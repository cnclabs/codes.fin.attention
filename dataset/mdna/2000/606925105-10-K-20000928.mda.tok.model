item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this section  readers are given a more detailed assessment of the company s operating results and changes in financial position over the periods discussed 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
please note that references in this section to this year and last year refer to its fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
overview mobius is a leading provider of software products designed to provide network and web based access  presentation and distribution of large volumes of diverse enterprise information 
major financial services  healthcare  manufacturing  retail and telecommunications companies and governmental entities use the company s products to facilitate customer service and other mission critical functions 
founded in  the company provided information storage  retrieval and presentation products and support  as well as consulting services throughout its first decade 
in  the company decided to focus primarily on developing and marketing software products and  as a result  sold its consulting services business 
in april  the company s registration statement was declared effective for its initial public offering ipo of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
further detail about the ipo is provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased sales of licenses 
the company believes that year issues significantly affected the purchasing patterns of its customers and potential customers 
we believe that many companies expended significant resources to correct or modify their existing software systems to be year compliant 
we believe that these expenditures resulted in reduced funds to purchase software products such as those that mobius offers 
the company derives its revenues primarily from server and client product license fees and related annual maintenance fees 
this year of total revenues were generated by software license fees and were generated by maintenance and other fees 
license revenues of viewdirect and documentdirect products have historically accounted for a majority of the company s license revenues and for a significant portion of total revenues 
this year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
last year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
the company anticipates in the foreseeable future that license revenue from these products will continue to account for a significant portion of license and total revenues 
mobius s growing customer base has led to continued growth in maintenance revenues  from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
maintenance consists primarily of revenue for post contract support services provided by the company for its products 
other revenue results when mobius occasionally hires independent professional service organizations to provide customers with post sale assistance 
international revenues increased this year to million from million last year and million in fiscal as a group  the company s international subsidiaries have not achieved budgeted sales and have been unprofitable to date  and mobius expects achieving profitability will require significant management attention and financial resources 
the company intends to expand its international sales activities as part of its business strategy 
the majority of mobius current international revenues are derived from the operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries and through agents 
the company receives a royalty that is a percent of agent or subsidiary sales of software licenses and maintenance contracts to international customers 
the company s subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing mobius to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of mobius control 
to date  most of these subsidiaries have operated at a loss  which cannot be consolidated for united states income tax purposes 
consequently  in prior years  the company has experienced a substantially higher effective tax rate than the us federal statutory rate as no tax benefit has been provided for the majority of these foreign losses 
to the extent the company is successful at bringing its foreign subsidiaries to profitability  the company s effective tax rate will be below the us federal tax statutory rate as a result of realizing the benefit of the tax loss carryforwards currently being generated outside of the united states 
in addition  to the extent that mobius uses different tax structures for new foreign subsidiaries  which would permit consolidation of losses for us tax purposes  the effective tax rate will approach the us federal statutory rate 
capitalization of internally developed software costs is required once technological feasibility is established 
the period between achieving technological feasibility  which we have defined as the establishment of a working model  and the general availability of such software has been short and  therefore  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
accordingly  the company has not capitalized any software development costs and currently does not anticipate having significant development costs that are eligible for capitalization in the foreseeable future 
software development costs are included in research and development expenses 
for more information on the company s capitalization of software development costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

costs of revenues 
the costs of software license revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of software license revenues in those years 
the costs of software license revenue decreased in fiscal versus primarily due to increased license revenues from products that were developed exclusively by the company and therefore do not require royalty payments 
the decrease in fiscal is a result of lower license sales which were subject to royalties 
the costs of maintenance and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of maintenance and other revenues in those years 
the increases in costs of maintenance and other revenues were primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs and subcontractor costs associated with post sales assistance

these expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
sales and marketing expenses have increased in fiscal primarily because the company paid more commissions and bonuses for selling more software licenses and hired additional sales personnel 
the increase in fiscal is related to additional spending for the click n done 
com products  and increased personnel related costs for marketing  partially offset by a decrease in sales commissions and bonus due to decreased sales of software licenses

see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
quarterly revenues and operating results are expected to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including lengthy product sales cycles  changes in the level of operating expenses  demand for the company s products  introductions of new products and product enhancements by mobius or mobius s competitors  changes in customer budgets  competitive conditions in the industry and general domestic and international economic conditions 
license revenues typically peak during the fourth fiscal quarter and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales force incentive programs which recognize and reward sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual and other periodic performance quotas  as well as the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  mobius has funded its operations principally through cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  equity or bank financings 
in april  the company completed its initial public offering  which generated net proceeds of million 
as of june   mobius had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from the million held at june  in addition  mobius had marketable securities of million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal mobius s primary sources of cash during and was its net income supported by increases in its deferred income taxes and decreases in items requiring working capital 
during fiscal  mobius use of cash in operating activities was primarily caused by its net loss and an increase in accounts receivable offset by collections on software license installments and growth in deferred revenues 
software license installments  which decreased from million at june  to million at end of fiscal  represent payments due from customers for license fees that are paid over the term of the installment agreement 
these payments are typically made over to year terms 
since payments are made over multiple reporting periods  software license installments can fluctuate with the amount of license revenue sold on an installment basis 
net accounts receivable increased from million at june  to million at june   largely as a result of the timing of license sales and billings of maintenance renewals 
deferred revenue increased from million at june  to million at june  as a result of an increase in unrecognized license revenue 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unrecognized portion of maintenance billings and the unrecognized portion of maintenance revenue unbundled from customer license agreements which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  cash of million  million and million was used for the purchase of computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  respectively 
during fiscal  the company has undertaken significant capital projects  including the installation of an automated sales force computer system  implementation of a new accounting system and expansion of the rye headquarters building 
in addition  in fiscal  million of marketable securities were purchased and million of marketable securities were sold 
mobius also made investments of  and  in home account network and flooz 
com  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  primarily due to the company s ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of  was primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options 
this year  cash provided by financing activities of  was primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options and sales of company common stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
bad debt reserves accounts receivable reserves are primarily calculated by identifying problem accounts and in recognition that some customers decide to cancel or reduce the number of products covered by maintenance arrangements upon their anniversary but do not always notify mobius in sufficient time to prevent some portion of the annual maintenance billings from being recognized 
mobius also has a small reserve to absorb losses based upon historical experience that may result from current receivables 
mobius specifically identifies problem accounts by the age of the receivable and through discussions with the customer and mobius sales representatives 
based on that information  mobius exercises its best judgment as to what portion of the accounts receivable balance requires a reserve 
at june  and june  approximately and of the total accounts receivable reserve balances related to specific accounts  respectively 
to the extent that an account for which a specific reserve was provided is subsequently collected  mobius reduces the reserves in the period of collection 
software license installment reserves have consistently been determined as a percentage of software license installments to provide for potential bankruptcies and contractual disputes 
at june  and june   software license installments were approximately million and million of which and were customer balances greater than  respectively 
customer balances for software license installments tend to be large due to the selling price of mobius products 
software license installment and accounts receivable reserves were million at june  and investments mobius investment decisions are divided into two categories  since they are managed differently  speculative or strategic investments  and cash management 
the latter is done by two fund managers  goldman sachs and bank of boston 
these firms follow policy guidelines approved by our board of directors and monitored by the company s finance staff 
longer term speculative or strategic investment decisions are made by the board of directors based upon the recommendation of management regarding the investment potential or strategic fit 
these investments are reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
in june  the company invested  in home account network han  a privately held  information technology company providing processing and internet outsourcing to financial services companies 
during fiscal  mobius provided an additional  to han in short term loans that were converted to preferred stock in may there are several reasons for the investment in home account network han 
first  we believe that they have experienced management and a significant market opportunity in a related industry sector 
second  we believe that  if the venture was successful  it would provide substantial return to mobius shareholders 
mobius holds a minority ownership position  which  if the preferred interest is converted to common stock  would be less than 
mobius does not sit on the board of directors  nor influence day to day operations of han 
the short term loans accrued interest at an annual rate of for the first month and each month until the loans were converted to preferred stock in may mobius regularly reviews the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts of han to assess the investment s recoverability 
during the most recent quarter  han continued to consume cash and mobius concluded that an other than temporary impairment loss occurred 
mobius believes that the amount of cash consumed by han is an appropriate indicator for measuring the impairment of this investment since han had consumed most of the cash provided through june   there was no equity below these financing rounds and there is no obligation for any of the investors to provide additional capital 
based on these factors  we concluded that the investment had been impaired and that the impairment was other than temporary 
for the year ended june   a  impairment loss has been recorded 
at june   the remaining carrying value of the han investment is  and is included within other non current assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recovery of our remaining investment in han and expect that we will continue to use the amount of cash consumed as an indicator of current value 
to the extent that han continues to consume cash and other information suggests that the impairment is other than temporary  we expect to continue to write down the investment 
in january  the company made a strategic investment of  in flooz

sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no

is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  these statements are not expected to significantly effect mobius  as mobius does not have any significant derivative instruments or hedging activities 
statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amended sop and clarified the specification of what was considered vendor specific evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement was adopted by mobius on july  the adoption of the provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on mobius operating results  financial position or cash flows

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
with certain exceptions  fin applies prospectively to new awards  exchanges of awards in a business combination  modifications to outstanding awards and changes in grantee status on or after july  mobius does not believe that the implementation of fin will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
other pronouncements issued by the fasb or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not significant to the financial statements of mobius 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mobius investment portfolio is subject to interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of mobius investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing the interest income  without significantly increasing risk 
some of the marketable securities that mobius has invested in may be subject to market rate interest risk 
this means a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the security to fluctuate 
for example  if mobius holds a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rates and the prevailing interest rates later rise  the market value of the marketable security will probably decline 
at june   mobius primarily held debt securities 
mobius may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to accounts receivable and accounts payable that may be denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in certain foreign jurisdictions 
to the extent that such foreign currency transactions are negatively or positively effected by foreign currency fluctuations  foreign currency transaction losses or gains would be recognized 
we do not use derivative financial investments to limit our foreign exchange expense
