results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased by  in fiscal over fiscal the majority  of this increase in attributable to the revenues generated by usc canterbury  which was acquired in october  the revenues for the other existing subsidiaries remained fairly constant 
the company continues to develop alternative revenue streams such as on line learning  technical staffing services and web development 
it is believed that these additional revenue streams will become more significant in fiscal and beyond 
costs and expenses costs and expenses increased by  in fiscal over the previous year 
again  the most significant portion of this increase  is attributable to costs associated with usc canterbury for the fourth quarter of the year 
the remaining increase of  is due to increased labor and personnel costs in the training segment

there was a planned reduction in marketing expense for calc canterbury of  during the year the company continued to downsize the catalog and the mailing list 
more and more of the public registrations are coming through the calc canterbury web site  which has allowed for the reduction in printing and postage expenses 
the balance of the reduction is primarily due to reduced costs associated with sales personnel

as technology continues to improve  the company has been able to downsize several support functions  relying more on information generated and processed by in house computer applications

the company believes that this current investment will provide long term benefits to the customers and hence  revenues 
costs and expenses costs and expenses decreased by  in fiscal over the previous year 
this most significant cause of this decrease was the reduction in rent expense of  in versus the reduction was due primarily to the company recognizing in costs associated with terminating certain leases for its management training company s facilities

selling expense decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal due to reduced marketing expenses related to calc canterbury

general and administrative expense decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal decreased legal expenses of  consulting fees of  and general public company corporate expenses of  comprise the bulk of the reduction 
the company believes that the reduced level of these expenses will continue into fiscal interest income for fiscal increased by  over the prior year due to recognition of interest income on the portion of the company s revolving credit facility with chase bank that was assumed by the owners of landscape maintenance services 
this income was not recognized in fiscal interest expense decreased by  in fiscal versus fiscal the reduction in outstanding borrowings on the term loan is the major cause for this reduction
