north american net sales growth in resulted primarily from increases in unit sales across most product categories reflecting strong industry fundamentals 
in  the industry began to soften due to financial volatility in asian and latin american markets  which  along with a high level of merger and acquisition activity within the us fortune companies  contributed to the lack of sales growth

additionally  the company experienced the expected margin decrease of approximately percentage points with the consolidation of steelcase strafor  which has historically had lower margins 
the overall decrease in gross margin for was partially offset by lower variable compensation 
in and  margins remained relatively flat as the company s continued efforts to reduce costs and to improve efficiencies were tempered by upfront investments required to fund cost reduction efforts to be realized in future periods  as well as the expected disruptions and inefficiencies associated with the company being in the midst of launching the largest product portfolio in its history

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are 
foreign exchange risks 
interest rates on debt foreign exchange risks international operations constituted approximately and of the company s and consolidated operating income  respectively 
operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to solely isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect on these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company generally does not hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally and the cost benefit of hedging reported earnings is not justifiable 
changes in foreign exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating the company s international operating profit for relate to the euro and the canadian dollar 
the company estimates that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have reduced operating profit by approximately million in and million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
for and  this represents approximately and  respectively  of the company s non us operating profit and of consolidated operating profit 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one country may or may not be offset by losses from another country 
foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
transaction gains and losses are not material for the company 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily on its notes receivable and leased assets  its short term borrowings and long term debt 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps and caps and through balancing the notional amount of fixed and variable rate liabilities with fixed and variable rate assets where appropriate 
management estimates that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for or  based upon the year end levels of exposed assets and liabilities
