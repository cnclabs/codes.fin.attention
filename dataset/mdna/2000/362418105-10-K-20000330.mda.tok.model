item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except property and per share data we are a reit focused within the multifamily industry in markets throughout the united states that have high job growth and are resilient to economic downturns 
our operating performance relies predominantly on net operating income from our apartment communities 
net operating income is determined by rental revenues and operating expenses  which are affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets 
our performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and our ability to develop and acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of our blended cost of capital 
business objectives and strategy our objective is to increase shareholder value by producing consistent high quality earnings to sustain dividend growth and annual total returns that exceed the multifamily sector average 
to achieve that objective  we employ a number of business strategies 
first  our long term investment strategy is research driven with the objective of creating a portfolio of high quality assets in approximately six to eight strategically selected markets that are complementary through economic diversity and characterized by high job growth and resiliency to national economic downturns 
we believe such a portfolio will provide predictable growth in operating cash flow on a sustainable basis 
second  we adhere to a strategy of owning and operating high quality  class aa a apartment communities under the gables brand 
we believe that such communities  when located in highly desirable areas to live and supplemented with high quality service and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice who is willing to pay a premium for location preference  superior service and high quality communities 
the resulting portfolio should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates 
this  coupled with more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements associated with high quality construction materials  should lead to operating margins that exceed national averages for the multifamily sector and sustainable growth in operating cash flow 
third  our aim is to be recognized as the employer of choice within the industry 
our mission of taking care of the way people live is a cornerstone of our strategy  involving innovative human resource practices that we believe will attract and retain the highest caliber associates 
because of our long established presence as a fully integrated apartment management  development  construction  acquisition and disposition company within our markets  we have the ability to offer multi faceted career opportunities among the various disciplines within the industry 
finally  our capital strategy is to maximize return on invested capital while maintaining financial flexibility through a conservative  investment grade credit profile 
we judiciously manage our capital and are able to recycle existing capital through asset dispositions 
we believe the successful execution of these strategies will result in operating cash flow and dividend growth  producing annual total returns that exceed the multifamily reit sector average 
we believe we are well positioned to continue achieving our objectives because of our long established presence as a fully integrated real estate company in our markets 
this local market presence creates a competitive advantage in generating increased cash flow from property operations during different economic cycles and new investment opportunities that involve site selection  market information and requests for entitlements and zoning petitions 
portfolio wide occupancy levels have remained high and portfolio wide rental rates have continued to increase during each of the last several years 
we expect portfolio wide rental expenses to increase at a rate slightly ahead of inflation but less than the increase in property revenues for the coming twelve months 
our ongoing evaluation of the growth prospects for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
in that event  we would intend to sell the asset and utilize the net proceeds from any such sale to invest in new assets expected to have better growth prospects  reduce indebtedness or  in certain circumstances with appropriate approval from our board of trustees  repurchase outstanding common shares 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet existing construction  acquisition  and leasing activities 
if market conditions warrant  we would anticipate adjusting staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations

the repayments of borrowings were funded by the net cash provided by investing activities 
during the year ended december   we had net borrowings of million  which were used in conjunction with million of proceeds from a common share offering and the series b preferred unit offering primarily to fund acquisition and development activities discussed in the above paragraph 
these proceeds from financing activities were offset in part by net payments of dividends and distributions totaling million 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that they currently distribute of their ordinary taxable income 
provided we maintain our qualification as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed net income 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of  cash and cash equivalents of  and principal escrow deposits reflected in restricted cash of  our indebtedness has an average of years to maturity at december  the aggregate maturities of notes payable at december  are as follows and thereafter  dividends through the fourth quarter of have been paid from cash provided by operating activities 
we anticipate that dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis from cash provided by operating activities 
we have met and expect to continue to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations 
our net cash provided by operations has been adequate and we believe it will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations to the communities  in addition to monthly principal amortization payments  are also expected to be funded from net cash provided by operations 
we anticipate that construction and development activities as well as land purchases will be initially funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we expect to meet certain of our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  repayment of short term financing of construction and development activities and possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of debt securities or equity securities  private equity investments in the form of joint ventures  or through the disposition of assets which  in our evaluation  may no longer meet our investment requirements 
million credit facility we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of banks 
the facility currently has a maturity date of may  with two one year extension options 
borrowings under the facility currently bear interest at our option of libor plus or prime minus 
such scheduled interest rates may be adjusted up or down based on changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings 
we may also enter into competitive bid loans with participating banks for up to million at rates below the scheduled rates 
in addition  we pay an annual facility fee equal to of the million commitment 
availability under the facility is based on the value of our unencumbered real estate assets as compared to the amount of our unsecured indebtedness 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the facility and  therefore  million of remaining capacity on the million commitment 
million credit facility we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank that currently bears interest at libor plus 
we expect to exercise one of our unlimited one year extension options prior to the facility s current maturity in october  we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  million borrowing facility we have a million unsecured borrowing facility with a bank 
the interest rate and maturity date related to each draw on this facility is agreed to by both parties prior to each draw 
we expect the facility  which currently matures in april   to be renewed for an additional one year term at maturity 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at an interest rate of 
restrictive covenants certain of our debt agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default  including covenants which restrict the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts our discretion to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year the operating partnership may only distribute up to of its consolidated income available for distribution as defined in the related agreement exclusive of distributions of capital gains for such year 
the applicable debt agreements contain exceptions to these limitations to allow the operating partnership to make any distributions necessary to allow us to maintain our status as a reit 
we do not anticipate that this provision will adversely effect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions or our ability to declare dividends  as currently anticipated 
inflation substantially all leases at our communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable us to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to lessen the impact of cost increases arising from inflation 
certain factors affecting future operating results this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume and other similar expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
these statements include  among other things  statements regarding our intent  belief or expectations with respect to the following the declaration or payment of distributions  potential developments or acquisitions or dispositions of properties  assets or other entities  our policies regarding investments  indebtedness  acquisitions  dispositions  financings  conflicts of interest and other matters  our qualification as a reit under the code  the real estate markets in which we operate  in general  the availability of debt and equity financing  interest rates and general economic conditions  and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which are  in some cases  beyond our control and may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
in addition to the factors discussed under the risk factors section in item  some of the factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following we may abandon or fail to secure development opportunities  construction costs of a community may exceed original estimates  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues  occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control  financing may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment  preventing such indebtedness from being refinanced or  if financed  causing such refinancing to occur on terms that are not as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness

we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements 
year the year issue occurs when business application software or embedded microcontrollers use two digits to specify the year  rather than four 
as a result  computers with time sensitive software programs may recognize a date using as the year instead of the year which could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business operations 
our efforts to address the year issue prior to january  were divided into the following phases identifying all equipment that could have been affected by the year issue  contacting the vendors and third party providers that maintained and or supported such equipment to obtain a year compliance certification  assembling a list of items that would not be compliant and prioritizing the items to be either replaced or retrofitted  and replacing or retrofitting items that were not year compliant  and identifying and implementing alternative solutions to items that could not be replaced or retrofitted 
we have not experienced any significant disruptions to date in mission critical systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
in addition  we are not aware of any significant year issues with our third party service providers or vendors 
costs of addressing the year issue have not been material to our financial condition or results of operations  and were primarily related to equipment upgrades and allocation of personnel resources 
in addition  we do not expect to incur any future material costs related to the year issue 
although we believe our computer systems will continue to function properly going forward  there can be no assurance that such systems  or those systems of other companies on which we rely  will not experience some type of problem related to the year issue  and that such problems will not result in material business interruptions  loss of revenues or other adverse effects 
accordingly  we will continue to monitor our mission critical systems and those of our third party service providers and vendors throughout the year supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and capital expenditures 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of assets or debt restructuring plus certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  extraordinary or unusual items as well as significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of ffo are typically disregarded in its calculation 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  our ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less recurring  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures 
ffo and affo should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures  and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our cash needs and cash flows 
a reconciliation of ffo and affo follows years ended december  net income available to common shareholders   minority interest of common unitholders in operating partnership  gain on sale of real estate assets  severance costs a  loss on treasury locks b  amortization of loss on extension of used treasury locks real estate asset depreciation wholly owned real estate assets   joint venture real estate assets total depreciation   funds from operations basic amortization of discount on long term liability c funds from operations diluted   recurring  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures carpet   roofing exterior painting appliances other additions and improvements   total capital expenditures   adjusted funds from operations diluted average common shares and units outstanding basic   average common shares and units outstanding diluted c  a severance costs of  for the year ended december  represent charges associated with organizational changes resulting from management succession directives  including the resignation of the former chairman and chief executive officer and the former chief operating officer 
the nareit definition of ffo disregards significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of ffo over time 
we believe the organizational changes that resulted in the charge are unusual and non recurring in nature 
we also believe that organizational changes could arise in the future that could result in similar charges 
we believe these severance costs materially distort the comparative measurement of ffo and  therefore  have been disregarded in the calculation of ffo pursuant to the nareit definition of ffo 
b loss on treasury locks of  for the year ended december  represents mark to market losses recorded upon the expiration of the terms of treasury lock agreements that were entered into in anticipation of a projected debt offering  subsequently extended in connection with modifications in the projected timing of the debt offering as a result of unanticipated capital transactions  including the south florida acquisition  and terminated due to economic conditions affecting the unsecured debt market 
the nareit definition of ffo disregards significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of ffo over time 
while we may utilize derivative financial instruments such as rate locks to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of prospective financing transactions  we believe the specific series of events and circumstances that resulted in the loss of hedge accounting for those treasury locks is unusual and non recurring in nature 
we also believe that different events and circumstances could arise in the future that could result in similar losses 
we believe these losses materially distort the comparative measurement of ffo and  therefore  have been disregarded in the calculation of ffo pursuant to the nareit definition of ffo 
c this obligation was settled with units 
such units are excluded from basic shares and units outstanding  but are included in the calculation of diluted shares and units outstanding 
effective january   nareit amended its definition of ffo to include in ffo all non recurring items  except for those that are defined as extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
we will report the revised measure beginning with our first quarter of results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our capital structure includes the use of variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
as such  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
we periodically seek input from third party consultants regarding market interest rate and credit risk in order to evaluate our interest rate exposure 
in certain situations  we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of rate caps  rate swaps or rate locks  to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we do not utilize such instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we typically refinance maturing debt instruments at then existing market interest rates and terms which may be more or less than the interest rates and terms on the maturing debt 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates in effect at december  by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average interest rates presented in this table are inclusive of credit enhancement fees 
for interest rate protection agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and related weighted average pay rates by fiscal year of maturity 
there have been no substantial changes in our market risk profile from the preceding year and the assumptions are consistent with prior year assumptions 
expected year of maturity thereafter total total debt conventional fixed rate     average interest rate tax exempt fixed rate average interest rate tax exempt variable rate average interest rate credit facilities average interest rate variable rate term loan average interest rate total debt average interest rate interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable  average pay rate receive rate libor libor libor interest rate cap pay fixed receive variable maximum pay rate receive rate libor we estimate that the fair value of our debt approximates carrying value based upon our effective current borrowing rate for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities
