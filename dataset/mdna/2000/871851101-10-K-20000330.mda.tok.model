industry wide shortages in certain key pc components also resulted in increased costs 
the relatively lower sales contribution from higher margin industrial products continues to affect gross margin percentage unfavorably 
a portion of the decline in gross profit margin has been offset by the continued decline of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
while selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million in from million in  as a percentage of net sales they decreased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to reduced catalog costs in north america as a result of the increased efficiencies from larger average order sizes  vendor supported advertising  continued expense control and the leveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger sales base

implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency the company has extensive operations in certain european countries  including france  germany  italy  the netherlands  spain  sweden  england and scotland 
it also sells to additional countries in europe 
for the fiscal year  approximately of the company s net sales were in europe 
with the exception of sweden and the united kingdom  all of the countries in which the company has operations have confirmed their participation in a new country european common currency  the euro 
the adoption of such common currency is being phased in over a three year period which started in january during such phase in period  both the euro and the historical currency of a country will be valid  although new euro denominated currency will not be issued until each member country will decide when its legacy currency will cease to be legal tender  which will occur during the period january through june  until the introduction of euro denominated currency  the paying party will have the option to decide whether to pay in the legacy currency or in euros converted to the legacy currency 
among other possible economic implications  it is expected that the adoption of a common currency will generally lead to greater price transparency and thereby increased competition within the common currency zone 
for instance  with a single currency applicable to the entire region  consumers may be able to more easily discern differences in price for the company s products between different countries and modify their buying practices accordingly 
this is less likely to be a factor for the company than for many other companies since the company currently only advertises the euro price on its internet sites  not in its catalogs 
also  purchasers of low cost individual products are less likely to shop for a lower euro price outside of their geographic location 
the company will still use national catalogs  in the appropriate language  notwithstanding the introduction of the euro 
whether any such price differentials will lead to significant changes in purchasing practices by the company s customers depends on other factors as well  such as convenience  language related matters and other factors which may determine where a consumer will purchase products 
the company does not believe at this time that the introduction of the euro will have any significant long term adverse impact on the pricing for the company s products or require a significant modification to the company s accounting systems

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
systemax attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing certain derivative financial instruments 
the value of the us dollar affects the company s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect systemax s sales as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings 
the company may engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts  systemax  from time to time  hedges certain of its assets that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  may impact the statement of consolidated income 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets  availability of hedging instruments and the credit worthiness of the parties which have entered into such contracts with the company 
all currency contracts that are entered into by systemax are for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculative or trading purposes 
in spite of systemax s hedging efforts to reduce the effect of changes in exchange rates against the us dollar  the company s sales or costs could still be adversely affected by changes in those exchange rates 
as of december  the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts
