if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue allocable to support is recognized on a straight line basis over the periods in which the support is provided 
arrangements that include consulting services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement

maintenance and service revenue 
the company derives its maintenance and service revenue from support  consulting and training services provided to customers 
maintenance and service revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the growth of maintenance and service revenue in absolute dollars is primarily due to the renewal of maintenance contracts after the initial one year term and increased licensing activity  which has resulted in increased revenue from ancillary sources such as maintenance  support  training and consulting services 
although prior years licensing growth has resulted in increased revenue from maintenance and support  training and consulting services  the company expects that prior growth rates of the company s installed base and  consequently  in the company s service revenue  may not be sustainable in the future

research and development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to primarily relates to a smaller increase in research and development employee headcount of from to  compared to a increase from to research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from to primarily due to personnel costs associated with the increase in headcount 
the increases in research and development expenses in absolute dollar amounts in each successive year is primarily attributable to increased staffing  outside contractors and associated support for software engineers required to expand and enhance the company s product line 
the company believes that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future

the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was 
the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes  offset by tax exempt interest income and research and development tax credits 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in from and relates to a larger realization of the research and development tax credit and lower state taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively  of which net income was a significant component in each year 
in all three years  cash from operations was used to support the company s working capital requirements  as such requirements expanded  and in all three years the company experienced significant growth in receivables  accompanying the company s increased sales volumes  partially offset by growth in deferred revenue balances 
during  the company began investing in forward and simple purchase option contracts to hedge the risk associated with a newly implemented plan of multi currency invoicing 
cash used for simple purchase option contracts was approximately  for the year ended december  the company intends to continue to use forward and simple purchase option contracts to minimize the exposures to the united states dollar usd value of foreign currency denominated sales  and as non usd denominated international revenues increase  the cash used to purchase these option contracts may increase 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the company s net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and is primarily due to net short term investment purchases  cash used to acquire businesses as well as property and equipment expenditures

cash used to purchase property and equipment  primarily for computer workstations  capitalized internal use software  leasehold improvements and file servers for the company s growing employee base was million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
the company expects that the rate of purchases of property and equipment will continue to increase as the company s employee base grows 
the company s principal commitments consist primarily of leases on its facilities and its telephone system 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to million used by financing activities in and million provided by financing activities in this comparative increase of million from to is due to proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans netted with the repurchase of approximately  shares of common stock at a cost of million and capital lease principal payments of million during  compared with proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans netted with the repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of million and capital lease payments of million during the comparative decrease of million from to is primarily due to million less cash raised in from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans as well as the additional expenditure of million to repurchase shares of common stock 
on august   the board of directors board authorized management of the company to repurchase up to million shares or approximately percent of the company s outstanding shares of common stock over the next twelve months 
on august   the board authorized the company to continue the share repurchase program for an additional six months through february the company has purchased the shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions

as of december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of the company s stock at an average price of for approximately million 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million of working capital 
the company believes that its current cash and short term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash 
in addition  the company may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
consequently  significant future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  which was subsequently amended by statement no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of sfas to require adoption of sfas in years beginning after june  the statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings 
if the derivative qualifies as a hedge  depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flow is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized in earnings 
the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter 
the company adopted sfas during the quarter ended september  and subsequently implemented a hedging program related to multi currency invoicing 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain aspects of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company believes that its current revenue recognition principles comply with sab factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as increased competition  the timing of new product announcements and changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  the size and timing of significant orders  the mix of direct and indirect sales  changes in operating expenses  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and general economic factors 
the company operates with no significant order backlog because its software products typically are shipped or electronically downloaded over the web shortly after orders are received 
furthermore  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter  with this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks of a quarter 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
product revenue is also difficult to forecast because the market for software products is rapidly evolving  and the company s sales cycle  from initial trial to multiple copy purchases and the provision of support services  varies substantially from customer to customer 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because a proportionately smaller amount of the company s expenses varies with its revenue 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on new products and rapid technological change  risk of product bugs 
the client server and web based application software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
in  the company invested significant resources into the research and development  sales and marketing of software applications 
the company is continuing to invest heavily in these efforts in there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and customer requirements  or that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if the new products currently being developed by the company do not achieve market acceptance or are not released when expected  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its new products and enhancements after their introduction and has experienced delays or lost revenue during the period required to correct these errors 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such errors to date  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of growth  dependence upon key personnel 
the company has recently experienced a period of significant growth that has placed a strain upon its management systems and resources 
the company recently implemented a number of new financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employee work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s current executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical  sales and managerial employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
international operations 
international sales represented approximately of the company s revenue in the company currently has eleven international wholly owned subsidiaries  which are primarily sales offices  and are located in the united kingdom  canada  germany  france  spain  italy  the netherlands  sweden  singapore  australia and japan 
one of the company s strategies is to continue to expand its existing international operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
traditionally  international operations are characterized by higher operating expenses and lower operating margins 
as a result  if international revenues increase as a percentage of total revenue  operating margins may be adversely affected 
costs associated with international expansion include the establishment of additional foreign offices  the hiring of additional personnel  the localization and marketing of its products for particular foreign markets and the development of relationships with additional international service providers 
if international revenue is not adequate to offset the expense of expanding foreign operations  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s international operations are subject to other risks inherent in international business activities and generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  product acceptance in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and general economic conditions in such countries 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial majority of the company s international sales are indirect  any material increase in the company s international sales as a percentage of total revenue may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
product concentration 
the company currently derives the majority of its revenue from licenses of the ar system  the applications remedy provides  which are built upon the ar system foundation  and related services 
broad market acceptance of the company s products is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  a decline in demand for or failure to achieve broad market acceptance of the ar system foundation and applications as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the ar system foundation and other applications  specifically ecrm and ebusiness infrastructure management applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the ar system or any new or enhanced products or applications 
in  the company invested significant resources into the research and development  sales and marketing of new software applications 
however  the company believes that its success in expanding its product line will depend largely on new products achieving market acceptance and technological competitiveness 
expansion of indirect channels 
an integral part of the company s strategy is to continue to develop the marketing channels of value added resellers vars  system integrators sis and independent software vendors isvs 
vars  sis and isvs accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in if these marketing channels increase as a percentage of sales  the company s operating margins may be adversely affected due to the lower unit prices that the company receives when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract vars  sis and isvs that will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
in addition  the company s agreements with vars  sis and isvs are not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause  and many of the company s vars  sis and isvs carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any var  si or isv will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit  or the loss of important vars  sis or isvs could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company intends to rely on third party implementation providers  including integration consulting firms and remedy approved consultants racs  to assist with the implementation of its products in large enterprise customers and in the training of personnel within such enterprises  in order to meet the demand for implementation of the company s product from large enterprise customers 
as it is the company s strategy to increase its sales to enterprise customers and to use third party service providers to service such customers  the company s operating margins may be lower as a result of the higher expenses associated with engaging such third party service providers 
euro conversion 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the changes in europe aimed at forming a european economic and monetary union emu 
on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
on that day  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries and over the next three years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
no later than july   the participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies  so that the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions  making the conversion to the euro complete 
the company recognizes that by january   all its customers in the participating countries in europe will need to have converted all the values in their databases to the euro  having previously reflected all values in the appropriate local currencies 
at this time  it is not possible to summarize the potential costs associated with addressing any euro conversion issues and there can be no assurance that these issues and their related costs will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial position 
however  based on progress to date  the company believes that the use of the euro will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business 
accordingly  conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
general economic and market conditions 
during recent years  segments of the personal computer industry have experienced significant economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  production over capacity  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs 
the company s operations may in the future experience substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of such industry patterns  general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers and other factors affecting capital spending 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
the company presently has two patent applications pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap out of the box or off the shelf sales and click wrap electronic sales transmitted via the internet licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  it is possible that such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product liability 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap out of the box or off the shelf sales and click wrap electronic sales transmitted via the internet licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  it is possible that such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
for these and other reasons  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
from time to time the company may acquire or invest in companies  technologies or products that complement the company s business or its product offerings 
any such acquisitions may result in the use of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of software development costs or other assets  incurrence of severance liabilities  the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or the incurrence of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
acquisitions involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of the company s business  and the entry into markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience 
in addition  potential acquisition candidates targeted by the company may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information or any degree of internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to any successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including with respect to revenues  expenses  liabilities  contingent or otherwise  and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with selling to large enterprise customers 
the company has recently increased its efforts to sell its products to large enterprise customers  and has devoted significant management and financial resources to achieving this goal 
if successful  large enterprise customers are expected to deploy the company s products in business critical operations which involve significant capital and management commitments by such customers 
potential large enterprise customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and require the company to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of the company s solutions 
sales of the company s products to such customers require an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to purchase such products generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including factors over which the company has little or no control  may cause potential large enterprise customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
as a result of these or other factors  the sales cycle for the company s products is long  typically ranging between three and nine months 
as a result of the length of the sales cycle and the significant selling expenses resulting from selling into the large enterprise  the company s ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions to which the company has devoted significant resources could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition and could cause significant variations in the company s operating results from quarter to quarter 
limited operating history  future operating results uncertain  need to increase sales force 
the company was incorporated in november and began shipping products in december although the company has experienced significant absolute dollar growth in revenue in recent years  there can be no assurance that the prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future operating results or that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including the demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the company s success in expanding its direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and control costs  and the percentage of the company s revenue derived from indirect channels  which may have lower gross margins than direct sales 
in particular  the company intends to hire a significant number of additional sales personnel in and beyond  which is required if the company is to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified sales persons in the future 
the company increased the size of its sales organization from to in  from to in and from to in in the past  the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified sales persons 
if the company is unable to hire such personnel on a timely basis  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected

as stated in its policy  the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting issuer risk  default risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
the company limits issuer risk by placing its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company mitigates default and liquidity risks by investing in only high credit quality securities and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity

the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe 
as some revenues are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company will be subject to the risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month period 
beginning in october  the company began invoicing in currencies other than us dollars  and as a result  the company has entered into hedging activities in order to minimize the exposure of the united states dollar usd value of foreign currency denominated sales 
in the future  more of the company s revenues may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars and  as a result  the company s exposure in the future may fluctuate depending upon the nature and success of the hedging activities 
accordingly  due to the substantial volatility of foreign exchange rates  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected
