overview fiscal year was the first year in which the company fully benefited from the sale of its under performing subsidiary in the united kingdom 
sales were strong in fiscal year  with both canada and australia posting double digit comparable store sales gains in all four quarters 
importantly  this sales improvement was sustained to the operating income line which showed an improvement  on a comparable basis  of approximately 
there were a number of special factors and charges in fiscal years and that significantly impacted the company s results of operations and affected the comparability of the reported results with other periods

segment reporting disclosures the company s business is managed along geographic lines 
all references to canada  australia  corporate headquarters and the united kingdom refer to the company s reportable segments  unless otherwise noted 
transactions between operating segments are not common and are not material to the segment information 
summarized in the table below are the net sales and operating revenues  operating income loss  and assets for the company s reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june    and year ended june in thousands net sales and operating revenues canada    australia    united kingdom   operating income loss canada    australia    united kingdom   corporate headquarters    operating income    foreign currency transaction gains losses interest income    interest expense   income loss before income tax   assets canada    australia    united kingdom  corporate headquarters    the company sold its united kingdom subsidiary in january and recognized a loss of  accordingly  the company s operating results in the united kingdom reflect only six months of operation and the loss on sale 
reflects a charge of  associated with the closure of unprofitable stores 
sales outlets the geographic distribution of the company s sales outlets is summarized in the following table year ended june canada company operated dealer australia company operated dealer united kingdom company operated dealer total company operated dealer in addition  the company operated  and stores on behalf of cantel during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dealers included in the preceding table are independent retail businesses which operate under their own trade names but are permitted  under dealer agreements  to purchase any of the products sold by intertan company stores 
the dealer agreements contain a license permitting the dealer to designate the consumer electronics department of the dealer s business as a radioshack dealer or a tandy dealer  as applicable 
sales to dealers accounted for approximately of sales in canada and australia during fiscal years and in fiscal year  dealers sales accounted for approximately of consolidated sales 
the decrease in the number of dealers in australia  in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a program designed to eliminate dealers that were not purchasing product in sufficient quantities to make them profitable to the company 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities to expand its dealer base in both countries to produce profitable sales from communities too small to support company operated stores 
the company has entered into an agreement in canada with cantel to operate rogers at t telecommunications stores on its behalf 
at june   stores were in operation 
under the terms of this agreement  cantel leases the stores and is responsible for fixed costs  including rent and realty taxes 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of product from these locations and also receives an activation commission from cantel 
the level of commission received is usually lower than for identical product sold from the company s own stores 
since these locations are not company owned  they are not included in the above table 
intertan s business is seasonal  sales peak in the november december holiday selling season 
the company s cash flow requirements are also seasonal since inventories build prior to the holiday selling season 
significant inventory growth for all operations typically begins to build in late summer and peaks in november 
profit and loss accounts  including sales  are translated from local currency values to us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates 
the impact of fluctuations of local country currencies against the us dollar can be significant 
during fiscal year  both the canadian and australian dollars were stronger on average against the us dollar than they were in fiscal year as a result  the same local currency amounts translate into more us dollars as compared with the prior year 
for example  if local currency sales in canada in fiscal year were equal to those in fiscal year  the fiscal year income statement would reflect a increase in sales when reported in us dollars 
the following table outlines the percentage change in the weighted average exchange rates of the currencies of canada  australia and the united kingdom relative to the us dollar as compared to the prior year 
year ended june percentage change canada australia united kingdom represents the weighted average exchange rate for the first six months of fiscal year compared to the same period in the prior year 
net sales and operating revenues when the sales of the company s former subsidiary in the united kingdom are removed from last year s sales  the combined sales of the canadian and australian segments showed an increase in sales in us dollars of  or 
this sales comparison was affected by foreign currency fluctuations  primarily a stronger canadian dollar 
the increase  measured at the same exchange rates  was and comparable store sales increased by 
the effect of new stores on this growth was not significant  as the number of company operated stores grew by only 
the year over year sales comparison benefited from strong dealer sales  in particular in canada where dealer sales increased in local currency by  and from increases in revenue streams such as volume based bonuses and residuals  which are not credited to individual stores 
the following table illustrates the total percentage sales increase decrease by segment area as measured in us dollars and local currencies 
us dollars year ended june percentage change canada australia united kingdom local currencies year ended june canada australia united kingdom results for the united kingdom segment for fiscal year only include sales for the first six months of the year 
the following table illustrates the percentage change in comparative company operated store sales  measured at comparable exchange rates 
year ended june percentage change canada australia united kingdom consolidated derived from the accumulation of each store s monthly sales in local currency for those months in which it was open both in the current and preceding year 
includes results for the united kingdom only for the first six months of the year 
sales in both countries were strong throughout the year  with each country posting a double digit comparable store sales gain in all four quarters of the year 
combined comparable store sales in canada and australia increased by and in fiscal years and  respectively 
in canada  the sales growth was broadly based  with gains being achieved in most major core categories 
sales of direct to home satellite systems increased by over  as the company has become a destination of choice for consumers who wish to buy this popular product 
penetration of this product in the market place is low and management expects that further sales gains will be achieved in fiscal year wireless products continue to be popular with consumers and the company increased revenues in this category by over 
growth in these two categories satellite and wireless is important  as they both have the potential to produce after sale income streams in the form of residuals or sales based volume bonuses 
the audio video category also performed well with a sales increase of over 
the strong performance in this category is demonstrative of the success of the company s store in store panasonic fixture 
tests consistently show that stores with this fixture outperform other stores 
during fiscal year  this fixture was rolled out to company operated stores 
further growth in this category is expected during fiscal year as the panasonic fixture will be rolled out to an additional stores 
sales of computer accessories and software increased by over as the company offered a broader and deeper assortment of these products 
although introduced in the canadian market too late in the year to have a meaningful impact on sales in the communications category  sales of the newly approved family radio service frs were very strong in may and june 
management expects frs to significantly improve the communications category in fiscal year sales growth in australia was more narrowly focused  with gains concentrated in a few key categories 
fiscal year saw the roll out of a new strategy for personal computers  with a wider range of models available in more of the company s stores 
this strategy was successful in producing a sales gain in that category of over 
sales of cpu s and monitors were also used to drive the sale of computer accessories  which grew by over 
merchandise assortment enhancements in the video category began to drive significant sales and profit increases during q  and that trend is continuing into q of fiscal fiscal year was a difficult year for cellular in australia 
as the analog system was eliminated at the end of calendar year  many of the late adopters to digital were infrequent users who opted to purchase the cheaper and less profitable prepaid models 
competition intensified in the distribution channel  putting pressure on both pricing and margins 
in response to these market forces  management has decided to expand its cellular product offering in australia by adding two new carriers orange and vodafone to its existing partnership with optus 
while sales of prepaid models will continue to be significant  management believes that this new strategy  involving innovative new cdma based services unlike any offered in north america currently  as well as the rollout of a gprs wap network will increase sales of higher yield contract phones 
sales growth in canada was also broadly based in fiscal year sales growth was most evident in the wireless and computer categories  reflecting not only the emphasis placed on these categories  but also strong consumer demand 
in wireless  the performance of the rogers at t stores was a major contributor to growth  with those stores producing an overall sales gain of over  despite a reduction in the store count of over 
direct to home satellite also played an important part in canada s sales growth for the year 
the company s focus on the telephone and battery categories continued to deliver strongly on the sales line 
the growth in sales in australia in fiscal year was also broadly based  with increases experienced in almost all product categories 
sales of computers were particularly strong 
in the wireless category  introduction of the prepaid cellular telephone into the australian market resulted in sales growth  both of handsets and related airtime cards 
sales of subscriber based digital cellular were also strong  as the government planned to substantially shut down the analog system at the end of sales gains in batteries and telephones also contributed to overall sales growth in australia 
sales in the united kingdom segment for the first six months of fiscal year decreased by compared to the same period in fiscal year this reduction was more than attributable to the closure of unprofitable stores in the third quarter of fiscal year comparable stores sales increased by 
however  unlike canada and australia  sales growth in the united kingdom was narrowly focused  with only wireless communications showing meaningful improvement 
the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom was sold in january see sale of united kingdom subsidiary and other restructuring charges 
comparative stores sales increased during fiscal year as a whole by  with increases being experienced in all four quarters 
the company s strategy for building sales throughout fiscal year was to actively pursue the growth opportunities presented by certain key categories with high consumer demand and which fit the company s market niche 
targeted product categories included cellular  telephones and accessories  in particular cordless models  computers  personal electronics and  in canada  direct to home satellite systems 
the success of this strategy was particularly evident in canada and australia during the second half of the year where these promotional efforts produced gains in a wide range of product categories 
sales efforts also continued to focus on the important parts and accessories category in all three of the company s markets 
gross profit the canadian and australian segments combined to produce an increase in gross profit  measured in us dollars  of 
measured at the same exchange rates  gross profit in canada and australia increased by 
the following analysis summarizes the components of the change in the gross profit from the prior year change in in thousands gross profit higher sales in canada and australia  lower gross margin percentage in canada and australia  foreign currency rate effects  effect of sale of united kingdom subsidiary  the following table illustrates gross profit as a percentage of sales  by segment area year ended june as a percentage of sales canada australia united kingdom consolidated represents the gross margin percentage in the united kingdom for the first six months of fiscal year the combined gross margin percentages for canada and australia for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
in canada and australia  the gross margin percentages in fiscal years  and all come under pressure as management pursued a planned strategy of transforming the company from a niche retailer of primarily private label end products and  parts and accessories into a dynamic retailer of state of the art  high tech and primarily branded products 
this strategy impacted the gross margin percentage in three ways 
management has embarked on a strategy specifically designed to evaluate product opportunities and assortments based on its belief that shareholder value is best served by placing the pursuit of incremental gross profit dollars and improvements in operating margin as paramount in importance 
accordingly  the company has developed and implemented strategic alliances with key national and international brands 

margins within product categories declined as nationally branded product replaced higher margin private label goods 

overall margins declined as sales of certain popular products  including computers  wireless and  in canada  home satellite  increased at a rate disproportionate to the overall increase in sales 
these products generally carry margins that are below the company s average 
the impact of the third of these factors was particularly noticeable in australia during fiscal year  as the percentage of computers and related accessories in the overall sales mix increased by almost 
a shift in the wireless business in australia away from more profitable contract plans to prepaid airtime models was also a factor 
during fiscal year  a writedown of inventories in connection with the store closure program had a negative effect on margins in the united kingdom 
it has been  and will continue to be  management s policy to pursue opportunities for profitable sales growth ie  growth which will yield increases in gross profit dollars that exceed incremental selling  general and administrative expenses 
management believes that a modest reduction in the gross margin percentage will continue into fiscal year as customers continue to demand the latest in digital technology 
these are typically lower margin  but nevertheless profitable  products 
in addition  while these products initially carry below company average margins  many offer opportunities to generate after sale revenues in the form of residuals  and sale based bonuses 
management believes these future revenue streams will partially mitigate the margin decline 
in addition  many of these products present opportunities to sell related  and more profitable  parts and accessories 
goods and services tax australia effective july   australia moved from a wholesale based sales tax system to a goods and services tax or gst a system much like a european value added tax 
under the present system  the tax is included in the retailer s cost 
the rate ranges from to  depending on the class of goods 
management estimates that the weighted average tax included in the company s inventory in australia to be about 
the retailer recovers this tax by factoring it into the selling prices 
it is important to note that the wholesale tax is a tax on the retailer not the consumer 
the consumer ultimately pays through a higher retail price 
this wholesale based tax was replaced by the gst effective july  under the gst  instead of the retailer paying a tax on cost  the consumer will now pay a tax on the selling price of the goods 
the rate will be and  with one or two exceptions  will apply to all goods and services 
for the retailer  this means a reduction in cost of goods sold  since it no longer pays the sales tax 
however  it will also mean lower revenues  as the government has mandated that this tax saving must be passed on to the consumer ie  the retailer cannot increase gross profit dollars as a result of the change 
the following is a brief summary of how this tax change will affect intertan in australia 
reported sales will decline  as the old sales tax is removed from the selling price 
management estimates that reported sales in the company s stores will be reduced by about 
the company will  however  report comparable stores sales on a consistent basis by making a corresponding adjustment to the prior years sales on a pro forma basis 

cost of goods sold will also decline  as the old sales tax is excluded from cost 

management estimates that the gross margin percentage will increase by about percentage points  as the tax is excluded from both sales and cost of goods 

importantly  the impact on gross profit dollars and operating income will be neutral 

management estimates that the carrying value of inventories will decline by about 

there will also be a short term cash flow benefit  as sales tax currently in inventory will be refunded over a period of months 
generally speaking  whether or not the consumer will pay more or less for a particular item on a tax included basis will depend primarily on the gross margin associated with the product 
the all in price of low ticket  high margin items such as parts and accessories will go up  while the price for higher ticket  lower margin goods such as branded telephones  televisions and digital cameras will fall 
with the company s current sales mix  management projects that prices will be slightly lower  on average  across the product range 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table provides a breakdown of selling  general and administrative expense sg a by major category sg a expense by category in thousands dollars of sales dollars of sales dollars of sales payroll    advertising    rent    taxes other than income tax    telephone and utlities    other    the reduction in sg a expenses during fiscal year is more than explained by the sale of the united kingdom subsidiary  which had the effect of reducing sg a expense by  in us dollars  sg a expense in canada  australia and corporate headquarters increased by  measured at the same exchange rates  sg a expense in these three segments increased by 
this compares to increases of and in sales and gross profit dollars  respectively 
the following is a breakdown of the increases in s a expense in canada  australia and at corporate headquarters during fiscal year increase  measured increase  at the same foreign currency measured in in thousands exchange rates effects us dollars payroll    advertising   rent   taxes other than income taxes  telephone and utilities other   payroll increased in both canada and australia in support of higher sales and included increases in commissions  bonuses and other performance based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in compensation costs at corporate headquarters  where expenses in the prior year included costs related to management transition and the relocation of that office to canada 
rent has increased partially as a result of a net increase in the store count and in part as a result of routine rent reviews 
advertising exposures increased as the company has increased its media presence  both in terms of flyers and newspaper inserts  and television 
the following table illustrates sg a expenses as a percentage of sales  by geographic segment area as a percentage of sales canada australia united kingdom based on sales and sg a expenses for the first six months of fiscal year the sale of the former united kingdom subsidiary also more than explained the reduction in sg a expense during fiscal year when the effects of united kingdom sg a expenses are eliminated  canada  australia and corporate headquarters posted an increase in s a expense  measured at the same exchange rates  of  substantially less than the increase in sales and gross profit dollars 
as was the case in fiscal year  payroll increased in support of stronger sales and rents increased  primarily as a result of on going rent reviews 
sg a expenses also increased as a result of the scheduled increase in the royalty payable to radioshack usa from to its maximum rate of 
foreign exchange rate effects more than explained the apparent reduction in sg a spending during fiscal year measured at the same exchange rates  sg a expenses increased by approximately 
spending increased in canada and australia  primarily on sales driven expenditures such as payroll 
increases in the overall store count in both countries and the completion of the roll out of the rogers at t program in canada also accounted for increases in rent 
the scheduled increase in the royalty payable to tandy as well as higher sales contributed to the increase  with increases being experienced in all three countries 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased in fiscal year by  this reduction is more than explained by the sale of the former united kingdom subsidiary 
depreciation expense in canada and australia increased reflecting additional investment in stores  including remodelling and fixture enhancements 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  during fiscal year  primarily as a result of the sale of the united kingdom subsidiary and foreign currency effects 
in fiscal year  depreciation and amortization decreased by  this reduction primarily resulted from lower depreciation in the united kingdom following an asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal year to writedown the store assets in that country to their estimated fair value 
loss on sale of united kingdom subsidiary and other restructuring charges during fiscal year  the company s board of directors approved a plan to sell the company s investment in intertan uk limited for proceeds of  net of estimated selling costs and the company recorded a loss of  the sale included all assets  liabilities and other obligations of the united kingdom subsidiary  including approximately  of bank debt outstanding under intertan uk limited s portion of the company s syndicated loan agreement which was repaid by the purchaser at closing 
see segment reporting disclosures  for revenue and operating income loss associated with intertan uk limited 
in addition  the purchaser assumed the rights to claim tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax deductions having a potential tax benefit of approximately  to the extent the purchaser is able to utilize all or a portion of these loss carryforwards and other deferred tax deductions  the company is entitled to cash payments equal to of the tax savings realized by the purchaser a maximum of approximately 
the company will recognize such proceeds  if any  as received 
no such proceeds have been received to date 
also under the terms of the sale agreement  the company has indemnified the purchaser for certain contingencies  primarily relating to working capital adjustments 
in addition  the company remains contingently liable as guarantor of certain leases of intertan uk limited 
at june   the lease obligation assumed by the purchaser and guaranteed by the company was approximately  and the average remaining life of such leases was approximately years 
if the purchaser were to default on the lease obligations  management believes the company could reduce the exposure through assignment  subletting and other means 
the company has obtained an indemnity from the purchaser for an amount equal to management s best estimate of the company s exposure  if any  under these guarantees 
the amount of this indemnity declines over time as the company s risk diminishes 
at june   the amount of this indemnity was approximately  costs  if any  resulting from these contingencies will be recorded as incurred  or become probable and estimable 
in january a plan to close consistently under performing stores in the united kingdom was approved 
in connection with this restructuring plan  a provision of  was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year  reflecting lease disposal costs  severance costs and other closure costs  including fixture removal and contract termination costs 
foreign currency transaction gains losses a foreign currency transaction loss of  occurred during fiscal year foreign currency transaction gains of  and  occurred during fiscal year and  respectively 
these gains and losses resulted from a variety of factors  including the effect of fluctuating foreign currency values on certain inter company debt and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the debtor 
in fiscal years and  the company s major exposure to foreign currency risks was the canadian dollar denominated subordinated convertible debentures the debentures that were designated as a hedge against the company s net investment in its canadian subsidiary 
foreign exchange gains and losses on the debentures for fiscal years and are included in other comprehensive income 
as at june   all of the debentures had been converted to the company s common stock 
interest income and expense interest income was   and  during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increases in interest income are reflective of the company s continuing improved cash position and  to a lesser extent  higher rates in fiscal year management does not expect significant improvement in interest income during fiscal year as much of the company s cash resources have been directed to the stock re purchase program 
interest expense during fiscal year declined by  this reduction reflects the conversion of the debentures as well as reduced borrowing costs following the sale of the former united kingdom subsidiary 
these two factors also contributed to a reduction in the interest expense of  during fiscal year another factor contributing to the fiscal year reduction was the repayment of a note payable to radioshack usa in december  interest expense in fiscal year declined by  reflecting the effects of scheduled repayments of the note payable to radioshack usa as well as the early retirement of that debt 
income taxes historically  the company s high effective income tax rate has been attributable to a number of factors  including 
losses in the untied kingdom and interest expense on the debentures for which no tax benefit was available  
certain corporate headquarters expenditures which cannot be deducted by the operating subsidiaries 
with the sale of the united kingdom subsidiary and the repayment of the debentures  management expects that the effective tax rate for fiscal year will be more representative of future rates 
the provision for taxes in fiscal years  and includes a provision for canadian and australian taxes on the profits of the company earned in those countries 
the fiscal year provision also included a charge of  related to the settlement of a dispute with the canadian tax authorities relating to the to taxation years which is discussed more fully below 
the company was advised that following an audit of the income tax returns of the company s canadian subsidiary for the to taxation years  revenue canada was challenging certain interest deductions relating to the canadian subsidiary s former operations in continental europe and was proposing to tax certain foreign exchange gains related to such operations 
the company previously estimated that it could potentially have an additional liability of up to  relating to these issues 
in march  the company and revenue canada agreed to a resolution of this matter which will result in a liability to the company of approximately  resulting in a charge of  reflecting a settlement which exceeded management s expectations  but was substantially less than the maximum exposure of  an audit of the income tax returns of the canadian subsidiary for the to taxation years was completed during fiscal year  resulting in additional tax being levied against the canadian subsidiary 
the company has appealed these reassessments and  pending the outcome of these matters  the company  by canadian law  was required to pay a portion of the tax in dispute 
the tax levied by revenue canada in reassessing those years was offset by refunds arising from the carryback of losses incurred in subsequent years 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these issues  the company could potentially have an additional liability in the range of to  the company believes it has meritorious arguments in defense of the issues raised by revenue canada and it is in the process of vigorously defending its position 
it is management s determination that no additional provision need be recorded for these reassessments 
it is not practical for management to make any reasonable determination of when this remaining outstanding canadian tax issue will ultimately be resolved 
an audit of the company s canadian subsidiary s income tax returns by revenue canada for the taxation years is in process 
audits of the company s united states income tax returns for the years by the internal revenue service the irs were completed during the company has been advised that the irs alleges that the company owes additional taxes in respect of those years 
the issues involved related primarily to the company s former operations in continental europe and the united kingdom 
the company disagrees with the irs s position on these issues and believes it has meritorious arguments in its defense 
the company has filed a protest rebutting the assertions made by the irs and is in the process of vigorously defending its position 
management believes that it has a provision recorded sufficient to pay the estimated liability resulting from the issues in dispute  however  the amount ultimately paid could differ from management s estimate 
earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted 
with the conversion of the debentures during fiscal year  the company s only remaining dilutive instruments are the options to purchase common stock held by the company s directors and employees 
at june   the company s directors and employees held options to purchase  common shares at prices ranging from to per share 
all but  of such options were included in the computation of diluted earning s per common share for fiscal year these options were excluded because the option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common stock during the third and fourth quarters 
the dilutive effect of the various options held by the company s directors and employees in future periods will depend on the average market price of the company s common stock during such periods 
for illustrative purposes  using a market price of as an average would result in approximately  shares being included in weighted average common shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities generated  in cash during fiscal year net income  adjusted for non cash items  generated  in cash 
increased inventory levels in support of higher sales consumed  in cash  however  the effects of this increase were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased by  reflecting the fact that a greater portion of the company s revenue comes from vendors in the form of wireless activation income  residuals and volume rebates 
the payment of income taxes  consumed  in cash  primarily because the final payment of fiscal year taxes exceeded instalments paid during the year 
in addition  the canadian subsidiary has not yet been fully reassessed by the canadian tax authorities for the settlement agreed to in fiscal year see income taxes 
management estimates that the final amount of this reassessment will be approximately  operating activities generated  in cash during fiscal year net income  adjusted for non cash items  generated  in cash 
increased inventory levels consumed  in cash 
increased sales  in particular of wireless products  as well as increased vendor advertising support also contributed to an increase in accounts receivable of  the deferral of tax instalments preserved  in cash as final fiscal tax payments are not due until after year end 
operating activities generated  in cash during fiscal year net income  adjusted for non cash items  produced  in cash 
a reduction in inventory levels contributed a further  in cash 
the deferral of income tax instalments conserved a further  in cash during fiscal year investing activities consumed  in cash during fiscal year  primarily related to capital expenditures in the canadian and australian segments 
the level of expenditures is higher than in fiscal years and as the company accelerated the pace at which stores are remodelled or refitted to a new format in both canada and australia and invested in additional information systems  in particular in australia 
investing activities consumed  in cash during fiscal year capital expenditures  primarily on store fixtures and office equipment  required  in cash 
in addition  the sale of the company s former subsidiary in the united kingdom consumed  in cash  representing the cash balances of that company at the time of sale less the net proceeds of disposition 
however  the subsidiary also had approximately  of short term bank debt which was assumed and repaid by the purchaser 
investing activities consumed  in cash during fiscal year this cash outflow result for the most part from additions to property and equipment  primarily relating to opening new stores  renovating existing stores and upgrading information systems 
cash flows from financing activities consumed  in cash during fiscal year in november   the company s board of directors announced a share repurchase program under which management was authorized to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock over a period of three years 
as a result of unanticipated market conditions  the repurchase program was accelerated  and by march   all  shares had been acquired 
in april   the company announced that the board of directors had authorized a further program for the repurchase of up to  additional shares 
by june    shares had been acquired under this program 
the repurchase of common stock under these plans and other arrangements consumed  in cash 
this cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock to employee plans and from the exercise of stock options 
cash flow from financing activities generated  in cash during fiscal year short term bank borrowings in the united kingdom prior to its sale resulted in a cash inflow of  proceeds from the issuance of stock under the company s stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options by employees generated  and  respectively in additional cash 
during fiscal year  financing activities consumed  in cash 
repayment in full of loans from radioshack usa comprised the major component of the cash outflow 
a decrease in the level of short term borrowings in the united kingdom was also a contributing factor 
the effect of these reductions in cash resources was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employee plans

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks arising primarily from the impact of changes in interest rates on its short term credit facilities and from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as they relate to its investment  debt and activities in canada and australia 
foreign currency fluctuations the company s activities are carried on in foreign jurisdictions in canada and australia 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risks in three broad areas 
its inventory purchases  
translation of its financial results  and 
its net investment in foreign jurisdictions 
during fiscal year  the company s operating subsidiaries in canada and australia purchased approximately of their inventories in the far east 
these purchases are made in us dollars and  under the terms of its agreement with its suppliers  payment must be made at the time of shipment 
accordingly  there is risk that the value of the canadian and australian dollars  as the case may be  could fluctuate relative to the us dollar from the time the goods are ordered until shipment is made 
management monitors the foreign exchange risk associated with its us dollar open orders on a regular basis by reviewing the amount of such open orders  exchange rates  including forecasts from major financial institutions  local news and other economic factors  all on a country specific basis 
based on this input  management decides whether or not to lock in the cost of a portion of those orders in advance of delivery by purchasing forward exchange rate contracts to be settled on or near the estimated date of inventory delivery 
the table below shows the amount of open orders and forward exchange contracts on hand at june  and the financial impact which would result if the functional currency of the purchasing entities were to decline in value by relative to the us dollar from june  to the date of delivery 
in thousands june  june  open orders   impact of a decline in local currency values   foreign exchange contracts on hand   impact of a decline in local currency values net impact of a decline in local currency values   the incremental cost of such a decline in currency values  if incurred  would be reflected in higher cost of sales in future periods 
in these circumstances  management would take product pricing action  where appropriate 
translation of financial results the functional currencies of the company s operating entities in canada and australia are the respective local currencies 
however  the reporting currency of the company on a consolidated basis is the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the value of the canadian and australia dollars have a direct effect on reported consolidated results 
it is not possible for management to effectively hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
the following table shows the combined sales and operating income loss for fiscal years and excluding the effects of the company s former subsidiary in the united kingdom and the effect that a decline in local currency values would have had on those results in thousands year ended june  effect of a decline in currency us dollars  in thousands as reported values sales canada   australia   operating income canada   australia  corporate expenses  year ended june  effect of a decline in currency us dollars  in thousands as reported values sales canada   australia   operating income canada   australia  corporate expenses  approximately  of the company s corporate expenses are paid in canadian dollars 
net investment in foreign jurisdictions the company s net investments in canada and australia are recorded in us dollars at the respective period end rates 
changes in these rates will have a direct effect on the carrying value of these investments 
the cumulative effect of such currency fluctuations is recorded in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company s convertible subordinated debenture was denominated in us dollars and was recorded in the books of the parent 
this instrument was designated as a partial hedge against the risk associated with the company s investment in its canadian subsidiary 
with the conversion of this instrument during fiscal year  this hedge no longer exists 
the company currently has no plans to hedge its investment in either canada or australia 
the following table shows the company s net investment in each of its operating entities and its expressed in us dollars at june  the table also shows the effect on those amounts if each local currency were to lose of its value against the us dollar in thousands june  june  effect of a effect of a decline in decline in currency currency net investment values net investment values canada     australia     short term interest rates the company s credit facilities include syndicated banking facilities in canada and a separate facility in australia 
these banking arrangements  which are used primarily to finance inventory purchases  provide for interest on any short term borrowings at rates determined with reference to the local prime or base rates 
these rates are  therefore  subject to change for a variety of reasons which are beyond the company s control 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources which is incorporated herein by reference 
neither the company nor its canadian and australian subsidiaries incurred any borrowings during fiscal year it has not been the company s policy to hedge against the risk presented by possible fluctuations in short term interest rates
