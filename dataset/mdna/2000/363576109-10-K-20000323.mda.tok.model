item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies have a material effect on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are primarily based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and generally follow premium levels 
for more than a decade  lower premium rates have prevailed among property casualty insurance carriers resulting in heavy competition for market share 
this soft market ie  lower premium rates has generally resulted in flat or reduced renewal commissions 
in recent years insured losses have reached into the billions of dollars 
substantial mergers  both domestically and internationally  have resulted in fewer insurance companies 
increased underwriting losses and reduced competition tend to raise premium rates 
historically  increased property replacement costs and increasingly large litigation awards have caused some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
these factors generally have the effect of generating higher premiums to clients and higher commissions to gallagher 
in spite of these forces  there have been mitigating factors including a favorable equity market  increased underwriting capital and improved economies of scale following consolidations  all of which tend to lower premium rates 
the net result is that property casualty premium rates have remained low 
although the insurance marketplace has seen pockets of premium rate increases  management believes that competitive conditions will continue and overall premium pricing will remain under pressure and not improve significantly in in recent years  lower rates of inflation and the soft market have resulted in a highly competitive insurance marketplace and flat to lower premiums 
in general  the downward trend in premium rates has had a greater effect on gallagher s revenues than inflation 
although the property casualty insurance pricing environment has resulted in some risk buyers returning to first dollar coverage  management believes the overall trend will be to continue to move toward the alternative insurance market  which would tend to have a favorable effect on our risk management services segment 
gallagher anticipates that new sales in the areas of risk management  claims management  insurance captive and self insurance services will continue to be a major factor in gallagher s fee revenue growth during gallagher continues to look to the future and to explore not only the core segments of insurance brokerage and risk management services  but also expansion within the alternative insurance markets and financial and related investment services 
management believes these areas continue to hold opportunities for diversification and profitable growth 
results of operations consolidated gallagher s results of operations for periods prior to have been restated for six acquisitions as if they had operated as part of gallagher prior to the date of merger 
gallagher continues to search for merger partners who complement existing operations  provide entry into new markets  add new products and enhance local sales and service capabilities 
for the effect of these restatements  in the aggregate  on year to year comparisons  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commission revenues increased by million or in this increase  generated by the insurance brokerage services segment  is the result of new business production partially offset by lost business 
commission revenues increased by million or in this increase is the result of new business production partially offset by lost business 
fee revenues increased by million or in this increase  generated primarily from the risk management services segment  resulted from strong new business production of million and favorable retention rates on existing business partially offset by lost business of million 
fee revenues increased by million or in this increase  also generated primarily from risk management services  resulted from new business production of million and favorable retention rates on existing business partially offset by lost business of million 
investment income and other increased by million or in this increase is due primarily to higher returns on funds invested with outside fund managers which were positively affected by robust equity markets during and a gain of million recognized in which resulted from the sale of a portion of gallagher s interests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects 
in  investment income and other decreased million or due primarily to lower returns on funds invested with outside fund managers which were adversely affected by volatility in global equity markets during in addition  gallagher liquidated a portion of its investment portfolio  thereby reducing the aggregate value of these portfolios by million during in  gallagher recognized non recurring pretax gains of million on the sale of underperforming or geographically undesirable operations and million on a real estate transaction in the united kingdom 
there were no material non recurring pretax gains of this nature recorded in either or salaries and employee benefits increased by million or in due primarily to a increase in employee head count  salary increases and the annualized effect of prior year new hires along with a corresponding increase in employee benefit expenses 
in  salaries and employee benefits increased by million or due to salary increases  the annualized effect of prior year new hires  a increase in employee head count and the impact of a million non recurring gain recognized in from the settlement of a defined benefit pension plan at one of gallagher s united kingdom subsidiaries 
other operating expenses increased by million or in and million or in these increases are due primarily to increases associated with travel  entertainment and temporary personnel costs for new business  technology upgrades  office consolidation expenses and commissions paid to sub brokers 
gallagher s effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
these rates are net of the effect of tax benefits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing and alternative energy projects  which are substantially offset by state and foreign taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gallagher s foreign operations recorded earnings before income taxes of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is due primarily to the write off of intangible assets associated with lost business 
the decrease in is due to the non recurring gains recognized in associated with the pension and real estate transactions mentioned above  substantially offset by growth in operating results generated by new business 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
gallagher s revenues vary from quarter to quarter generally as a result of the timing of policy inception dates which traditionally are heaviest in the third quarter 
expenses  on the other hand  are fairly uniform throughout the year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations segment information as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  gallagher has three operating business segments  insurance brokerage services  risk management services and financial services  as well as a corporate segment 
the insurance brokerage services segment includes gallagher s retail  reinsurance and wholesale brokerage operations

the financial services segment is responsible for gallagher s diversified investment portfolio which includes investment strategies trading  marketable securities available for sale  tax advantaged investments  investments accounted for using the equity method  real estate partnerships and notes receivable from investees 
revenues in were million or more than revenues in and earnings before income taxes increased million or over these increases are due primarily to more favorable returns on funds invested with outside fund managers and a gain of million recognized in which resulted from the sale of a portion of gallagher s interests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects 
revenues in decreased from and earnings before income taxes in decreased from these decreases relate to million and million of non recurring gains in revenues and earnings before income taxes  respectively  recognized in and less favorable returns on funds invested with outside fund managers due to equity market conditions in financial services revenues are generated principally in the united states 
corporate consists of unallocated administrative costs and the provision for income taxes which is not allocated to gallagher s operating entities 
revenues are not recorded in this segment and all costs are generated in the united states 
financial condition and liquidity the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive 
gallagher has historically been profitable  and cash flows from operations and short term borrowings under various credit agreements have been sufficient to fund operating  investment and capital expenditure needs of gallagher 
cash generated from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because of the variability related to the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable  net cash flows from operations vary substantially from year to year 
funds restricted as to gallagher s use  primarily premiums held as fiduciary funds  have not been included in determining gallagher s overall liquidity 
gallagher maintains a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement requiring repayment of any loans under the agreement no later than june  during  gallagher borrowed and repaid million of short term borrowings under the credit agreement 
during  gallagher borrowed and repaid million of short term borrowings under the credit agreement 
these borrowings were primarily used on a short term basis to finance a portion of gallagher s operations and expanded investment activity 
as of december  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants and gallagher is in compliance with these covenants 
gallagher also has three line of credit facilities which total million in the aggregate and expire on april  periodically  gallagher will make short term borrowings under these credit facilities to meet short term cash flow needs 
during and  gallagher borrowed and repaid million and million of short term borrowings  respectively  under these facilities 
as of december  and  million was outstanding under these facilities 
these borrowings were primarily used on a short term basis to finance a portion of gallagher s operations and expanded investment activity 
at december   gallagher has contingently committed to invest an additional million related to two letter of credit arrangements with one of its equity investments 
in addition  gallagher has guaranteed an aggregate million of funds through letters of credit or other arrangements related to several investments and insurance programs of gallagher 
gallagher paid million in cash dividends on its common stock in gallagher s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors and quarterly dividends are declared after considering gallagher s available cash from earnings and its known or anticipated cash needs 
in each quarter of  gallagher s board of directors declared a dividend of 
per share which was 
or greater than each quarterly dividend in in january  gallagher declared a first quarter dividend of 
per share  a increase over the first quarter dividend in net capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  gallagher expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures by gallagher are related primarily to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment 
in  gallagher adopted a plan that has been extended through june  to repurchase its common stock 
under the plan  gallagher repurchased  shares at a cost of million   shares at a cost of million and  shares at a cost of million in  and  respectively 
the repurchased shares are held for reissuance in connection with exercises of options under gallagher s stock option plans 
under the provisions of the plan  gallagher is authorized to repurchase approximately  additional shares through june  gallagher is under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and at its discretion may suspend the repurchase plan at any time 
effective with changes in the united states federal income tax laws in  gallagher no longer provides for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which are considered permanently invested outside the united states 
at december   gallagher had million of undistributed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although not considered available for domestic needs  the undistributed earnings generated by certain foreign subsidiaries referred to above may be used to finance foreign operations and acquisitions 
year computer programs that have time sensitive software may have recognized the date as the year  rather than the year  which could have resulted in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations the yk problem 
with respect to the yk problem  gallagher completed the necessary modifications or replacements of its existing software so that its computer systems would function properly in the year and beyond 
generally  these modifications and replacements and the associated costs were contemplated with normal enhancements and improvements being made in conjunction with updating financial reporting and operating systems 
it is estimated that gallagher spent less than million in the aggregate from through for specific yk fixes outside the routine efforts discussed above 
at the time of change from the year to the year and forward  gallagher has neither experienced major internal system failures nor been materially affected by compliance problems with the systems of business partners  vendors or clients 
gallagher believes it has successfully weathered any yk problems  but continues to monitor its internal systems and maintains an awareness of any problems which could arise with the systems of business partners  vendors or clients 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gallagher is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currrency exchange rates and equity prices 
gallagher does not enter into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following analysis presents the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by gallagher at december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analysis reflects gallagher s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to gallagher s consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks 
the effect of actual changes in these risk factors may differ materially from gallagher s estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  gallagher also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these are not included in the following analysis 
gallagher has a comprehensive and diversified investment portfolio 
gallagher s invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  investment strategies trading and marketable securities available for sale 
accordingly  these assets are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair value of gallagher s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december  and approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio 
the resulting fair value was not materially different from the carrying values at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of gallagher s investment strategies trading portfolio was million and million  respectively 
from an investment management perspective  this portfolio  which is managed by several outside fund managers  consists of two different components  an equity portfolio of million and million and an alternative investment strategies portfolio of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the equity portfolio is subject to equity price risk 
it is not hedged  consists of common stocks and is primarily managed to produce realized gains for gallagher 
the estimated potential loss in fair value of this equity component resulting from a hypothetical decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges of would be approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
gallagher s alternative investment strategies portfolio is also subject to equity pricing risk 
however  these investments are actively managed in order to minimize gallagher s exposure to equity pricing risk 
the objective of this portfolio is to maximize the overall return to gallagher  while minimizing the downward price risk in order to preserve the investments underlying principal balances 
the outside fund managers for these alternative investment strategies hedge their strategies by selling short common equity securities in order to mitigate the effects of changes in equity prices thereby making any such fluctuations immaterial 
accordingly  hypothetical changes in equity prices would not cause the resulting fair value to be materially different from the carrying value for this portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of gallagher s marketable securities available for sale portfolio was million million less than its aggregate amortized cost and million million less than its aggregate amortized costs at december  and  respectively 
the overall objective of this portfolio is to provide gallagher with a stable after tax yield 
this portfolio  which is not hedged  consists primarily of dividend yielding preferred stocks 
accordingly  this portfolio is more sensitive to interest rate risk than it is to equity pricing risk 
the estimated potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates would be approximately million at december  and at december  and  the fair value of gallagher s borrowings under the line of credit facilities approximated the carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in gallagher s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and  and the resulting fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily due to the fact that its united kingdom based subsidiaries incur expenses denominated in british pounds while receiving their revenues in united states dollars 
gallagher does not hedge this foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as they are incurred 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for and a weakening of the us dollar  earnings before income taxes would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively 
gallagher is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars 
however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to gallagher s consolidated operating results or financial position 
gallagher manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets thereby maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of gallagher are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the following gallagher s commission revenues are highly dependent on premiums charged by insurers  which are subject to fluctuation  the property casualty insurance industry continues to experience a prolonged soft market low premium rates thereby holding down commissions  lower interest rates will reduce gallagher s income earned on invested funds  the alternative insurance market continues to grow which could unfavorably impact commission but favorably impact fee revenue  gallagher s revenues vary significantly from period to period as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the net effect of new and lost business production  the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on gallagher s renewal business  gallagher s operating results and financial position may be adversely impacted by exposure to various market risks such as interest rate  equity pricing and foreign exchange rates  and gallagher s year compliance efforts depend upon compliance efforts of gallagher s business partners  vendors and clients 
gallagher s ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions  which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which  if consummated  may or may not be advantageous to gallagher 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements
