item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of operations  including trends that might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
overview we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that manufactures  markets and sells primarily branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
through a national sales force of approximately representatives and copromotion arrangements  we market our branded pharmaceutical products to general family practitioners  internal medicine physicians and hospitals across the country 
our business strategy is to acquire established branded pharmaceutical products and to increase their sales by focused marketing and promotion and through product life cycle management 
in pursuing acquisitions  we seek to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry created by cost containment initiatives and consolidation among large  global pharmaceutical companies 
we also create value by developing product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products such as new formulations  dosages or new indications 
these product line extensions are attractive to us because they may have market exclusivity or sales levels that do not attract significant competition 
in addition to branded pharmaceuticals  we also provide contract manufacturing for a number of the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including amgen  inc  warner lambert company  centocor  inc  mallinckrodt chemical  inc  genetics institute  inc 
and hoffman la roche inc our branded pharmaceutical products can be divided primarily into four therapeutic areas i cardiovascular including altace r  thalitone r and procanbid r  ii anti infectives including lorabid r  cortisporin r  neosporin r and coly mycin m r  iii vaccines and biologicals including fluogen r and aplisol r and iv women s health including menest r and pitocin r 
all of these products are marketed to general family practitioners and internal medicine physicians 
unlike many of our competitors  we have a broad therapeutic focus that provides us with opportunities to purchase a wide variety of products  as evidenced by our acquisition of products over the last months  including altace r and lorabid r 
in addition  we have well known products in all of our therapeutic categories that generate high prescription volumes 
our portfolio of well recognized prescription brand names includes  among others  altace r  lorabid r  neosporin r  cortisporin r  menest r  pitocin r  anusol hc r and fluogen r 
we acquired from glaxo wellcome the cortisporin r product line in march  the viroptic r product line in may and six additional branded products  including septra r  and exclusive licenses  free of royalty obligations  for the prescription formulations of neosporin r and polysporin r in november the glaxo acquisition 
in february we acquired from warner lambert branded pharmaceutical products  the parkedale facility located in rochester  michigan and certain manufacturing contracts for third parties for million  including million of assumed liabilities the sterile products acquisition 
in june we launched our new cortisporin r tc otic line 
cortisporin r tc otic is a product line extension for our cortisporin r otic suspension product 
in december we acquired from hoechst marion roussel  inc  predecessor to aventis hmr  for million the united states rights to altace r  an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor  hmr s worldwide rights to silvadene r and hmr s worldwide rights to avc tm  the altace acquisition 
aventis currently manufactures altace r for us 
we anticipate moving the manufacturing of altace r to the bristol facility prior to december  aventis will continue to supply raw materials for the process and we anticipate that aventis will continue to be the secondary manufacturer for this product 
in august  we acquired the antibiotic lorabid r from eli lilly and company for million including acquisition costs plus sales performance milestones that could bring the total value of the deal to million 
the final contingent payment will be made if we achieve million in annual net sales of lorabid r 
as part of the agreement  we acquired or licensed all of lilly s rights in the united states and puerto rico to lorabid r including lorabid r s new drug applications  investigational new drug applications  and certain patents and associated united states copyright and trademark material 
lilly manufactures lorabid r for us 
lorabid r has united states patent protection through december  in november  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire medco in an all stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
medco is a research and development company engaged in the development and global commercialization of cardiovascular medicines and adenosine based products 
on february   we completed the merger with medco by exchanging approximately million shares of king common stock for all of the outstanding shares of medco 
each share of medco was exchanged for of one share of king common stock 
in addition  outstanding medco stock options were converted at the same exchange ratio to purchase approximately  shares of king common stock 
our strategy is to continue to acquire branded pharmaceutical products and to create value by leveraging our marketing  manufacturing and product development capabilities 
the success of our marketing strategy will be aided by gaining approval of the new indications for altace r requested under the supplemental new drug application  which is now before the fda  and capitalizing on that approval by increasing our marketing efforts related to altace r  including the potential execution of copromotion agreements  and our ability to continue to develop product line extensions 
as soon as practicable after regulatory requirements are satisfied and when advantageous  we expect that manufacturing some of these acquired pharmaceutical products ourselves will increase our margins because the cost of producing pharmaceutical products on our own should be lower than the cost of having these products manufactured by third parties 
as discussed above  we anticipate beginning the manufacturing of altace r in our bristol facility prior to december  we manufacture pharmaceutical products for a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under contracts expiring at various times within the next four years 
we intend to enter into additional manufacturing contracts in cases where we identify contracts that offer significant volumes and attractive revenues 
we have not accepted or renewed manufacturing contracts for third parties where we perceived insignificant volumes or revenues 
in accordance with our focus on branded pharmaceutical products  we expect that  over time  our contract manufacturing will continue to be a smaller percentage of revenues 
the following summarizes approximate net revenues by operating segment in thousands 
for the years ended december  branded pharmaceuticals    contract manufacturing    other    total    results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  due primarily to the acquisition and growth of branded pharmaceutical products

net sales from branded pharmaceutical products increased million  or  to million in from million in the altace acquisition  the acquisition of lorabid r and revenue gains by fluogen r and the cortisporin r and neosporin r product lines accounted for most of the sales increase 
from time to time we announce price increases on some of our pharmaceutical products 
in advance of a price increase  many of our customers may order pharmaceutical products in larger than normal quantities 
we cannot determine the exact quantity of additional inventory that our customers may order in anticipation of a price increase 
the ordering of excess quantities in any quarter could cause sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products to be lower in the subsequent quarter than they would have been otherwise 
net revenues from fluogen r increased from million in to million in however  the amount of revenue  if any  that we can anticipate from fluogen r in the future is not certain at this time 
on march  we received written notice from the fda that we must cease and discontinue manufacturing  processing  packaging  labeling  and distributing all lots of fluogen r pending performance  and fda review and acceptance  of certain actions described in detail in a press release we issued on march  we are working with the fda and outside consultants to address the fda s concerns and complete the actions required by the fda related to fluogen r to gain fda approval for us to produce and distribute fluogen r in a timely manner in advance of and during the influenza virus vaccine season 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately address the fda s concerns or complete the actions required by the fda  or to gain the fda s approval of these actions in a timely manner without negatively impacting sales of fluogen r during the third and fourth quarters of revenues from contract manufacturing increased million  or  to million in from million in contract manufacturing revenues increased primarily because we had a full year of contract revenue from the sterile products acquisition that closed in february net sales from generic and other sources increased million  or  to million in from in the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased sales of a generic product line  offset by a decrease in development revenue

while cash flow from operations was reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million 
cash flows used in investing activities was million primarily due to the purchase of lorabid r for million  merger related costs of million and million of capital expenditures 
financing activities provided million of cash flow comprised principally of million in proceeds from senior subordinated notes and million in net proceeds from the revolving credit facility 
these amounts were offset by repayments of the million senior subordinated seller notes and million relating to the term loans 
year ended december  we generated net cash from operations of million for the year ended december  our net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of million in net income resulting from sales from recently purchased branded pharmaceutical products  adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  and an extraordinary loss on early retirement of existing indebtedness of million 
our net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by an increase in receivables and inventory of million and million  and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes of million  million  and million  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities was million due principally to the sterile products and the altace acquisitions  the menest r acquisition  and other purchases of property and equipment

certain indebtedness and other matters as of december   we have outstanding approximately million of long term debt including current portion  and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
of these amounts  approximately million were at variable rates based on libor and the remainder at fixed rates 
we have entered into million of interest rate hedging transactions with a group of commercial banks to exchange our variable libor for a fixed rate of interest 
we do not believe our exposure to changes in interest rates under the remaining variable rate agreements will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have also entered into a million interest rate hedging agreement to exchange our fixed interest rate for a variable libor based interest rate 
certain financing arrangements require us to maintain certain minimum net worth  debt to equity  cash flow and current ratio requirements 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
subsequent to the completion of the merger with medco  we utilized approximately million of cash and other investments from medco to repay million on our revolving credit facility and on term loans 
we believe that existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations are sufficient to finance our current operations and working capital requirements 
however  in the event we make significant future acquisitions or change our capital structure  we may be required to raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
at present  we are actively pursuing acquisitions that may require the use of substantial capital resources 
there are no present agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisitions 
we financed the acquisition of lorabid r with borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million and million for the years december  and  respectively 
the principal capital expenditures included property and equipment purchases and building improvements  including the sterile products acquisition in we expect to increase our capital expenditures over the next few years as a part of our acquisition and growth strategy 
year compliance we conducted an evaluation of our it and non it computer systems with respect to the year issue 
this issue arose because many electronic systems use two digits rather than four to determine dates 
this could have caused information technology systems such as software applications  hardware  network systems and embedded systems to misread important dates beginning in the year  which could cause system failures and disruption of operations 
we completed a year readiness assessment of our business critical it and non it systems 
as a result of the assessment  we developed and implemented corrective action plans designed to address year issues 
these plans included modification  upgrade and replacement of our critical administrative  production and research and development computer systems to make them year ready 
implementation of corrective action plans was completed before the end of the year  and we did not encounter any significant issues with respect to year because our operations depend on the uninterrupted flow of materials and services from our suppliers  we requested and received analyzing information from our suppliers with regard to year issues 
we monitored the progress of our key suppliers toward year readiness  and no significant issues were encountered 
we do not manufacture any products that were subject to year risks 
contingency plans were developed to avoid or mitigate the risks that either key suppliers or we might not achieve year readiness in time to avoid disruption of our operations 
we have not encountered any significant issues with respect to year risks 
the costs associated with the year computer problem as of december  have not been material 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while we have passed some price increases along to its customers  we have primarily benefited from rapid sales growth negating most inflationary pressures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk 
our financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
we have no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates rise and decrease as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility bears interest based on libor 
however  we have entered into an aggregate notional principal amount of million in interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   our swap agreements expire between and under these agreements  we pay a fixed weighted average interest rate of and receive a floating interest rate based on the one month libor 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to our fixed rate senior subordinated notes 
the notional amount at december  was million and the agreement expires in under this agreement we exchanged our fixed rate for a floating rate based on libor with the floating rate being fixed at through november  thereafter we pay a floating rate based on the three month libor 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represent the estimated payments or receipts that would be made to terminate the agreements 
at december   we would have received approximately million upon termination of the agreements 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes 
we have million of debt remaining that bears interest at a variable rate 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect interest expense
