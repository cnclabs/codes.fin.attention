item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s principal product is its clave needleless iv connection system 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by product as a percentage of total net sales product line clave click lock mcgaw protected needle lopez valve and other rf rf rhino custom iv systems b 
braun safeline revenue sharing total the company sells its products to independent distributors and through supply and distribution agreements with b 
braun  abbott the b 
braun agreement and the abbott agreement  respectively and c 
r 
bard  inc bard 
most independent distributors handle the full line of the company s products 
b 
braun and abbott both purchase clave products  principally bulk non sterile connectors 
b 
braun also purchases the mcgaw protected needle and pays the company revenue sharing payments on its sales of its safeline products 
abbott also purchases the rhino  a low priced connector specifically designed for abbott and the clc bard distributes the lopez valve under a five year agreement signed in june the b 
braun agreement  except for the safeline revenue sharing  extends to december  and has extension provisions beyond then 
in january  the company and abbott agreed to a significant expansion of their agreement for clave products 
the new agreement has assurances of substantial increases in sales unit volume  accompanied by price reductions 
the new agreement was extended from april to december  and designates the company as abbott s preferred supplier for all abbott s needlefree technology 
in july the contract was amended to include the clc management believes that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  the company s success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on the company s ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
further  the company s marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of the company s revenues being concentrated among a small number of customers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with a customer or the loss of a large contract by such a customer could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
management believes the success of the clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
the company is aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure  the company has been reducing prices to protect and expand its market 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume 
management expects that the average price of its clave products will continue to decline 
there is no assurance that the company s current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the company has commenced two initiatives that  if successful  will reduce its dependence on its current proprietary products 
it is seeking to substantially expand its custom iv systems business with products sold to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors 
it is also launching setfinder 
com  which will distribute commodity type standard iv sets directly to healthcare providers 
there is no assurance that either one of these initiatives will succeed 
effective january   the company reoriented its manufacturing and distribution operations 
marketing and sales operations will be in four groups medical product manufacturers under the icu medical name  independent domestic distributors under the budget medical products name  international manufacturers and distributors under the icu medical name and setfinder 
manufacturing will be in a separate group  producing products for the four marketing and sales groups 
bmp  until this reorientation  had been responsible for marketing and sales of only custom iv systems to both independent distributors and medical product manufacturers 
because bmp will now represent not a product line  but a distribution channel  the custom iv systems product line  formerly referred to as the bmp product line  will now be referred to as the custom iv systems product line 
net sales for each distribution channel  based on the new grouping  were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international total comparison of to in  the company had net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  including custom clave iv systems 
net sales to abbott were to  in  compared to  in clave unit sales were times the amount in most of the balance of the sales increase was in the low priced rhino  which increased to  from  in based upon the terms of the abbott agreement as amended through january  management expects a substantial increase in clave unit and dollar sales volume with abbott in  although there is no assurance as to the amount of such increase 
net sales to b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in clave net sales to b 
braun decreased approximately because of decreased average selling prices  unit shipments were up slightly 
management expects increases in clave unit shipments to b 
braun in  although there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle decreased  and management expects those sales to continue to decline in the future as the market for safe connectors continues its shift to needleless technology 
under an agreement with b 
braun  the company receives revenue sharing payments on b 
braun s sales of its safeline products  such payments commenced in  and the company recorded estimated revenue sharing of approximately  in  compared to  in the company expects that the agreement  which expires in june  will be extended  but there is no certainty as to this matter 
although management anticipates that such revenue sharing will continue  the actual amount will depend on the volume and selling prices of b 
braun s safeline products  which management has no means of forecasting accurately 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with abbott accounting for the entire unit growth 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to b 
braun and abbott  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
clave product sales  excluding custom clave iv systems  to independent domestic distributors decreased approximately  caused approximately equally by decreased average selling prices and decreased unit volume 
management expects a continued decrease in the net sales of standard clave products to the independent domestic distributors  but expects that decrease to be more than offset by sales of custom iv systems and new products such as the clc and the o valve 
there is no assurance that the company will achieve increased net sales to independent domestic distributors in the future 
further  the ability of the independent distributors to sustain their unit sales may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of clave market share by abbott and b 
braun 
management expects to encounter continued pricing pressure from individual end users  and expects continued declines in net prices to the independent distributors 
net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in compared to  because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology 
management expects that decline to continue 
the lopez valve showed a growth in net sales compared to principally because of shipments to bard under the contract signed in june management expects continued increases in lopez valve net sales in net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in most of the increase in net sales was because of increased unit shipments of custom iv sets incorporating the clave 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in compared to  in those amounts do not include distribution in canada 
since mid  the company has been arranging distribution in each country in europe to replace and expand upon that handled by a single distributor that was terminated in august the company now has distribution arrangements in most of the principal countries in europe  although there can be no assurance that those distribution arrangements will be satisfactory 
net sales to european customers increased in management expects that its sales to european and other foreign customers will continue to increase in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  the company launched setfinder doing business as setfinder 
com 
the effect of setfinder on results of operations was insignificant 
the company expects to spend a significant amount to continue to the launch and development of setfinder in there can be no assurance that setfinder will achieve sales and the amount of future operating profits or losses is dependent upon the future development of the setfinder business  the outcome of which s not known at this time 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency  particularly late in  and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
the company is currently taking steps aimed at improving manufacturing efficiency principally by reducing labor costs and minimizing investment in inventory 
the original focus was on production of custom iv systems  which is relatively labor intensive  it has now been expanded to include all the company s automated and manual manufacturing operations 
substantially all manual assembly is now performed at the facility that the company opened in december in ensenada  baja california  mexico 
in  the company made significant investment in automated molding and assembly equipment 
both these steps should reduce unit production costs in ongoing steps are aimed at increasing systems capabilities  improving manufacturing efficiency and enhancing distribution  as well as automation of the production of new products  such as the clc and the o valve  and other products for which volume is growing 
because significant innovation is required to achieve these goals  there is no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
however  even if they are successful  management expects that profit margins for custom iv systems  setfinder products and certain other manually assembled products will be lower than those historically recorded by the company because their production is relatively labor intensive 
the company expects that its unit production costs will continue to decrease in  but that the gross margin percentage will be equal to or slightly lower than that achieved in as average unit sales prices continue to decrease 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net sales in compared to in the increase in sg a costs was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the introduction of new products and expansion of the company s business  substantially offset by a significant decrease in litigation costs 
management expects sg a costs to increase in  because of growth in the company  increased domestic and international sales and marketing costs  promotional costs of new products and expansion of the custom iv system business and setfinder 
research and development r d costs increased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  compared to approximately  or of net sales  in management estimates that r d costs in will continue at approximately the same percentage of net sales as in however  r d costs could differ from those estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because sg a decreased as a percentage of net sales 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  down from in management expects its effective tax rate in to be equal to or slightly lower than the rate 
net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  principally because the increased average number of shares outstanding 
comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the most significant factor in the increase was a  or  increase in clave net sales 
net sales in all of the company s other product lines were equal to or more than those for  except for a decrease in click lock and piggy lock net sales 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with b 
braun and abbott accounting for the entire unit growth 
unit sales to independent distributors were down slightly 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to b 
braun and abbott  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales to abbott amounted to  in  compared to  in clave sales were times the amount in most of the balance of the sales were in the low priced rhino  which were  compared with  in net sales to b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in clave net sales to b 
braun increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle were virtually unchanged 
revenue sharing payments on b 
braun s sales of its safeline products was approximately  in  compared to  in net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in compared to  because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology 
the lopez valve showed a growth in net sales compared to principally because of increased unit shipments 
the company s net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in most of the increase in net sales was because of increased unit shipments of custom iv systems incorporating the clave 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in compared to  in gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products  continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation  and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net sales in compared to in the increase in sg a costs was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the company s domestic expansion of the clave product line  growth of bmp  expansion of the international sales efforts  and legal fees 
research and development r d costs decreased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  compared to approximately  or of sales  in the operating margin decreased to in  compared with in  principally because sg a increased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income increased from to  principally because of an increase in invested funds 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  approximately the same as in income from operations increased  as the increase in operating expenses of exceeded the increase in gross profit 
net income increased 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  principally because the increase in the price of the company s stock increased the dilutive effect of stock options 
liquidity and capital resources during  working capital decreased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities and  from exercise of stock options  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment  and  used to acquire treasury stock 
during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased to  from  due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities and  from exercise of stock options  partially  offset by  used to acquire treasury stock 
capital expenditures increased substantially in from the relatively low levels in through most of the expenditures were molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines in the company s san clemente  california production facilities 
in addition  in april  the company purchased a  square foot building near its other two buildings in san clemente to accommodate its expansion 
production capacity in san clemente significantly exceeds the company s current production requirements 
management expects that sales of the company s products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects the use of working capital to fund its operations to continue to increase 
in october  the company purchased  shares of its stock for treasury at a cost of  the company had not purchased treasury stock from august through september  it may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future acquisitions  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
the company believes that its existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
year compliance many older computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  they do not properly recognize a year that begins with rather than this is referred to as the year  or yk problem 
the yk problem has been eliminated in many new programs and systems  which are said to be yk compliant 
the company has not encountered any yk problems  and believes that it is extremely unlikely that it will 
costs to assure yk compliance were nominal
