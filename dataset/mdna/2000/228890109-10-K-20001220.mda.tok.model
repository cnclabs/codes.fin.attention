the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s products 
historically  gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s type a and type b bottling customers 
type a bottling customers pay the company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer 
type b bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges 
although gross profit per case for the company s type a and type b bottling customers is approximately equal  given the same case volume  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for type a bottling customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for type b bottling customers 
as a result  significant fluctuations in volume of type a bottling customers can distort the company s gross margin 
the company has a limited number of customers  and these customers often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  distilled spirits  vinegar and cooking wine 
accordingly  the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products during the months from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the company 
in addition  excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers 
accordingly  excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix

no such loss carryforwards or refunds were available in financial liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations  purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business and carrying inventories and the subsequent receivables 
the company s source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit 
some of the company s manufacturing operations are seasonal and the company s borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year 
for example  the company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two florida distilleries 
the company buys citrus molasses  a byproduct of citrus juice production  from local manufacturers of citrus juice and concentrate during the citrus harvest  which generally runs from november to june 
the company generally begins purchasing citrus molasses in november and builds inventory of citrus brandy and spirits 
the company must manufacture and build inventory while raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it purchases 
another seasonal business of the company is its contract bottling services 
demand for contract bottling services is highest during the months from april through october

million

the company s capital expenditures were million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to improving the company s wine production capacity  expanding vinegar production capacity and improving the company s rum production capacity 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which resulted from proceeds from term loans and other notes of million and an increase of million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility  offset by payments of long term debt totaling million 
in november  the company s previous long term debt and line of credit were replaced with a million credit agreement between the company and a syndicate of lenders 
the new credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility which expires in november and a term loan with an initial amount of million which matures on december  in november  the company used million of the term loan to fund the monarch acquisition 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million at september  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the company s long term debt 
the company s total debt was million as of september   and its ratio of debt to equity was to the company s share of the undistributed earnings of the bahamian and virgin islands subsidiaries was approximately million and million  respectively  as of september  no provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings as the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries 
based on current plans and business conditions  management expects that its cash and cash equivalents  together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

during the second quarter of fiscal effects of inflation and changing prices the company uses natural gas in its distilling operations and has recently experienced significant increases in its energy costs as a result of natural gas price increases 
at the present time  management believes that the company s energy costs relating to natural gas will continue to increase 
where competitively feasible  management plans to increase selling prices to offset the effects of natural gas price increases  but the company may not be able to recover these energy cost increases 
except as noted above  the company s results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices 
the company has been able  subject to normal competitive conditions  to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices
