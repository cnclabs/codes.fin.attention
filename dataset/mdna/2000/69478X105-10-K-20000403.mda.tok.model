rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million or per share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income was the result of three primary factors 
the sale of the parent company s residual mortgage backed securities related to three remaining securitizations resulted in a one time after tax charge of approximately million 
a lower of cost or market reserve was recorded in the amount of million against the company s held for sale loan portfolio 
additionally  the company provided an additional million for loan losses in the fourth quarter 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is due to an increase in average balance of interest earning assets  partially offset by a lower realized yield on the company s residual mortgage backed securities 
interest income on loans receivable increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of an million increase in average loans receivable 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase reflects million higher average interest bearing liabilities to support the growth in the company s assets 
the increase in retail deposits over wholesale deposits coupled with increased usage of the fhlb line of credit resulted in a decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  net interest income net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income is reflective of higher average assets combined with lower cost of funds from increased retail deposits  resulting in higher net interest margins for the period 
the bank s net interest margin for the year ending december  was compared to for the year earlier period 
provision for estimated loan losses the provision for loan losses increased from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase over the previous year reflects a change in the company s loan loss reserve policy primarily based on actual experience of charge offs and recoveries related to the company s high loan to value nd trust and sub prime st trust mortgage product

charge offs net of recoveries for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the year ended december  the company had non accrual loans at december  of million  compared to million at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the company s loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s or the bank s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loans portfolio 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance or to take charge offs reductions in the allowance in anticipation of losses

management of interest rate risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines through the establishment of prudent asset concentration guidelines 
through such management  management of the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management of the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the company s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
between the time the company originates loans and purchase commitments are issued  the company is exposed to both upward and downward movements in interest rates which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the board of directors of the company recently implemented a hedge management policy primarily for the purpose of hedging the risks associated with loans held for sale in the company s mortgage pipeline 
in a flat or rising interest rate environment  this policy enables management to utilize mandatory forward commitments to sell fixed rate assets as the primary hedging vehicles to shorten the maturity of such assets 
in a declining interest rate environment  the policy enables management to utilize put options 
the hedge management policy also permits management to extend the maturity of its liabilities through the use of short financial futures positions  purchase of put options  interest rate caps or collars  and entering into long interest rate swap agreements 
management may also utilize short interest rate swaps to shorten the maturity of long term liabilities when the net cost of funds raised by using such a strategy is attractive  relative to short term cd s or borrowings 
management is continuing to evaluate and refine its hedging policies 
no hedging positions were outstanding at december  net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purpose of the risk based capital requirement 
see item business regulation federal savings institution regulation 
as of december   the most recent date for which the relevant data is available  the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million reduction in the npv of the bank 
the ots has postponed indefinitely the date the component will first be deducted from an institution s total capital 
see item business federal savings institution regulation 
the following table shows the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp static  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb advances  other borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  cash proceeds from the sale of loans  and to a lesser extent  interest payments on investment securities and proceeds from the maturation of investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
however  the bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totalled million 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the utilization of fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had no advances outstanding from the fhlb 
other sources of liquidity include investment securities maturing within one year 
the bank also has a warehouse line of credit available in the amount of million of which zero had been drawn upon at december  the company has a million revolving line of credit of which million has been drawn upon at december  the ots capital regulations requires savings institutions to meet three minimum capital requirements a tangible capital ratio  a leverge core capital ratio  and an risk based capital ratio 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements and was therefore considered well capitalized 
see item regulation federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the company had no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures at december  at december  the company had million outstanding commitments to originate or purchase mortgage loans compared to million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current and anticipated loan origination commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totalled million 
the company expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained by the company at maturity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those derivatives at fair value 
the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of those derivatives will depend on the intended use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
on june   the fasb voted to approve a proposal to delay the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  calendar year for the company 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
