these increases were offset by a decrease in participating lease revenues at the san diego paradise point resort in due to decreased occupancy levels at the hotel resulting from the significant renovations taking place at the property during the year ended december  depreciation expense increased to million or for the year ended december   compared to depreciation expense for the pro forma year ended december   which would have been million 
this increase is attributable to the additional depreciation expense incurred on capital improvements  which were placed into service during real estate and personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the pro forma year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increased real estate taxes at the hotels

these costs would not have been incurred in the pro forma year ended december  advisory fees for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the pro forma year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a higher incentive fee for the pro forma year ended december   offset by an increase in the base fee for the year ended december  advisory fees for the year ended december  also include of expense for options granted to the advisor during at december   holiday inn plaza park was held for sale by the company

the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in march defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following is a reconciliation between net income and ffo for the year ended december  and for the period from april  inception through december  in thousands  except share data for the period from for the april  year ended inception december  through december  net income applicable to common shareholders

inflation the company s revenues come primarily from the participating leases  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the revenues at the hotels 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and their operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate 
the company s expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses primarily real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments 
year the year issue arose as the result of computer programs and systems having been designed and developed to use two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
as a result  these computer programs and systems had the potential to recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  pay invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
prior to december   the company  together with its hotel operators  had completed its efforts to minimize the risk of disruption related to year the company s year efforts involved the following stages i inventory and assessment of software  hardware and embedded systems  ii renovation  which involved converting  replacing or eliminating selected platforms  applications  databases and utilities  as well as the validation process of testing and verifying  and iii implementation  which involved returning the tested systems to operational status  initiating ongoing maintenance procedures to insure continued readiness and development of contingency plans for critical business systems should these systems have failed

 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  effective for fiscal years beginning after june   establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that the changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company borrows at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
in  the company obtained the amended credit facility  which provides for a maximum borrowing amount of up to million 
borrowings under the amended credit facility bear interest at variable market rates 
at december   the company s outstanding borrowings under the amended credit facility were million 
the weighted average interest rate under the facility for the year ended december  was at december   the company also had outstanding bonds payable of million  of which million represents the principal balance of the bonds and the remaining million represents unamortized premium 
the bonds bear interest at a fixed rate 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not the earnings or cash flows of the company 
changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt generally will not have a significant impact on the company  unless the company is required to refinance such debt 
at december   the carrying value of the bonds approximated their fair value 
on july   the company entered into a million mortgage loan the mortgage loan 
the loan is subject to a fixed interest rate of  matures in july   and requires interest and principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
at december   the carrying value of the mortgage loan was million  which approximated its fair value  as the interest rate associated with the borrowing approximates current market rates
