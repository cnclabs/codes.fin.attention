net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the million total in this increase in net interest income was attributable to a million  or  increase in interest income  offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense over the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million favorable volume variance  slightly offset by a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million favorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the increase in average interest earning assets resulted from strong growth in our average deposits  which increased million  or  from to the increase in average interest earning assets consisted of loans  which increased million  plus a combination of highly liquid  lower yielding federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities  which collectively increased million  accounting for of the total increase in average interest earning assets 
average loans increased million  or  in as compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
this growth was widely distributed throughout the loan portfolio  as reflected by increased average loan balances in most of our technology  life sciences and special industry niche practices  in specialized lending products  and throughout our loan offices located across the nation 
average investment securities for increased million  or  as compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits exceeded the growth in average loans during  and generated excess funds that were largely invested in us agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and commercial paper 
the growth in the investment portfolio reflected our actions to continue to increase  as well as further diversify our portfolio of short term investments in response to the continuing increase in liquidity 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in increased a combined million  or  over the prior year  resulting in an million favorable volume variance 
this increase was largely due to the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits during and our actions to continue to further diversify our portfolio of short term investments 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets combined to decrease interest income by million in  as compared to the prior year 
short term market interest rates have declined on an overall basis during the past year 
as a result of this decline  we earned lower yields during on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and our investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a million unfavorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
the average yield on loans in also decreased basis points from the respective prior year  accounting for the remaining million of the total unfavorable rate variance 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a basis points decline in our weighted average prime rate in as compared to the similar prior year period 
approximately of our loans were prime rate based at the end of the yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the comparable prior year period 
this decrease resulted from a slight decline in the average yield on loans  largely due to a decline in our average prime rate  as well as to a continuing shift in the composition of interest earning assets towards a higher percentage of highly liquid  lower yielding federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities 
this shift in the composition of average interest earning assets resulted from the aforementioned strong growth in deposits continuing to outpace the growth in loans

average investment securities for increased million  or  as compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits exceeded the growth in average loans during  and generated excess funds that were largely invested in us agency securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in increased a combined million  or  over the prior year  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
this increase was largely due to the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits during coupled with our actions to further diversify our portfolio of short term investments 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets in resulted in a decrease in interest income of million as compared to the prior year 
short term market interest rates declined during the second half of as a result of this decline  we earned lower yields in on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a million unfavorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
the average yield on loans in decreased basis points from  accounting for the remaining million of the total unfavorable rate variance 
this decrease was primarily attributable to both increased competition and a decline in the average prime rate we charged during the second half of  as a substantial portion of our loans are prime rate based 
the total yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the comparable prior year period 
this decrease resulted from a decline in the average yield on loans  largely due to both increased competition and a decline in our prime rate  as well as to a continuing shift in the composition of interest earning assets towards a higher percentage of highly liquid  lower yielding federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities 
this shift in the composition of average interest earning assets resulted from the aforementioned strong growth in deposits continuing to outpace the growth in our average loans during interest expense in decreased million from this decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of million  largely offset by an unfavorable volume variance of million 
the favorable rate variance largely resulted from a reduction in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product  from in to in the reduction during in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product was primarily attributable to a decline in short term market interest rates during the second half of and to our lowering the rates paid on bonus money market deposits by an additional basis points during the unfavorable volume variance of million resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities in as compared to this increase was largely concentrated in our bonus money market deposit product  which increased million  or  and was explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community during the past year  and by growth in the number of clients we serve 
the average cost of funds paid on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from to this decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product 
interest expense in increased million from this increase was due to an unfavorable volume variance of million  partially offset by a favorable rate variance of million 
the unfavorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities in as compared to this increase was largely concentrated in our bonus money market deposit product  which increased million  or  and was explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community during  and by growth in the number of clients we serve 
changes in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities had a million favorable impact on interest expense in as compared to this decrease in interest expense largely resulted from a reduction in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product from in to in the reduction during in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product was largely attributable to a decline in short term market interest rates during the second half of the average cost of funds paid in of was flat with the prior year 
although the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product decreased during as compared to  this was offset by a continuing shift in the composition of average interest bearing liabilities towards a higher percentage of deposits in that product 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans  and on our periodic assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for loan losses in was in response to an increasing trend in net charge offs 
we incurred net charge offs of million in and million in  compared to million in for a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses  see the item section entitled financial condition credit quality and the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income the following table summarizes the components of noninterest income for the past three years years ended december  dollars in thousands disposition of client warrants    letter of credit and foreign exchange income    client investment fees  deposit service charges    investment gains   other    total noninterest income    noninterest income increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was largely due to a million increase in income from the disposition of client warrants  coupled with a million increase in letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income and a million increase in client investment fees 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in investment gains 
noninterest income increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was largely due to a million increase in investment gains  a million increase in letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income and a million increase in income from the disposition of client warrants 
income from the disposition of client warrants totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we have historically obtained rights to acquire stock  in the form of warrants  in certain clients primarily as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques we employee to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming  and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond our control  including the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment 
we therefore cannot predict the timing and amount of income with any degree of accuracy and it is likely to very materially from period to period 
during the years ended december   and  a significant portion of the income from the disposition of client warrants was offset by expenses related to our efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities  and was also offset by increases to the provision for loan losses in those same years 
based on december  market valuations  we had potential pre tax warrant gains totaling million  of which million related to two clients 
we are restricted from exercising many of these warrants until the first three quarters of as of december   we held warrants in companies  many of which are non public companies  thus we are currently unable to value most of these warrants 
further  based on december  market valuations  we had a potential pre tax gain on a venture capital fund investment of million 
we are restricted from selling this publicly traded equity instrument until the first quarter of additionally  we are typically precluded from using any type of derivative instrument to secure the current unrealized gains associated with many of these equity instruments 
hence  the amount of income we realize from these equity instruments in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
further  we may reinvest some or all of the income realized from the disposition of these equity instruments in furthering our business strategies 
letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million total in  and an increase of million  or  from the million total in this growth reflects a concerted effort by our management to expand the penetration of trade finance related products and services among our growing client base  a large percentage of which provide products and services in international markets 
client investment fees totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
prior to june  we only earned client investment fees on off balance sheet funds that were invested by clients in investment securities such as us treasuries  us agencies and commercial paper 
off balance sheet client funds totaled billion at december  beginning in june  we began offering off balance sheet private label mutual fund products to clients 
we earn approximately basis points on the average balance in these products 
at december   billion in client funds were invested off balance sheet  including billion in the mutual fund products 
the significant growth in the amount of off balance sheet client funds was explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community during the past year  by growth in the number of clients we serve  and by increased marketing of off balance sheet private label mutual fund products 
income related to deposit service charges totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
clients compensate us for depository services either through earnings credits computed on their demand deposit balances  or via explicit payments recognized as deposit service charges income 
the increase in deposit service charges income in was due to both a reduction in earnings credits resulting from a decrease in short term market rates during and growth in our client base 
we realized million in gains on sales of investment securities during  compared to million in gains on sales of investment securities during  and a nominal gain on sales of investment securities during the gains primarily related to distributions received from venture capital fund investments 
the gains primarily related to sales of us treasury securities  us agency securities  mortgage backed securities  and collateralized mortgage obligations  with an aggregate book value of million 
all investment securities sold were classified as available for sale  and all sales were conducted as a normal component of our asset liability and liquidity management activities 
other noninterest income largely consisted of service based fee income  and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  respectively 
the increase in  as compared to and  was primarily due to a higher volume of cash management and loan documentation services related to our growing client base 
noninterest expense noninterest expense in totaled million  a million  or  increase from total noninterest expense was million in  up million  or  from we closely monitor our level of noninterest expense using a variety of financial ratios  including the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of noninterest expense  excluding costs associated with other real estate owned  by adjusted revenues  defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income  excluding income from the disposition of client warrants and gains or losses related to sales of investment securities 
this ratio reflects the level of operating expense required to generate of operating revenue 
our efficiency ratio was for  compared to and in and  respectively 
the following table presents the detail of noninterest expense and the incremental contribution of each expense line item to our efficiency ratio years ended december  percent of percent of percent of adjusted adjusted adjusted amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues dollars in thousands compensation and benefits    professional services    net occupancy expense    business development and travel    furniture and equipment    trust preferred securities distributions   postage and supplies    advertising and promotion    telephone    other    total  excluding cost of other real estate owned    cost of other real estate owned  total noninterest expense    compensation and benefits expenses totaled million in  a million  or  increase over the million incurred in this increase was largely the result of an increase in the number of average full time equivalent personnel fte we employ  combined with an increase in performance based compensation associated with our incentive bonuses and employee stock ownership plan 
average fte personnel increased from in to in compensation and benefits expenses in increased million  or  from the million total in the increase in compensation and benefits expenses in was primarily the result of an increase in the number of average fte personnel we employ  partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation due to lower than expected net income 
average fte personnel totaled in compared with in the increase in fte personnel from through was primarily due to a combination of our efforts to develop and support new markets through geographic expansion  to develop and expand products  services and niches  and to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities 
further growth in our fte personnel is likely to occur during future years as a result of the continued expansion of our business activities 
professional services expenses  which consist of costs associated with corporate legal services  litigation settlements  accounting and auditing services  consulting  and our board of directors  totaled million in  a million  or  increase from the million total in we incurred million in professional services expenses in the increase in professional services expense in  as compared to  primarily related to an increase in consulting fees associated with several business initiatives 
further  the increase in professional services expenses during the past three years reflects the extensive efforts we have undertaken to continue to build and support our infrastructure  as well as evaluate and pursue new business opportunities 
it also reflects our efforts in outsourcing several corporate functions  such as internal audit  facilities management and credit review  where we believe we can achieve a combination of cost savings and increased quality of service 
the increase in professional services in  as compared to  primarily related to an increase in both consulting fees associated with several business initiatives  including the year remediation project  and legal fees primarily related to loan consultations and the workout of various commercial credits 
occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses in  as compared to  was primarily the result of our continued geographic expansion to develop and support new markets 
the increase in occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses in  as compared to  was largely attributable to certain non recurring costs in connection with the expansion of our existing headquarters facility during the second quarter of and an increase in recurring expenses associated with that additional office space 
business development and travel expenses totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the million total in we incurred million in business development and travel expenses in the increase in business development and travel expenses during each of the last two years was largely attributable to overall growth in our business  including both an increase in the number of fte personnel and expansion into new geographic markets 
trust preferred securities distributions totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million for these distributions resulted from the issuance of million in cumulative trust preferred securities during the second quarter of the trust preferred securities pay a fixed rate quarterly distribution of and have a maximum maturity of years 
postage and supplies expenses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
total telephone expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in postage and supplies during each of the past two years was largely the result of overall growth in our business  including both an increase in the number of fte personnel and expansion into new geographic markets 
the decrease in telephone expense in  as compared to relates primarily to our efforts to negotiate lower telecommunications rates 
advertising and promotion expenses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in advertising and promotion expenses during each of the last two years reflects a concerted effort to increase our marketing nationwide 
other noninterest expenses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in other noninterest expenses in of million  as compared to  was primarily due to million in charitable contributions made to the silicon valley bank foundation and increased data processing costs 
the million increase in other noninterest expenses from to was largely due to an increase in data processing costs related to both growth in our business and several new business initiatives commenced in in and  we incurred minimal net costs associated with oreo 
additionally  during  we realized a net gain of million in connection with the sale of an oreo property that consisted of multiple undeveloped lots 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  compared to in and in the decrease in our effective income tax rate was principally attributable to an increase in the amount of tax exempt interest income we received  as well as to a change in our multi state income tax rate 
financial condition assets totaled billion at december   an increase of billion  or  compared to billion at december  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled a combined million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to the million outstanding at the prior year end 
this increase was attributable to our desire to maintain a high level of liquidity at year end in anticipation of the century date change 
investment securities the following table details the composition of investment securities  all of which were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  at december   and december  dollars in thousands us treasury us    us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds    mortgage backed securities    collateralized mortgage obligations    obligations of states and political subdivisions    commercial paper and other debt securities    money market mutual funds  bankers acceptances  warrant securities  venture capital fund investments    other private equity investments  federal reserve bank stock and tax credit funds    total    investment securities totaled billion at december   an increase of million  or  over the december  balance of billion 
this increase resulted from excess funds that were generated by strong growth in our deposits outpacing the growth in loans during  and primarily consisted of us agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and commercial paper 
the decrease in us treasury securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions was primarily due to maturities 
the overall growth in the investment portfolio reflected our actions to increase as well as to further diversify our investment portfolio in response to a continued significant increase in liquidity 
the increase in short term market interest rates during resulted in a pre tax unrealized loss on our available for sale fixed income securities investment portfolio of million as of december  this unrealized loss was offset by a pre tax unrealized gain of million associated with corporate equity securities  which includes our warrant securities  venture capital fund investments and other private equity investments 
because of the level of liquidity we maintain  we do not anticipate having to sell fixed income investment securities and incurring material losses on sales in future periods for liquidity purposes 
additionally  we are restricted from selling many of the corporate equity securities until the first three quarters of we are also typically precluded from using any type of derivative instrument to secure the current unrealized gains associated with many of these equity instruments 
hence  the amount of income we recognize in future periods from the disposition of these equity instruments may vary materially from the current unrealized amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
investment securities totaled billion at december   a million  or  increase over the december  balance of billion 
this increase resulted from excess funds that were generated by strong growth in our deposits outpacing the growth in loans during  and primarily consisted of us agency securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities 
the significant increase in municipal securities was composed of both taxable and non taxable municipal obligations  and was largely attributable to our obtaining slightly higher yields on these investments as compared to us agency discount notes and bonds and other short term securities 
the decreases in us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities and commercial paper was primarily due to sales and maturities 
the overall growth in the investment portfolio reflected our actions to increase as well as to further diversify our portfolio of short term investments in response to a continued significant increase in liquidity 
at december   there were no investment securities held by us which were issued by a single party  excluding securities issued by the us government or by us government agencies and corporations  and which exceeded of our stockholders equity at year end 
the following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on investment securities as of december  the weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available for sale securities  which are reported at fair value 
expected remaining maturities of certain us agency securities  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations will generally differ from their contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties

this risk  known as prepayment risk  may cause the mbs  the cmo and the agencies to remain outstanding for a period of time different than that assumed at the time of purchase 
when interest rates decline  prepayments generally tend to increase  causing the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs  the cmo and the agencies to decline 
conversely  if interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease  lengthening the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs  the cmo and the agencies 
loans the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  for each of the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands commercial      real estate construction      real estate term      consumer and other      total loans      while we continue to generate new loans in most of our technology and life sciences and special industry niche practices  as well as in specialized lending products  many of our clients  primarily in the technology and life sciences niche  have received significant cash inflows from the capital markets and venture capital community 
consequently  we have experienced higher than normal paydowns and loan payoffs  which has caused total loans to remain relatively unchanged from the end of to december  the following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of our loans reported on a gross basis at december  for fixed and variable rate loans december  after one year one year and through after five or less five years years total dollars in thousands fixed rate loans commercial     real estate construction   real estate term     consumer and other   total fixed rate loans     variable rate loans commercial     real estate construction     real estate term     consumer and other     total variable rate loans     upon maturity  loans satisfying our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal 
such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans 
we do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms 
a substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature  and such loans are generally made to emerging growth and middle market companies in a variety of industries 
as of december   no single industry sector as identified by standard industrial codes represented more than of our loan portfolio 
loan administration authority over our loan policies resides with our board of directors 
this authority is managed through the approval and periodic review of our loan policies 
the board of directors delegates authority to the directors loan committee to supervise our loan underwriting  approval and monitoring activities 
the directors loan committee consists of outside board of directors members and our chief executive officer  who serves as an alternate 
subject to the oversight of the directors loan committee  lending authority is delegated to the chief credit officer and our internal loan committee which consists of the chief credit officer  the chief executive officer of silicon valley bank and other senior members of our lending management 
requests for new and existing credits which meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our internal loan committee by designated senior lenders or jointly with a senior credit officer 
credit quality and the allowance for loan losses credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
while we follow underwriting and credit monitoring procedures which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  our potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated financial position and earnings 
lending money involves an inherent risk of nonpayment 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  our management seeks to reduce such risks 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate to provide a financial buffer for losses  both identified and unidentified  in the loan portfolio 
we regularly review and monitor the loan portfolio to determine the risk profile of each credit  and to identify credits whose risk profiles have changed 
this review includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
we identify potential problem credits and  based upon known information  we develop action plans 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration  and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component  composed of allocated and unallocated portions that supplement the first two components  includes our management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of our management 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance at january       charge offs commercial      real estate consumer and other total charge offs      recoveries commercial      real estate  consumer and other total recoveries      net charge offs recoveries     provision for loan losses      balance at december       net charge offs recoveries to average total loans the following table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans december  percent percent percent of total of total of total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount dollars in thousands commercial     real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated  n a  n a  n a  total     december  percent percent of total of total loans amount loans dollars in thousands commercial  real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated n a  n a total  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to million at december  this increase was due to million in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses  offset by net charge offs of million during the net charge off amount was composed of million in gross charge offs and million in gross recoveries 
the gross charge offs included a million commercial credit in our financial services non technology niche and a million commercial credit in our computers and peripherals niche 
of the total gross charge offs  million were classified as nonperforming loans at the end of the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses as of december  increased million  or  from the prior year end 
this increase reflects our decision to further bolster the allowance for loan losses and maintain strong coverage ratios based on the economic uncertainty surrounding many of our markets in and the higher than normal gross charge offs experienced throughout the gross charge off total included million and million in charge offs that were incurred during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
gross charge offs for the third quarter of  the largest of which was million  were primarily related to five commercial credits and were not concentrated in any particular niche or industry 
of the total third quarter gross charge offs  million were classified as nonperforming loans at the end of we incurred million in gross charge offs during the fourth quarter of  primarily centered in our quickstart and bridge portfolios 
gross charge offs in the fourth quarter of included three bridge loans and four quickstart loans totaling million and million  respectively 
our quickstart product was based in large part on an analysis that indicates that almost all venture capital backed clients that receive a first round of equity infusion from a venture capitalist will receive a second round 
the analysis indicated that the second round typically occurred months after the first round 
hence  proceeds from the second round could be used to pay off the month term loan offered under the quickstart product 
however  the second round has been occurring much sooner than expected and the additional cash infusion has occasionally been depleted before months 
the likelihood of a third round occurring is not as great as a second round and thus this resulted in higher than anticipated charge offs related to this product during the fourth quarter of gross charge offs for were million  and included charge offs totaling million related to two commercial credits  one in our technology and life sciences niche and the other in one of our special industry niches 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to a commercial credit in one of our special industry niches that was partially charged off in gross charge offs for were million  and primarily resulted from five credits  none of which were related to the bank s technology and life sciences niche 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to one commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan recoveries in of million included million in recoveries from a real estate client relationship that had been charged off in and million in recoveries related to a commercial credit that was partially charged off in pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with our primary regulators  silicon valley bank has committed to further enhance its credit monitoring and review policies and submit reports to the regulators regarding credit quality 
we have continued to evaluate both us and international economic events during and the forecasts for the us economy for  in an effort to monitor the markets we serve 
the outlook for the us economy in is uncertain and although no significant current or forecasted negative impact has been identified with respect to our loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations  we have decided to bolster the allowance for loan losses 
future events and circumstances surrounding the economic conditions in the us and elsewhere cannot be predicted  nor can the impact of these future events and circumstances on our loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations be determined at the present time 
we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause us to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as deemed necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
nonperforming assets consist of loans that are past due days or more which are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and oreo and other foreclosed assets 
the table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses

there were no real estate construction or real estate term loans on nonaccrual status at december  and december  commercial   consumer and other total nonaccrual loans   nonperforming loans totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million total at december  of the total nonperforming loans at year end  million were charged off  million were placed on performing status and million were repaid during additionally  million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during and still classified as nonperforming loans at the end of nonperforming loans at the end of the fourth quarter included one commercial credit totaling million in our financial services non technology niche  which has been partially charged off  as described above 
this credit has been classified as nonperforming since march  our management believes this credit is adequately secured with collateral and reserves  and that any future charge offs associated with this loan will not have a material impact on our future net income 
nonperforming loans totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million total at december  of the total nonperforming loans at year end  million were charged off  million were placed on performing status and million were repaid during an additional million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during and still classified as nonperforming at december  nonperforming loans at december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from the million total at december   as a million net increase in nonaccrual loans during was largely offset by the payoff during the first quarter of of one credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the increase in nonaccrual loans at december   from the prior year end  was primarily due to two commercial credits totaling approximately million which were placed on nonaccrual status during the last half of  one of which was returned to performing status in the first quarter of and the other was partially charged off in  with the remaining balance still in nonperforming 
nonperforming loans at december  included the aforementioned credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the export import bank of the us ex im provided us with a guarantee of this credit facility  and we received the guarantee payment related to this credit from the ex im in the first quarter of in addition to the loans disclosed in the foregoing analysis  we have identified four loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately million  that  on the basis of information known to us  were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
we are not aware of any other loans where known information about possible problems of the borrower casts serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
we held no oreo or other foreclosed assets at december  oreo or other foreclosed assets totaled a combined million at december  the oreo and other foreclosed assets balance at december  consisted of one oreo property and one other asset which was acquired through foreclosure  both of which were sold during the oreo property consisted of multiple undeveloped lots and was acquired by us prior to june the one other asset acquired through foreclosure  which totaled million at december   consisted of a favorable leasehold right under a master lease which we acquired upon foreclosure of a loan during deposits our deposits are largely obtained from clients within our technology and life sciences niche  and  to a lesser extent  from businesses within our special industry niches and from individuals served by our executive banking division 
we do not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and do not accept brokered deposits

a significant portion of the increase in deposits during was concentrated in our noninterest bearing demand deposits  which increased billion  or  from the prior year end 
this increase was explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community and the equity markets  and by growth in the number of clients served by us during client deposits in our bonus money market product totaled billion at december   a million  or  decrease from the billion prior year end balance 
despite the high levels of client liquidity  our money market deposits at december  decreased million from the prior year end 
the decrease in money market deposits was the result of our lowering bonus money market deposit rates basis points during and marketing higher yielding off balance sheet private label mutual fund products to clients 
we took this action in order to lower total assets and thereby increase our tier leverage capital ratio 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters 
the aggregate amount of time deposit accounts individually exceeding  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   all time deposit accounts exceeding  were scheduled to mature within one year 
no material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business 
interest rate risk management a key objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash flows and market interest rate movements 
interest rate risk occurs when interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously and in equal volumes 
our asset liability committee alco provides oversight to our interest rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by our board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis  and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate and agreed to by our alco 
we manage interest rate risk principally through strategies involving our investment securities portfolio  including adjusting both the maturity structure of the portfolio and the amount of interest rate sensitive securities 
our policies also permit the limited use of off balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk 
at december   we held one such off balance sheet derivative security in the form of an interest rate swap for a notional principal amount of million scheduled to mature on march  this transaction was entered into as part of our normal interest rate risk management process 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements financial instruments with off balance sheet risk for additional related discussion 
our monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model which provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice within a specific time period and the amount of funding sources anticipated to reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of funding sources repricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
our policy guidelines provide that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets should not exceed 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that we were positioned within these guidelines as the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was 
the following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  assets and liabilities which mature or reprice after after after immedi day to month to months to months to ately month months months year dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities us treasury and agencies obligations    collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities     obligations of states and political subdivisions    commercial paper and other debt securities  other equity securities  total investment securities     loans       total interest earning assets      funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits     total interest bearing deposits     trust preferred securities portion of noninterest bearing funding sources total funding sources     off balance sheet items interest rate swap   gap      cumulative gap      assets and liabilities which mature or reprice after year to years after years not stated total dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities us treasury and agencies obligations   collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities    obligations of states and political subdivisions    commercial paper and other debt securities  other equity securities   total investment securities     loans     total interest earning assets     funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits  total interest bearing deposits  trust preferred securities   portion of noninterest bearing funding sources   total funding sources    off balance sheet items interest rate swap gap    cumulative gap   includes interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions of as of december  principal cash flows are based on estimated principal payments as of december  not stated column consists of investments in equity securities  tax credit funds  venture capital funds  and federal reserve bank stock as of december not stated column consists of nonaccrual loans of  and overdrafts of  offset by unearned income of  as of december  maturity repricing columns for fixed rate loans are based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of december  one application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as our market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
this analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest rate sensitive financial instruments  which would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  and the resulting effect on our mvpe 
policy guidelines establish maximum variances in our mvpe of and in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
at december   our mvpe exposure related to the aforementioned changes in market interest rates was within policy guidelines 
the following table presents our mvpe exposure at december  and december  related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
estimated increase decrease in mvpe change in interest estimated rates basis points mvpe amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates  our mvpe would be expected to decrease slightly or remain unchanged 
the market value calculations supporting the results in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows utilizing both market interest rates provided by independent broker dealers and other publicly available sources which we deem reliable 
these calculations do not contemplate any changes that our alco could make to reduce our mvpe exposure in response to a change in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of our asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding table 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different mvpe estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting mvpe estimates are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  the underlying value 
the simulation model also provides the alco with the ability to simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast simple simulation 
in order to measure  as of december   the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates  utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to a base market interest rate forecast derived from the treasury yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
our policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income sensitivity exceeding 
simulations as of december  indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting us 
other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk 
the impact on us  resulting from these latter two market risks  is deemed immaterial and no separate quantitative information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein 
we do not maintain a portfolio of trading securities and do not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
liquidity another important objective of asset liability management is to manage liquidity 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand and depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they come due  without causing an undue amount of cost or risk  and without causing a disruption to normal operating conditions 
we regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns  present and forecasted market and economic conditions  individual client funding needs  and existing and planned business activities 
our alco provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines  subject to board of directors approval  and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs 
the ability to attract a stable  low cost base of deposits is our primary source of liquidity 
other sources of liquidity available to us include short term borrowings  which consist of federal funds purchased  security repurchase agreements and other short term borrowing arrangements 
our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets 
our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations  federal funds sold  securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities maturing within six months  investment securities eligible and available for pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months  and anticipated near term cash flows from investments 
our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits should not fall below 
at december   our ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 
this ratio is well in excess of our minimum policy guideline and is higher than the comparable ratio of as of december  in addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits  we also utilize other policy measures in our liquidity management activities 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all of these policy measures 
in analyzing our liquidity during  reference is made to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
the statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities included net income of million for  which was adjusted for certain non cash items including the provision for loan losses  depreciation  deferred income taxes  and an assortment of other miscellaneous items 
investing activities consisted primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of investment securities  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million  and the net change in total loans resulting from loan originations and principal collections  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million in financing activities reflected the net change in our total deposits  which increased million during  and net cash proceeds received during the year from the issuance of common stock totaling million 
in total  the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash inflow of million for and total cash and cash equivalents  as defined in our consolidated statement of cash flows  of billion at december capital resources our management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that silicon and silicon valley bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
our primary sources of new capital include the issuance of trust preferred securities and common stock  as well as retained earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we issued million shares of common stock at per share 
we received proceeds of million related to the sale of these securities  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
in addition  in we issued million in cumulative trust preferred securities through a newly formed special purpose trust  svb capital i 
the securities had an offering price liquidation amount of per security and distributions at a fixed rate of are paid quarterly 
the securities have a maximum maturity of years and qualify as tier capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve board 
we received proceeds of million related to the sale of these securities  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
the trust preferred securities are presented as a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption company obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures 
for additional related discussion  see item financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements trust preferred securities 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was primarily due to net income of million  net proceeds from the common stock issuance of million and an increase in after tax net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of million 
we have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since  and we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the table below presents the relationship between the following significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth both silicon and silicon valley bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these capital guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio requirements are and  respectively  of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
the federal reserve board has also established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
both silicon s and silicon valley bank s capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december    and capital ratios for silicon and silicon valley bank are set forth below december  silicon valley bancshares total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio silicon valley bank total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the increase in the total risk based capital ratio and the tier risk based capital ratio at the end of from the prior year end was primarily attributable to an increase in tier capital 
this increase was due to both the issuance of common stock during  which generated net proceeds of million  and internally generated capital  primarily net income of million 
the tier leverage ratio also improved as of december  when compared to december   although not as significantly as the risk based capital ratios  due to an increase in quarterly average total assets partially offsetting the increase in tier capital 
quarterly average total assets increased due to the strong growth in deposits during in an informal arrangement with silicon valley bank s primary banking regulators  pursuant to a memorandum of understanding entered into in late september  silicon valley bank has agreed to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least 
as of december   we were in compliance with this term of the memorandum of understanding silicon s total risk based capital ratio at the end of was unchanged from the prior year end and tier risk based capital ratio was slightly higher than the prior year end  as growth in tier capital was offset by an increase in total assets 
this increase in total assets was largely in lower risk weighted categories and resulted from our strong deposit growth exceeding our loan growth during our tier leverage ratio increased to from at december  this increase was partially achieved through the issuance of million in cumulative trust preferred securities during through svb capital i 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
if a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans  our business  profitability and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as a lender  the largest risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due 
if borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses  it could have an adverse affect on our business  profitability and financial condition 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses is dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment 
we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business  profitability or financial condition 
because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio  our levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs can be volatile  and we may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period  which could cause reduced net income or net losses in that period 
our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies 
many of our loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative cash flow and no established record of profitable operations 
in some cases  repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others 
collateral for many of the loans often includes intellectual property  which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of a default 
because of the intense competition and rapid technological change which characterizes the companies in our technology and life sciences niche  a borrower s financial position can deteriorate rapidly 
we also make loans which are larger relative to the revenues of the borrower than those made by traditional small business lenders  so the impact of any single borrower default may be more significant to us 
because of these characteristics  our level of nonperforming loans and loan charge offs can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period 
for example  our nonperforming loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december  million  or of total loans  at september  million  or of total loans  at june  million  or of total loans  at march  million  or of total loans  at december  changes in our level of nonperforming loans may require us to make material provisions for loan losses in any period  which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period 
for example  our provision for loan losses was million for the three months ended december  and million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the comparable periods 
if the amount of capital available to start up and emerging growth companies decreases  it could adversely affect our business  profitability and growth prospects 
our strategy has focused on providing banking products and services to start up and emerging growth companies receiving financial support from sophisticated investors  including venture capital  angel and corporate investors 
in some cases  our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel backed client will receive a second or third round of equity infusion from investors 
if the amount of capital available to start up and emerging growth companies decreases  it is likely that the number of our new clients and the financial support investors provide to our existing borrowers would decrease which could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability and growth prospects 
among the factors that could affect the amount of capital available to start up and emerging growth companies is the receptivity of the capital markets to initial public offerings or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our technology and life sciences niche  the availability and return on alternative investments and general economic conditions in the technology and life sciences industries 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
we are currently party to a memorandum of understanding with our primary banking regulators which requires us to increase capital and restricts our ability to declare dividends and take other actions without regulatory consent 
silicon and silicon valley bank are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of stockholders or security holders 
federal laws and regulations limit the activities in which silicon may engage as a bank holding company 
in addition  both silicon and silicon valley bank are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital 
federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory action as they deem appropriate with respect to silicon valley bank and silicon 
supervisory actions such as the memorandum of understanding described in the next paragraph can result in higher capital requirements  higher insurance premiums and limitations on the activities of silicon or silicon valley bank which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
silicon valley bank is currently addressing issues raised by the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the california department of financial institutions 
in an informal arrangement with these regulators pursuant to a memorandum of understanding entered into in september  silicon valley bank has agreed to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least 
silicon valley bank s tier leverage ratio was at december  silicon valley bank has also committed to further enhance its credit review and monitoring procedures and submit regular reports to the regulators regarding credit quality 
we will continue to pursue various strategies to comply with the memorandum of understanding  including emphasizing off balance sheet private label mutual fund products to slow growth in deposits and restraining growth in our average assets 
however  if we fail to comply with our understanding with the regulators  we could be subject to additional regulatory action which could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
as part of the memorandum of understanding  silicon valley bank has agreed to seek regulatory approval before making dividend payments to silicon 
silicon has also been directed to seek regulatory approval before declaring cash dividends or dividends in kind  or repurchasing outstanding stock 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock since and do not anticipate paying dividends on  or repurchasing  our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we received regulatory approval to make the march  quarterly distribution on our cumulative trust preferred securities from cash which was available at silicon 
if we do not receive approval to make future distributions on these securities  we will be required to defer payment in accordance with the terms of these securities 
while the terms of the cumulative trust preferred securities allow us to defer distributions for up to consecutive quarters without triggering any event of default  we cannot predict what effect any deferral would have on our future ability to raise funds in the fixed income securities markets 
silicon will also need regulatory approval before incurring debt  which could reduce our financial flexibility  and before entering into agreements to acquire entities or portfolios 
this latter restriction could reduce our operational flexibility in the few cases where we are not already legally required to seek prior regulatory approval for acquisitions 
our currently existing unrealized warrant and venture capital fund portfolio gains may never be realized 
we have historically obtained rights to acquire stock  in the form of warrants  in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
we also have made investments in venture capital funds from time to time 
we may not be able to realize gains from these equity instruments in future periods  or our realized gains may be materially less than the current level of unrealized gains disclosed in this filing  due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
the timing and amount of income  if any  from the disposition of client warrants and venture capital fund investments typically depend upon factors beyond our control  including the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
therefore  we cannot predict future gains with any degree of accuracy and any gains are likely to vary materially from period to period 
in addition  a significant portion of the income we realize from the disposition of client warrants and venture capital fund investments may be offset by expenses related to our efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support our present and future business activities  as well as by expenses incurred in evaluating and pursuing new business opportunities  or by increases to our provision for loan losses 
public offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to be paid off early  which could adversely affect our business and profitability 
we experienced only modest loan growth in  primarily as a result of this phenomenon 
while an active market for public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive implications for our business  one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering or are acquired or merge with another company 
any significant reduction in our outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
our total loans  net of unearned income  at december   were billion  relatively unchanged from the prior year end 
while we continue to generate new loans in most of our technology and life sciences and special industry niche practices  as well as in specialized lending products  many of our clients  primarily in the technology and life sciences niche practice  have received significant cash inflows from the capital markets and venture capital community 
consequently  we have experienced higher than normal loan paydowns and payoffs  which has caused our total loans to remain relatively unchanged during our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future 
any material reduction in our interest spread could have a material impact on our business and profitability 
a major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets  such as loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  global economic disruptions  and unemployment 
in late  we reduced the interest rates which we pay on deposits  despite a generally increasing trend in domestic interest rates  and our rates are now lower than those of some of our competitors 
we reduced our rates as part of our balance sheet management efforts 
in the future  we may be required to increase our deposit rates to attract deposits
