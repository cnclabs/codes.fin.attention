the company has given its internal underwriting department complete authority for all initial underwriting decisions 
the company s mpl agents have no binding authority 
as part of the mpl underwriting process  the company utilizes the data collected by the states of florida and missouri  which includes a record of all mpl claims paid information that insurers are required to report 
when applications are received from physicians for mpl insurance  the company reviews this database to verify the physician s claims paid record 
if a physician has an excessive claims paid history  the application is denied 
all other applicants are reviewed on the basis of the physician s educational background  residency experience  practice history and comments received from personal references 
annually  the company s underwriting department also reexamines each insured before coverage is renewed  including verifying that the insured s license is current and that any reported claims for the insured were within acceptable limits 
in underwriting lpl insurance  the company s underwriters use an underwriting committee composed of lawyers 
the committee is geographically broad based  and in most instances  has personal knowledge of applicants and renewals

the company believes that it has developed relationships with attorneys in florida and missouri who have significant experience in the defense of mpl lpl claims and who are able to defend in an aggressive  cost efficient manner the claims against the company s insureds 
reinsurance the company follows the customary industry practice of reinsuring its business 
the company cedes to reinsurers a portion of its risks and pays a fee based upon premiums received on all policies subject to such reinsurance 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to provide protection against large losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies reinsured  it does make the reinsurer liable to the company to the extent of risk ceded 
for mpl  lpl  and professional and comprehensive general liability insurance written during and prior years  the company has reinsured risks in excess of  per loss  except on the company s anesthesiology program in which the company has reinsured risks in excess of  the company reinsures risks associated with these policies under treaties pursuant to which reinsurers agree to assume those risks insured by the company in excess of its individual risk retention level and up to its maximum individual policy limit offered 
effective january   the company lowered its retention to  and thus  reinsures risks in excess of  per loss on business written in for group accident and health insurance  the company has entered into a separate excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
under this treaty  the reinsurers bear losses in excess of  per person 
for workers compensation insurance  the company has entered into a separate excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
under this treaty  the reinsurers bear losses in excess of  per loss 
reinsurance is placed under reinsurance treaties and agreements with a number of individual companies and syndicates to mitigate concentration of credit risk 
general reinsurance corporation has been one of the company s largest reinsurers of mpl insurance  with of the ceded risks for professional and comprehensive general liability insurance written in and prior years 
the company relies on reinsurance brokers and intermediaries to assist in the analysis of the credit quality of its reinsurers 
the company also requires reinsurers that are not authorized to do business in florida and missouri to post an evergreen letter of credit to secure their reinsurance recoverables 
under florida and missouri laws  in the event the company has the opportunity to settle a claim within policy limits but fails to do so  and a judgment is rendered against a policyholder for an amount exceeding the policy limit  the company may be charged with bad faith in failing to settle 
the company may be held responsible for the amount exceeding the policy limit or extra contractual damages 
the company s primary reinsurance contracts include coverage for policies with limits equal to or greater than million for which the claim exceeds policy limits or extra contractual damage 
in the past five years  the company has not paid a claim  including bad faith claims  in excess of million 
effective january   the company has obtained reinsurance covering such claims 
liability for loss and lae the determination of the total liability for loss and lae is based upon a projection of ultimate losses through an actuarial analysis of the claims history of the company and other mpl insurers  subject to adjustments deemed appropriate by the company due to differing or changing circumstances 
included in its claims history are losses and lae paid by the company in prior periods and case reserves for anticipated losses and lae developed by the company s claims department as claims are reported and investigated 
the company relies primarily on such historical loss experience in determining reserve levels on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience despite the uncertainties in loss cost trends and the delays in reporting and settling claims 
as additional information becomes available  the estimates reflected in earlier loss and lae reserves may be revised 
any increase in the amount of reserves  including reserves for insured events of prior years  could have an adverse effect on the company s results for the period in which the adjustments are made 
the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate losses on the basis of past experience have grown significantly in recent years principally as a result of judicial expansion of liability standards and expansive interpretations of insurance contracts 
these uncertainties may be further affected by  among other factors  changes in the rate of inflation and changes in the propensities of individuals to file claims 
mpl insurance is a long tail line of business for which the initial loss and lae estimates may be adversely impacted by events occurring long after the reporting of the claim  such as sudden severe inflation or adverse judicial or legislative decisions 
the company utilizes both its staff and independent actuaries in establishing its reserves 
the company s independent actuaries review the company s loss and lae reserves one or more times each year and prepare a report that includes a recommended level of reserves 
the company considers this recommendation as well as other factors  such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of losses  loss retention levels and premium rates  in establishing the amount of its loss and lae reserves 
the company continually refines reserve estimates as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
the company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of the current period 
the following table sets forth the development of loss and lae reserves of the company  net of reinsurance recovered or recoverable  for the year period ended december  year ended december balance sheet reserves        reestimated liability as of one year later       two years later      three years later     four years later    five years later   six years later  seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative paid as of one year later       two years later      three years later     four years later    five years later   six years later  seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later redundancy       redundancy balance sheet reserves     reestimated liability as of one year later     two years later     three years later     four years later     five years later     six years later     seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  cumulative paid as of one year later     two years later     three years later     four years later     five years later     six years later     seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  redundancy     redundancy there may be a difference of  in the redundancies due to rounding 
the company has changed its presentation of the above data from a gross basis to a net of reinsurance basis  which is consistent with prevalent practice 
data presented for the years through have been restated accordingly 
data presented for the years prior to have previously been reported on a net basis and  therefore  no restatement is necessary for these years 
the following table in thousands sets forth an analysis of the company s reserves for losses and lae and provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability for loss and lae  net of reinsurance for the periods presented year ended december  net loss and lae liability  at beginning of period    loss and lae of entity acquired   provisions for losses and lae occurring in the current period    decrease in estimated losses and lae for claims occurring in prior periods    total incurred during current period    losses and lae payments relating to current period    prior periods    total paid during current period    net liability  at end of period    gross liability at end of period    reinsurance recoverable at end of period    net liability at end of period    the net reductions in incurred losses and lae related to prior years net of reinsurance recoveries of   and  in   and  respectively for each of the years ended december   and  are the result of reevaluations of the adequacy of reserve estimates and reflect overall favorable underwriting results and lower than anticipated losses and lae 
given recent competitive market conditions  which have lessened the company s ability to underwrite and price its business at such favorable terms  management does not expect reserve reductions to continue at these levels in furthermore  given the inherent uncertainties in the estimation of loss and lae reserves  there can be no assurance concerning future adjustments  positive or negative  for prior years claims 
investment portfolio the company s investment strategy for its bond portfolio is to maintain a diversified investment grade fixed income portfolio  provide liquidity  and maximize after tax yield 
as of december   the company s portfolio was managed internally and the company had million of fixed income securities valued at market value 
all of the company s fixed income and equity securities are classified as available for sale 
the company believes that its focus on income generation rather than capital appreciation has reduced the portfolio s overall volatility 
in addition  the company has invested a greater portion of its portfolio in municipal bonds  which the company believes generate a greater after tax return than investments in taxable fixed income securities of comparable risk  duration  and other investment characteristics 
all of the fixed maturity securities held in the investment portfolio are publicly traded securities 
in addition to the fixed income portfolio  the company invests in other securities such as investment partnerships and certain strategic equity investments 
aside from certain strategic investments  the company s current policy is to limit such investments to million in aggregate 
the company generally does not invest in off balance sheet derivative financial investments 
however  the company has invested in one interest rate swap contract in connection with its revolving credit facility 
the contract is an off balance sheet instrument and serves to fix the company s interest expense on the revolving credit facility 
competition the mpl insurance markets in florida and missouri are highly competitive from the perspective of pricing and the number of competitors writing business 
several companies offer products at lower premium rates than the company and more companies may enter the company s markets in the future 
in addition  the company believes that the number of healthcare entities that insure their affiliated physicians through self insurance may begin to increase and affect both its florida and missouri based operations 
many of the mpl insurers are substantially larger and have considerably greater resources than the company 
additionally  several of these insurers have received am best ratings that are higher than the company s insurance subsidiaries ratings of a excellent 
in addition  because a substantial portion of the company s products are marketed through independent insurance agencies  all of which represent more than one company  the company faces competition within each agency in its own agency system 
however  the company s name recognition  medical society endorsements  physician board of directors  agency force and program development have all contributed to helping the company maintain its number of insureds 
furthermore  the company has been successful at target marketing groups and specialties that exhibit above average profitability and believes that its marketing success has allowed it to improve the quality and profitability of its overall business 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its business in florida are service  name recognition  and price  and that it is competitive in florida in all of these areas 
the company enjoys strong name recognition in florida by virtue of having been organized by  and operated for the principal benefit of  florida physicians 
the services offered to insureds of the company  as well as the healthcare community in general  are intended to promote name recognition and to maintain and improve loyalty among the insureds of the company 
mpl insurance offered by fpic has the exclusive endorsement of both the fma and the fda  and is also endorsed by various county and state medical societies 
in both missouri and kansas  intermed and interlex compete with both regional and national companies 
in  the last year for which statistics are available from the missouri department of insurance  there were companies writing medical malpractice insurance in the state 
the top five writers have of the market 
the largest market share was 
intermed  the seventh largest writer in the state in  had a market share of 
ten companies wrote lpl insurance in the state of missouri in according to the latest statistics available from the missouri department of insurance 
one company  sponsored by the missouri bar association  had a market share of 
interlex  which commenced operations in october  had a market share of and was the second largest writer 
a number of hospitals in missouri have purchased the medical practices of fee for service physicians and hired the physicians as employees of the hospital or a corporate entity affiliated with the hospital 
a number of such physicians formerly purchased their own professional liability insurance through smaller insurance companies such as intermed 
as a result of the consolidation  many of the hospitals purchasing the practices of physicians have become self insured or sought professional liability insurance from professional liability carriers with capital and surplus greater than that of intermed and at premiums lower than those currently offered by intermed 
in general  local carriers who have been able to maintain strong customer loyalty dominate the mpl market in other states 
the same targeted specialty and loss free approach developed in florida is being used in these other states 
the company is recruiting and developing an agency force to expand its market  provide service  and develop name recognition 
insurance ratings fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex currently have a financial condition rating from am best of a excellent 
an am best rating is intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and should not be considered an investment recommendation 
am best s ratings are based upon a comprehensive review of a company s financial performance that is supplemented by certain data  including responses to am best s questionnaires  quarterly national association of insurance commissioners naic filings  state insurance department examination reports  loss reserve reports  annual reports and reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
am best undertakes a quantitative evaluation based upon profitability  leverage and liquidity and a qualitative evaluation based upon the composition of an insurer s book of business or spread of risk  the amount  appropriateness and soundness of reinsurance  the quality  diversification and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its loss reserves and policyholders surplus and the experience and competency of its management 
regulation the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive state regulatory oversight in florida  missouri and in the other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
florida and missouri insurance laws regulate insurance holding company structures  including the company and its subsidiaries 
each insurance company in a holding company structure is required to register with its domiciliary department of insurance the department of insurance and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company structure that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the structure 
pursuant to these laws  the department of insurance may examine the company  and or fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex at any time and require disclosure of and or approval of material transactions involving any insurance subsidiary of the company  such as extraordinary dividends from fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex 
all transactions within the holding company structure affecting the company s insurance subsidiaries must be fair and reasonable 
florida insurance laws provide that no person may acquire directly or indirectly five percent or more of the voting securities of a domiciled insurance company unless such person has obtained the prior written approval of the department of insurance for such acquisition 
any purchaser of five percent or more of the company s insurance subsidiaries outstanding common stock will generally be presumed to have acquired control of the insurance company 
in lieu of obtaining such prior approval  a purchaser owning less than of the outstanding shares of the company or fpic  apac  intermed  or interlex may file a disclaimer of affiliation and control with the department of insurance 
missouri insurance laws provide generally no person may acquire directly or indirectly ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domiciled insurance company unless such person has obtained the prior written approval of the department of insurance for such acquisition 
since fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex are insurance companies  the departments of insurance in florida and missouri are their principal supervisors and regulators 
however  these companies are also subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which they transact business in relation to numerous aspects of their business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to insure the financial stability of the insurance companies for the protection of policyholders 
the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  required statutory financial statements and prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted 
although premium rate regulations vary among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval by each state regulator of the rates and policies to be used in its state 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each state in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
in march  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles project the codification as the naic supported basis of accounting 
the codification was approved with a provision allowing for discretion by each states department of insurance in determining appropriate statutory accounting for insurers 
accordingly  such discretion will continue to allow prescribed or permitted accounting practices that may differ from state to state 
the codification will not affect the company s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the impact of the codification on the company s insurance subsidiaries statutory financial statements has not been determined 
because the codification represents a new basis of accounting for statutory financial statements  adoption of the codification may have a significant impact on the insurance subsidiaries statutory financial statements 
although the naic has stated that the adoption date for the codification is january   the implementation date is dependent upon an insurer s state of domicile 
accordingly  the company s adoption date of the codification is dependent upon actions of the insurance departments of the state of florida and missouri and the florida and missouri state legislatures 
the insurance subsidiaries of the company are subject to assessment by the financial guaranty associations in the states in which they conduct business for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies of insolvent insurers 
generally  these associations can assess member insurers on the basis of written premiums in their particular states 
the gramm leach bliley act of the act establishes a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the federal bank holding company act framework to permit a bank holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance  through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
the act may significantly change the competitive  operational and regulatory environment in which the company and its subsidiaries conduct business 
generally  the act i repeals historical restrictions on  and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to  affiliations among commercial banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  ii provides a uniform framework for the functional regulation of commercial banks  insurance companies and securities firms  iii broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and derivatively  state banks  banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  and their financial subsidiaries  and iv addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of insurance companies and other financial institutions 
the insurance industry is under continuous review by congress  state legislatures and state and federal regulatory agencies 
from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed for the insurance industry  some of which could have an effect on insurers or reinsurers 
among the proposals that have in the past been  or are at present being  considered are the possible introduction of state and federal limits on certain damages for mpl as well as federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers 
the company is unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted  the form in which any such proposals would be adopted  or the impact  if any  such adoption would have on the company  although such impact could be material

the company s financial position and results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors 
unexpected high frequency or severity of losses for the company s insurance subsidiaries in any period  particularly in the company s prior three policy years  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  reevaluations of the liability for loss and lae could result in an increase or decrease in liabilities and a corresponding adjustment to earnings 
the company s historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future earnings 
overview fiscal year was another year of growth for the company 
net premiums earned by the company s insurance subsidiaries grew  from million in to million in total revenues increased  from million in to million in net income increased  from million in to million in fully diluted earnings per share increased 
per share from per share in to per share in during  the portion of the company s revenues attributable to areas other than its core physicians mpl market continued to increase 
the net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the company s insurance subsidiaries rose  from million in to million in the company believes that the premiums and earnings growth rates in are not likely to be comparable to those achieved in  which were largely the results of acquisitions 
insurance operations with respect to the company s core mpl business  total insureds increased  from  in to  in of this increase  is attributable to growth at apac and the acquisition of intermed and interlex  which accounted for and of the increase  respectively 
fpic accounted for the balance of the increase 
physician insureds grew  from  in to  in dental insureds grew  from  in to  in net premiums earned on the company s mpl business grew  from million in to million in growth was achieved during in other product areas such as legal defense for healthcare provider licensure investigations  group accident and health insurance coverage and errors omissions and directors officers liability insurance for managed care organizations 
net premiums earned for these products increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the increased health premium 
the company experienced another solid year of underwriting results during  with the frequency of physician claims reported decreasing by from levels 
the decline in claims frequency over the past several years is a positive sign for future claims development 
the primary risk to future positive development of the company s claims expense is unanticipated increases in the average claim payment  also known as severity 
loss experience on the and prior report years is developing as expected and  in some instances  better than expected 
however  while report years   and are not mature enough to accurately project at this time  management believes it is unlikely that the reserves carried for these years will develop to be as materially redundant as has been the case in the past 
the company s combined ratio for fiscal year  calculated using generally accepted accounting principles gaap  declined  from in to in the combined ratio is defined as the sum of net losses and loss adjustment expenses plus other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned 
this positive trend was primarily due to favorable loss and lae experience on the company s core mpl business  the addition of assumed reinsurance  which carries a lower loss and combined ratio than the core mpl business  offset to some extent by adverse results from the company s group accident and health business 
as discussed in the preceding paragraph  management expects that the level of favorable development and corresponding reserve reductions will decline in  therefore  the company s combined ratio can be expected to increase accordingly 
during  the company requested a rate increase on its fda group accident and health program from the florida department of insurance for which it received approval in february this rate increase will begin to take effect for business written or renewed beginning april  however  based upon management s expectation that adverse accident and health claim trends may continue  the company has subsequently announced its intention to withdraw from all its group accident and health programs 
the company s group accident and health programs combined contributed an after tax operating loss of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to an after tax operating gain of 
million for the year ended december  investments the company invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of high grade  taxable and tax exempt  fixed income securities  with a targeted duration of approximately five years 
the majority of these securities are held as invested assets by the various insurance subsidiaries 
at the close of  of the fixed income portfolio was invested in tax exempt securities and in taxable securities 
on a consolidated basis  the company s total investment portfolio grew million from million in to million in apac and tenere accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in the company s total investment portfolio while fpic s portfolio declined million due to sales of bonds in connection with the acquisition of tenere  dividends paid to the company in connection with the acquisition of afp and unrealized losses on fpic s portfolio 
the growth in investments also consisted of a net contribution from the reinvestment of net interest income  a decrease in equity securities of 
million and an increase in other invested assets of 
million 
net investment income earned increased  from million in to million in outlook for florida and missouri mpl markets the company s assessment of the current florida and missouri mpl markets indicates that premium growth may be flat to slightly negative for due to the continuation of intense competition from both the large numbers of carriers already present and new carriers entering these states 
this competition is likely to keep downward pressure on rates during effective january   the insurance subsidiaries of the company did not institute any overall rate increases 
however  certain regions in the various states in which the company does business as well as certain medical specialties did receive rate increases 
within these specialties and regions  the company has continued to realize deteriorating loss experience with loss ratios reaching levels that  over time  could negatively affect earnings 
the company s strategy is to increase pricing on these negatively developing medical specialties and regions to the level where contribution is being made toward covering related fixed expenses 
acquisitions and strategy effective january   the company acquired afp  which is the manager and attorney in fact for physicians reciprocal insurers pri  a new york mpl insurance reciprocal 
pri  which is the second largest mpl carrier for physicians in new york  insures over  physicians and has direct written premiums of approximately million and total assets of approximately million 
the purchase consideration paid by the company for afp consisted of million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
afp derives its income from management fees paid by pri 
the acquisition of afp had a positive impact on the company s operating results 
the company continues to consider and analyze the possibility of sponsoring a conversion of pri to a stock insurer and acquiring it 
such a transaction  although unlikely during the coming year  would be subject to the approval of the company s board of directors and shareholders  as well as pri s board of trustees and policyholders  and the florida and new york departments of insurance and other regulatory authorities 
such an acquisition would give the company direct ownership of a large northeastern mpl insurer and has the potential to further improve the company s operating results 
on march   fpic acquired tenere  which is the holding company for intermed  a missouri mpl insurer with approximately  insureds  and interlex  a missouri lpl insurer with approximately  insureds 
the purchase price for tenere was approximately million in cash 
included in the net assets acquired was approximately million in cash 
contrary to management s initial expectations  tenere contributed an after tax net operating loss of approximately  to the company s consolidated operating results for tenere s loss was primarily the result of a reserve strengthening 
the acquisition of tenere  intermed  and interlex provided the company with approximately million of additional net premiums earned and increased the company s presence in the southern mid west 
the company contemplates prudently expanding the lpl business to the company s other states of operation and to use the company s existing relationships with legal defense attorneys to help market this business 
on august   the company s subsidiary  emi  purchased all of the assets of brokerage services  inc bsi and group brokerage  inc 
gbi  related corporations headquartered in albuquerque  new mexico 
bsi and gbi provide third party administration services for self insured and fully insured health plans 
the consideration paid by emi for such assets aggregated approximately the company continues to believe that the mpl industry is in a consolidation phase and will ultimately be dominated by companies with a national or large regional presence 
during  the company will continue to work to implement its strategy of growing nationally within the mpl industry by expanding writings of its existing carriers geographically and through strategic acquisitions that may become available 
the company views ideal acquisition candidates as companies that are as strong or stronger than the company on a relative basis and seeks acquisitions that are expected to be immediately accretive to earnings 
the acquisitions to date provide the company with infrastructure to expand its products and services to the southeast  northeast and southern midwest 
the company s goal over the next few years is to acquire additional companies to provide management support and operations in the rest of the country 
accomplishing this goal will provide the company with the resources to compete nationally for physicians and healthcare facilities insurance business 
the company views this expansion as the cornerstone of its strategy to meet the growing needs of the consolidating healthcare marketplace 
a secondary acquisition strategy that the company considers viable is the acquisition and consolidation of operations of small to medium sized third party administrators tpas for self insured and fully insured health plans 
the company currently owns two tpas  mccreary and emi  and has identified other tpas that are acquisition candidates 
a number of capital sources are available to finance acquisitions  including internally generated funds  bank credit facilities and newly issued debt and or equity securities 
on june   the company s board of directors approved the extension of a stock repurchase plan pursuant to which the company is authorized to repurchase  at management s discretion  up to  of its shares on the open market over a twelve month period 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares pursuant to this plan at a cost of approximately million 
on september   the company s board of directors approved an additional stock buyback program  pursuant to which the company is authorized to repurchase an additional  shares of its stock on the open market when all available shares have been repurchased under the previously announced program 
on january   the company s board approved a third stock buyback program for an additional  shares  under which the company can repurchase shares upon completion of the first two programs 
subsequent to december   and as of march   the company has repurchased an additional  shares for approximately million  completing the first program plus  shares authorized under the second program 
this leaves  shares that are authorized under the second program  and  shares under the third  for a total of  shares available for repurchase

the liability for losses and lae represents management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all losses incurred but unpaid and considers prior loss experience  loss trends  the company s loss retention levels and changes in frequency and severity of claims

per share  or  from per share for the year ended december  to per share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the payment of losses and lae and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business is the principal need for the company s liquid funds 
cash used to pay these items has been provided by operating activities 
cash provided from these activities was sufficient during to meet the company s needs 
management believes these sources will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for operating purposes for at least the next twelve months 
however  a number of factors could cause increases in the dollar amount of losses and lae and may therefore adversely affect future reserve development and cash flow needs 
management believes these factors include  among others  inflation  changes in medical procedures  increasing use of managed care and adverse legislative changes 
in order to compensate for such risk  the company i maintains what management considers to be adequate reinsurance  ii conducts regular actuarial reviews of loss reserves  and iii maintains adequate asset liquidity by managing its cash flow from operations coupled with the maturities from its fixed income portfolio investments 
the company maintains a  revolving credit facility with five banks to meet certain non operating cash needs as they may arise 
as of december    had been borrowed under this facility at an interest rate of approximately per annum 
the credit facility bears interest at various rates ranging from libor plus to prime plus 
the credit facility terminates on january  the company anticipates that before such time  it would either extend the financing or obtain alternative financing 
the company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with this credit facility but is charged a fee on the unused portion  which ranges from to basis points 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to meet certain financial covenants 
significant covenants are as follows a the company s funded debt to total capital plus funded debt ratio cannot exceed and b net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus ratio cannot exceed at december   the company s subsidiary  intermed  was in technical violation of one of the company s loan covenants 
the company has obtained a waiver for this technical violation bringing intermed and the company into compliance 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and collateralized by the common stock of certain subsidiaries 
at december   the company held approximately million in investments scheduled to mature during the next twelve months  which combined with net cash flows from operating activities  are expected to provide the company with sufficient liquidity and working capital 
as highlighted in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the company generated positive net cash from operations of  in shareholder dividends payable by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain limitations imposed by florida and missouri law 
in  these subsidiaries are permitted  within insurance regulatory guidelines  to pay dividends of approximately  without prior regulatory approval 
the naic has developed risk based capital rbc measurements for insurers  which have been adopted by the florida and missouri departments of insurance 
rbc measurements provide state regulators with varying levels of authority based on the adequacy of an insurer s adjusted surplus 
at december   the company s insurance subsidiaries maintain adjusted surplus in excess of all required rbc thresholds 
accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june  and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
as issued  sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 was issued in june and defers the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  management believes that sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
guaranty fund assessments the company is subject to assessment by the florida insurance guaranty association  inc figa and the missouri property and casualty insurance guaranty association mpciga as well as similar associations in other states where it is licensed  for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies of insolvent insurers 
in addition to the standard assessments  the florida and missouri legislatures may levy special assessments to settle claims caused by certain catastrophic losses 
the company would be assessed on a basis of premium written 
no provision for special assessments was made in the financial statements 
however  damages caused by future catastrophes could subject the company to additional assessments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and conditions  such as interest rates  spreads among various asset classes  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of the company s debt and equity investment portfolio as of december  was  approximately of the portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the company s exposure to equity risk is not material 
the company does not believe it has any foreign currency exposure 
the company does not conduct any operations outside of the united states nor does the company own any non us dollar denominated securities 
generally  the company does not invest in derivatives and does not currently use any hedging strategies in its investment portfolio 
however  the company has invested in one interest rate swap contract to fix the interest rate in connection with its revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company s investments in collateral mortgage obligations and asset backed securities represented approximately one percent of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is predominately fixed income with approximately allocated to the municipal sector 
the balance is diversified through investments in treasuries  agencies  corporates and mortgage backed securities 
the three market risks that can most directly affect the investment portfolio are changes in us interest rates  credit risks and legislative changes impacting the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
adverse impacts to the company resulting from changes in interest rates is primarily controlled through limiting the duration  or average maturity  of the overall portfolio 
the company manages the duration of its portfolio relative to the duration of the anticipated liabilities of the company 
credit risks are controlled through investing in securities with above average credit ratings 
approximately of the portfolio is aaa  is aa  is a and is bbb rated 
from time to time discussion arises in the united states congress relative to changing or modifying the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
while the company is diligent in its efforts to stay current on legislative acts that could adversely impact the tax exempt status of municipal securities  and while it is uncertain as to whether these changes would ultimately affect valuation of municipal securities currently held in the portfolio  at present there are no hedging or other strategies being specifically used to minimize this risk 
if interest rates were to rise basis points  the fair value of the company s fixed maturity securities would decrease approximately  there have been no significant changes to the company s exposure to financial market risks during the year nor does the company anticipate any significant changes in future reporting periods 
the amounts reported as cash flows in the table below for fixed maturities represent par values at maturity date 
the fair values of fixed maturities as disclosed in the table below are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes for comparable securities 
the fair value of the credit facility is based on the amount of cash flows discounted over the applicable term at the company s borrowing rate at december  projected cash flows in thousands december  thereafter total fair value assets fixed maturity securities available for sale         liabilities credit facility   weighted average interest rate fixed maturity securities credit facility year in order to avoid potential year yk problems  the company adopted a year plan the plan covering all of the company s operations 
the aim of the plan was to take steps to prevent the company s processes and systems  with emphasis on mission critical functions  from being impaired due to yk problems 
yk problems result from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the plan considered the readiness of software systems written internally and those provided by third parties to process data and perform date calculations correctly using dates beginning january  and beyond 
hardware  including network servers  pc workstations  network routers  and communication equipment were reviewed to determine that firmware and operating system software were yk compliant 
as of march   the company has not experienced any significant yk problems prior to or after january  the company further believes that it will not experience any material yk problems in its mission critical functions  processes and systems 
the company anticipated that total costs for yk awareness  inventory  assessment  analysis  conversion  testing and contingency planning would be approximately  as of march   approximately  in costs had been incurred 
the company does not anticipate any material costs related to yk 
the costs incurred to address yk problems did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
from a forward looking perspective  yk problems may affect the company for some period of time after january  however  the extent and magnitude of the yk problem is difficult to predict or quantify 
if  despite the company s reasonable efforts under its plan  there are mission critical yk related failures that create substantial disruptions to the company s business  the adverse impact on the company s business could be material
