pharmanetics  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary cardiovascular diagnostics cvdi  develops  manufactures and markets rapid turnaround diagnostics to assess blood clot formation and dissolution 
cvdi s products are a proprietary cardiovascular analyzer and dry chemistry tests known as the thrombolytic assessment system or tas that provide  at the point of patient care  rapid and accurate evaluation of hemostasis 
cvdi is also establishing itself in the emerging field of theranostics  or rapid near patient testing  in which the diagnostic results may influence treatment decisions 
current tests and tests under development are used in the treatment of angina  heart attack  stroke  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary and arterial emboli 
the company is located in raleigh  north carolina  within a  square foot facility housing office space  research labs and manufacturing clean rooms 
in june  the company sold substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of coeur laboratories  inc coeur to coeur acquisition llc  a private investment firm financed by bison investments 
prior to this sale  the company operated coeur as a manufacturer and seller of disposable power injection syringes 
upon the sale of coeur  the company retained coeur s cash  receivables and certain other assets 
the company currently derives income from the following sources tas product sales  interest income  and development income recognized in connection with collaboration agreements 
coeur product sales in  and represented  and  respectively  of total company sales 
the tas technology is used at the point of patient care which provides many potential benefits  including faster results for better treatment of patients  reduced usage of blood products for bleeding complications  quicker patient transfers from costly critical care settings and reduced hospital costs due to less paperwork and personnel time in processing blood samples 
currently  product sales mainly consist of the company s routine test cards  the pt  aptt and hmt tests along with the related controls and analyzers 
upon introduction of these products in and  the company distributed the products through a direct sales force 
however  given a consolidating hospital industry  cvdi determined that distribution arrangements  rather than a direct sales force  were needed to penetrate the market 
in august cvdi signed a global distribution agreement with chiron diagnostics  now known as bayer diagnostics  which has replaced or will replace the distribution agreements which existed prior to such date 
bayer s strength is in critical care areas of the hospital which should facilitate the placement of the tas technology 
in addition  the company s strategy has evolved towards becoming more focused on the development of specialty tests for drugs  some with narrow ranges between over and under dosage 
rapid diagnostic capabilities may improve patient care and turnover  and there is a market trend to obtain diagnostic information faster in order to effect therapy sooner 
the company believes that physicians are beginning to see the need for drug management tools and consequently  the company is seeking greater involvement of physician thought leaders during development 
the company also believes that these trends should allow the company to obtain higher pricing of these specialty tests 
as a result  the company exhibited the flexibility of the tas platform and the potential to expand its menu of specialty tests by signing collaboration agreements with knoll ag  astrazeneca and aventis to monitor the effects of certain new drugs that are in clinical trials or currently being marketed 
increased placement of specialty tests may also further demand for analyzers and routine anticoagulant tests 
the company believes it is well positioned in its development efforts to expand its menu of tests to monitor developmental drugs where rapid therapeutic intervention is needed

the company may acquire other products  technologies or businesses that complement the company s existing and planned products  although the company currently has no understanding  commitment or agreement with respect to any such acquisitions 
in addition  the company may consider a joint venture or the sale of manufacturing rights to complete the commercialization of its routine anticoagulant monitoring tests

if additional liquidity becomes necessary in the future  the company will consider external sources of financing as needed

the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in the company s quarterly operating results as well as other factors which may be unrelated to the company s performance 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of and announcements concerning public companies 
such broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
securities of issuers having relatively limited capitalization or securities recently issued in an initial public offering are particularly susceptible to volatility based on short term trading strategies of certain investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and long term debt 
the company s investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase between three and nine months 
due to the short term nature of the company s debt investments and the company s intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company has long term debt obligations at a fixed interest rate 
given the fixed rate nature of this debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
