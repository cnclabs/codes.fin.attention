item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
our future success as a manufacturer and distributor of value priced  stone set jewelry will be influenced by several factors including technological developments in the mass production of jewelry  our ability to efficiently meet the design and production requirements of our customers  and the market acceptance of our jewelry 
further factors impacting our operations are increases in expenses associated with continued sales growth  our ability to control costs  management s ability to evaluate the public s tastes and orders to target satisfactory profit margins  the ability to develop and manage the introduction of new designed products  and competition 
quality control is also essential to our success  since customers demand compliance with design and product specifications and consistency of production 
in connection with our initial public offering we issued to the underwriters warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at per share and  shares warrants at an exercise price of 
this warrant expires april our utilization of our high volume manufacturing techniques sometimes results in excess inventories 
in the past  we either sold these excess inventories in lots at prices which usually resulted in losses of our investment in labor and overhead and without recovering our full cost of stones  or our internally recycled the metal and most stones by disassembling the product  re melting the gold or silver and removing the stones 
this recycling resulted in additional incurred labor and overhead costs 
once diamante established its factory outlet stores  it provided us with an opportunity to sell our excess inventories on more favorable terms 
by selling to diamante  we avoid the costs and losses that we had incurred in the past and we are afforded a more advantageous method of dealing with our excess inventories 
we are the primary supplier of products to diamante and our account receivable from diamante is fully secured by all the assets of diamante  which security interest has been pledged by us to the bank of nova scotia for our financing facilities 
in addition  we perform certain administrative functions for diamante 
generally  we do not provide products pursuant to long term contracts 
we have an exclusive jewelry supply contract with zellers  inc of canada that  pursuant to its terms  is to terminate in december sales to zellers inc of canada were million in   in   in and  in on november   we acquired substantially all of the assets of the wholesale jewelry division of litton systems  inc  which division had operated under the trade name diamonair  for approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
in accordance with the purchase accounting method  diamonair s results have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
sales of diamonair products in on a non consolidated  unaudited basis were million and the profit margin was approximately 
diamonair purchased products from approximately suppliers 
we have consistently increased the amount of diamonair products manufactured by us using our manufacturing process thus increasing consolidated gross margins 
we have increased sales of diamonair products by introducing the diamonair products into the distribution lines used by the dg division and the aviv division 
on february   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of aviv  inc  by assuming approximately million in debt 
the effective date of the acquisition was june  of aviv s total sales of approximately million  approximately million were attributable to the new york gold and diamond exchange  a retail store at aviv s facilities in houston  texas 
the profit margin on aviv s sales were approximately for the year ended december  we do not anticipate that the cost of many of the aviv products will be reduced significantly by our manufacturing process 
aviv s products generally are made with more expensive metals and stones than our other products 
therefore  savings in the manufacturing process do not result in unit cost reductions that are material in relation to the total price of the aviv jewelry 
we also intend to increase sales of aviv products by introducing the aviv products to the distribution lines used by the dg division and diamonair division 
we continuously review our administrative costs to determine if there are areas where expenses could be reduced through further integration and consolidation of the acquisitions 
although we expect to achieve some level of consolidation  these potential cost reductions are limited in many areas because i operating in the united states and canada limits the advantages of consolidating certain accounting and human resources functions and ii management believes that maintaining the existing aviv and diamonair sales offices and manufacturing facilities will be beneficial for maintenance of those divisions existing customer relationships and will increase our opportunities in the united states 
fluctuations in the canadian dollar against other currencies  especially the us dollar  may have a material effect on our results of operations 
a substantial portion of our sales and purchases are set in us dollars or are influenced by local currency against the us dollar 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and currently do not a have a policy relating to hedging 
results of operations year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  sales for fiscal were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the modest increase in sales is the result of management s decision to decrease sales to some accounts that carried a lower than targeted gross profit 
as a result  the cost of sales decreased by approximately million as compared to the previous fiscal year and the gross profit increased by from in to in 
operating expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this resulted from a more efficient use of the company s selling and administrative personnel including the apportionment of some staff costs to the company s owned internet subsidiary  netjewels 
com  inc and others 
operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal other income recorded in fiscal was primarily the result of the zellers settlement 
there was no other income in fiscal interest expenses decreased by approximately  other expenses decreased by approximately  most of the difference is attributable to a decrease in bad debt expenses 
operating income for the year was  or per share as compared to  or per share on a fully diluted basis in the number of shares outstanding in on fully diluted basis were  as compared to  in fiscal the company decided to write off intangible assets including goodwill  the entire balances of waxes  moulds and leasehold improvements  and the unamortized value of a supply contract which runs until december  
the company reserved fully against the receivable from its owned subsidiary  netjewels 
com  inc in the amount of  the total unusual write offs amounted to  as a result  income before income taxes was  compared to  a decrease of  income taxes decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net income was  in as compared to net income of  in year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  sales for the year ended december  increased by  compared to the year ended december  this increase of was a result of the successful integration of the aviv and diamonair acquisitions  as well as the increase in revenues from alternative customers  such as valuevision 
gross profit increased by  and represented of sales as compared to in the year ended december  operating expenses increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  operating expenses represented of revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this improvement was the result of our ability to control general and administrative costs which were only partially offset by increases in selling expenses 
interest expenses increased by approximately  as a result of increased financing to service our growth 
other expenses increased by  from  to  primarily as a result of the zellers inc of canada s settlement 
we had other income of  in the year ended december   primarily as a result of the settlement with zellers inc canada

as a result of the higher income  income taxes increased from  to  in the year ended december  net income was  in the year ended december  as compared to net income of  in the year ended december  this was an increase of 
liquidity and capital resources in april  we completed an initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase common stock 
we realized net proceeds of million from this offering 
we may realize additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants  although there can be no assurance that such warrants will be exercised 
we currently have an operating line of credit with the bank of nova scotia in the amount of million subject to certain margin requirements 
the amount available to us is equal to to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the line of credit agreement  plus of the inventory values up to a maximum advance against inventory of approximately million 
we utilized the credit line to borrow the million and million necessary for the acquisitions of diamonair and aviv  respectively 
our borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at canadian prime plus which at march  amounted to 
interest on any borrowings is payable monthly 
we are in full compliance with all of the banking covenants including the financial covenants and ratios and are required to report to our bankers on a monthly basis 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by a security interest on all of our assets  guaranteed by diamante  a jewelry retail chain owned by one of our vice presidents and are further secured by a mortgage on the property owned by a limited partnership controlled by jack berkovits and leased to us  which mortgage we have guaranteed 
for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million  accounts receivable increased by million and inventory increased by million 
our accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  or of revenue for the year ended december  accounts receivable is such a large percentage of sales because i accounts receivable include a goods and services tax and a federal excise tax on most canadian sales  which taxes are not included in sales  and ii sales volume is generally higher in the fourth quarter and some customers do not pay us for goods until after the holiday selling season 
our inventory as of december  was million  or of revenue for the year ended december  inventory is such a large percentage of sales because the inventory reflects needs for all three divisions for their anticipated expansion and growth in at december   we had loans outstanding to our principal shareholder  jack berkovits  of million which bear interest at per annum 
in may  we issued  shares of common stock and an aggregate of  warrants exercisable at per share in connection with a private placement offering 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
these warrants are exercisable from may until may we issued  shares of common stock to haymarket  llc   warrants to purchase common stock to haymarket  llc  and  warrants to purchase common stock to oscar gruss son
