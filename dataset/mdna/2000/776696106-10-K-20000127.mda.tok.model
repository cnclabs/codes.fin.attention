item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with roper s consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations general the following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated 
amounts are dollars in thousands and percentages are of net sales 
year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended october  industrial controls net sales    gross profit    operating profit    fluid handling net sales    gross profit    operating profit    analytical instrumentation net sales    gross profit    operating profit    includes results of petrotech from june  and the pmc beta division of metrix from may  operating profit excludes unallocated corporate administrative costs 
such costs were   and  for the years ended october   and  respectively 
includes results of flow technology from december  includes results of the princeton instruments division of roper scientific from may   ids from november   the acton research division of roper scientific from march   the photometrics division of roper scientific from april  and the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisitions from june  year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal of million represented the seventh consecutive year that roper established a record high 
roper core sales excluding sales to gazprom increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  total industrial controls sales decreased due mostly to difficult market conditions throughout the oil gas industry  as oil and natural gas prices were at historical lows in the early part of fiscal  and consolidation within the industry 
each of these factors caused reductions in capital spending by roper s customers during fiscal sales to gazprom were million for the year ended october   down from fiscal as a result of dropping certain low margin  pass through products from the contract 
total analytical instrumentation sales increased due to full year contributions from the fiscal acquisitions of acton research february and photometrics march  the partial year contribution from the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisitions june and improved market conditions for the segment s digital imaging business 
on a pro forma basis  analytical instrumentation sales increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
total fluid handling sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal poor semiconductor equipment industry conditions that affected the fluid handling segment primarily in the first half of fiscal offset the strength in the segment s centrifugal pump business as several new product offerings were very well received by the market 
industrial controls gross profit percentage increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the major reason for the increase was the elimination of certain low margin business with gazprom in fiscal analytical instrumentation gross profit also increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the major contributors to this increase were an inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the realization of cost structure improvements at those businesses acquired over the past two years and volume leverage 
fluid handling gross profit increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this gain resulted from a number of factors  including improved product mix in fiscal from larger diameter centrifugal pumps  an improved power generation market  the leverage of improved semiconductor industry conditions in the second half of fiscal  and improved cost structures throughout the segment 
every one of this segment s businesses improved gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  the consolidated gross profit percentage improvement of points in fiscal was due mostly to increased higher margin analytical instrumentation sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal compared to the year ended october  mostly due to the partial year costs associated with petroleum analyzer 
as a percentage of sales  these costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was attributable mostly to the increased size of the analytical instrumentation segment  whose businesses typically have higher engineering and amortization costs compared to roper s other business segments 
analytical instrumentation sg a costs were and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
comparative percentages for the industrial controls and fluid handling segments were each within point for these years 
excluding russian related reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the industrial controls segment  this segment s sg a costs were about the same in fiscal as fiscal interest expense was about lower during the year ended october  compared to fiscal  with lower interest rates throughout most of fiscal as compared to fiscal the german revolving credit facility opened in june also accrued interest at a relatively low rate compared to us borrowings 
average debt levels were about higher in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the effective income tax rate was for the year ended october  and for the year ended october  the difference between these rates and the differences between the reconciling items between the statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for these years are not considered significant 
average outstanding shares were less in fiscal than fiscal as a result of the repurchase of million shares by roper during the fourth quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal the buy back program was terminated in may other components of comprehensive earnings represented the change in cumulative translation adjustments related to the net assets of non us subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 
the net change during each of fiscal and fiscal was related to roper s subsidiaries in europe and japan 
net cash provided by operating activities declined by million  or  primarily as a result of a million increase in accounts receivable as compared to a million decrease in the fiscal years ended october  and october   respectively 
the reduction in was attributable to exceptional gazprom cash receipts and the increase in arose primarily at roper scientific and integrated designs largely as a result of increased fourth quarter business levels 
the following table summarizes bookings and backlog information dollars in thousands bookings backlog year ended october  october  change change analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     on a pro forma basis to include current year acquisitions for the comparable prior year period  analytical instrumentation segment bookings and backlog were up and down  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated pro forma bookings and backlog were down and down  respectively 
actual compared to pro forma results were about the same for the fluid handling and industrial controls segments 
the increase in analytical instrumentation segment bookings was due to the full year contributions of acton research and photometrics  the partial year contribution of petroleum analyzer and strengthened digital imaging markets in fiscal which also accounts for the pro forma increase 
fluid handling segment bookings increased from its stronger centrifugal pump business and the increased backlog reflected much better semiconductor industry conditions 
decreased industrial controls segment bookings reflected weak oil gas industry conditions 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  roper s core sales increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  total industrial controls sales increased due mostly to the full year results from the may acquisition of petrotech and increased sales to gazprom 
sales to gazprom were million for the year ended october  as gazprom entered into a financing agreement to stabilize this business 
this compared to million in sales during fiscal fluid handling sales increased because of the december acquisition of flow technology  which more than offset sales declines related to this segment s oil gas  power generation and semiconductor capital equipment markets 
analytical instrumentation sales increased largely because of the full year or partial year results of four then recent acquisitions 
changes in overall gross profit derived mainly from the impact of the recently acquired companies and increased sales to gazprom 
the gross profit percentage for the industrial controls segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was adversely affected by petrotech  which was acquired in may and historically experiences lower returns than the segment s other units 
excluding petrotech  industrial controls gross profit percentage would have been compared to for fiscal most of the other decline stemmed from lower margins at compressor controls as a result of lower margins on gazprom business from increased engineering and procurement services in fiscal the decline in fluid handling s gross profit percentage was not significant despite some difficult market conditions that affected several of this segment s units that more than offset strong results from flow technology 
the gross profit percentage for analytical instrumentation decreased primarily because of results of acton research  photometrics and princeton instruments  which reported combined gross profit of 
photometrics and princeton instruments were merged into a single company named roper scientific 
analytical instrumentation s gross profit was also adversely affected by about on an inventory write down at roper scientific that was identified upon implementation of better business systems 
petrotech had the greatest effect that caused the decrease in roper s overall gross profit percentages in compared to other large factors were the lower margins at compressor controls and the inventory write down at roper scientific 
sg a expenses increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   primarily because of the expenses associated with the then recent acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase resulted largely from additional reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to a further deterioration of economic conditions in russia and the region that cast doubt on the collectibility of certain accounts receivable related to sales in interest expense increased million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  principally because of higher debt levels that resulted from the acquisition of seven companies during fiscal and interest rates were slightly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because of more favorable terms negotiated into the us revolving credit facility agreement in may libor rates became lower late in fiscal  but the effects on fiscal results were not significant 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal there were also no significant differences between years in the reconciling items between the statutory rate and the effective rate for these years 
sales order bookings were million during the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   an increase of 
on a pro forma basis  to include acquisitions for similar periods in the prior year  bookings were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal industrial controls bookings were up on a pro forma basis because of petrotech  which booked a large project  and compressor controls  because of increased business with gazprom following gazprom establishing new financing arrangements early in the year 
fluid handling s bookings were up down on a pro forma basis compared to fiscal the acquisition of flow technology offset lower bookings at integrated designs caused by the depressed business conditions in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
bookings within analytical instrumentation increased down on a pro forma basis 
whereas the increase resulted from acquisitions  the pro forma decrease reflected weak business conditions for all of the companies in this segment 
sales order backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  on a pro forma basis  backlog was lower than fiscal pro forma backlog at industrial controls was down despite a significant increase at petrotech that resulted from increased bookings discussed above 
backlog related to russia region shipments was down million compared to fiscal  largely because of delayed shipments at october  that were shipped during the first quarter of fiscal excluding the russia region decrease in backlog  actual and pro forma backlog at industrial controls was up and at october  compared to october   respectively 
fluid handling s pro forma backlog was lower at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal largely because of an decline in the backlog at integrated designs 
pro forma backlog was lower at analytical instrumentation due to the lower level of bookings 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources october  compared to october  working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  october cash was unusually high due to long term borrowings made immediately prior to october  that were used to fund the acquisition of redlake imaging in early november 
accounts receivable increased as a result of strong fourth quarter digital imaging sales and the balances at the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisitions that more than offset the effects of lower fourth quarter oil gas related sales 
the increase in notes payable and current portion of long term debt at october  compared to reflected borrowings under the million german revolving credit facility that was opened in june roper utilizes a million us revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to provide most of its external financing requirements 
total borrowings under this agreement were million at october  and an additional million was borrowed subsequent to october  to fund the acquisition of masd 
the german revolving credit facility was amended subsequent to october  to increase its size to million 
total borrowings under the german facility were million at october  the debt to total capitalization ratio was including the november borrowings of million at october  compared to at october  during fiscal  roper s largest customer  gazprom  put in place a long term financing for its purchase of turbomachinery controls sourced from roper s compressor controls unit 
this financing has facilitated a more consistent supply of product to gazprom 
this financing arrangement is expected to be available over the next several years for additional turbomachinery controls purchases 
however  given unstable political and economic conditions in russia  roper s future shipments to gazprom will continue to be subject to these political  economic and other uncertainties  which could adversely affect the timing and amount of future shipments and cannot be assured 
roper believes its capital expenditures requirements are modest for an industrial products company and were million for the year ended october  although the increased size of the business will drive increased capital expenditure requirements  roper does not believe there will be a change in the order of magnitude of capital expenditures in fiscal in november  roper s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock from per share to per share 
this represents the seventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper s initial public offering 
roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining unused credit under its us and german revolving credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although roper maintains an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on roper s activities  financial condition and results of operations 
roper may also explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources 
roper anticipates that the newly acquired companies as well as the existing companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which roper historically has experienced 
however  the rate at which roper can reduce its debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty 
the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities that will be applicable to roper in fiscal  as amended by sfas once adopted  this standard is not expected to significantly affect roper s financial position  operating results or disclosures 
see note to roper s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this pronouncement 
year issues yk issues during recent years  roper instigated processes to ensure that its operations would not be exposed to material adverse effects as a result of yk issues 
in total  the past costs associated with yk compliance  including capital expenditures  were less than million 
all of roper s business and infrastructure systems have operated substantially as normal since january  in general  roper has very few products that are date sensitive and most of those products do not rely on the date for their performance 
accordingly  roper does not believe that it has any materially increased liability for product warranty 
generally  roper is not aware of any potential disruptions in the businesses due to problems with yk issues which could have a materially adverse effect on its operations 
however  roper cautions that it is not presently possible to evaluate whether all of its customers and or vendors have been unaffected by any yk issues which could  in turn  have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
market risks at october   roper s interest rate swap agreements represented a potential asset 
this asset value is directly related to changes in interest rates 
a sufficient decline in interest rates would cause the current asset position to become a liability position 
upon adoption of sfas  the value attributed to the swap agreements will be reflected in roper s balance sheet and changes in this valuation will mostly be reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings 
the swap agreements are intended to reduce the volatility of interest payments related to its long term borrowings 
see note to roper s notes to consolidated financial statements 
at october   roper s total borrowings exceeded the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements 
these borrowings are generally at current market rates and these rates have increased subsequent to october  some of roper s fiscal sales were denominated in a currency other than us dollars mostly euro  uk sterling and japanese yen and some of roper s net assets at october  were maintained in a functional currency other than us dollars mostly euro and us sterling 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has not historically been significant to roper s operations or net assets 
the traded price of roper s common stock influences the effects on roper s financial statements and disclosures with regard to roper s stock option programs and certain cash compensation arrangements 
outlook fiscal is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings 
the november acquisitions of redlake imaging and masd are expected to be immediately accretive to earnings 
the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisition will be included in roper s results for the entire year and increased quoting activity by roper s oil gas businesses is expected to generate additional bookings and revenues but not during the first fiscal quarter 
roper expects to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions and their impact on roper s results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted 
forward looking information the information provided elsewhere in this annual report  in other roper filings with the securities and exchange commission  and in other press releases and public disclosures contains forward looking statements about roper s businesses and prospects as to which there are numerous risks and uncertainties which generally are beyond roper s control 
some of these risks include the level and timing of future business with gazprom and other eastern european customers  changes in interest rates  yk effects and the future operating results of the newly acquired companies 
there is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on roper s future operations  financial condition  or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding interest rate swap agreements and its outstanding variable rate borrowings to the extent that such borrowings exceed the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements 
roper is exposed to foreign exchange risks pertaining to its business denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
roper is exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock 
roper s interest rate swap agreements provide that roper pays a fixed interest rate in exchange for receiving a variable interest rate on a total notional value of million 
these agreements mature in and the other party has options to extend the agreements until at october   the fixed rate obligation of roper was less than the variable rate roper was entitled to receive 
as a result  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was determined to be an asset value of million assuming the options are not exercised 
at october   an interest rate movement up or down by basis points would have increased or decreased the asset value by about  upon adoption of sfas  changes in the valuation of the interest rate swap agreements will be a direct charge to other comprehensive earnings 
immediately after giving effect to the million of additional borrowings in november to finance the acquisition of masd  roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings exceeded the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements by about million 
based on this level of debt  an increase or decrease in interest rates by basis points would increase or decrease annualized interest expense by about  roper and its subsidiary companies generally do not enter into significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar or their functional currency 
non us dollar balances and transactions at october  and for the year then ended were principally denominated in western european or japanese currencies 
at october  and for the year then ended  of roper s consolidated net assets and cumulative translation adjustments were less than and sales were denominated in these currencies 
roper expects that these currencies will remain relatively stable 
therefore  foreign exchange risks are not expected to have a material effect on roper s financial statements 
equity markets are influenced by many factors and changes in roper s stock price may be influenced by factors other than roper s historical earnings and by factors not within roper s control 
the volatility of roper s common stock prices preceding an option grant is directly related to the valuation of that grant for purposes of determining pro forma earnings disclosures 
roper s stock prices following an option grant directly influence the dilutive effect of these options for earnings per share calculations 
the sensitivity of these issues to a change in roper s stock price are not readily determinable  but a change in roper s stock price by is not believed to have a material effect on roper s financial statements or disclosures
