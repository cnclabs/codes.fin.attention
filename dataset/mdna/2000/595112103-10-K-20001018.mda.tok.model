intersegment sales are primarily comprised of sales from the company s semiconductor operations segment to the company s pc operations segment 
intersegment sales for also include sales between the company s former contract manufacturing subsidiary and other segments 
see notes to consolidated financial statements operating segment and geographic information 
unless otherwise stated  all semiconductor production data reflects production of the company and its joint ventures 
net sales consolidated net sales increased by comparing to and comparing to  due to increases in net sales from semiconductor operations  partially offset by decreases in net sales from pc operations 
net sales from semiconductor operations increased for as compared to  primarily due to a increase in total megabits of semiconductor memory sold and  to a lesser extent  a increase in average selling prices 
the company achieved higher megabit sales through ongoing transitions to successive reduced die size shrink versions of existing memory products  shifts to higher density products and increases in total wafer outs 
the increase in wafer outs was primarily due to increased capacity utilization of the company s international and joint ventures facilities 
the company s primary memory product in and was the meg synchronous dram sdram  which constituted approximately and  respectively  of net sales for semiconductor operations 
the company s primary memory product in was the meg dram inclusive of both edo dram and sdram which constituted approximately of semiconductor operations net sales 
the company s average selling prices for the meg sdram increased by in from the meg sdram constituted of net sales for semiconductor operations in and is expected to be the company s primary product in net sales from semiconductor operations increased for as compared to  due primarily to a increase in total megabits of semiconductor memory sold  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products 
the company achieved higher megabit sales through an increase in megabit production as a result of ongoing transitions to successive shrink versions of existing memory products  shifts to higher average density products and  to a lesser extent  additional output from international operations and joint ventures acquired in net sales from pc operations for were lower compared to primarily due to a decrease in overall average selling prices for the company s pc systems and a decrease in unit sales of pc systems 
average selling prices for desktop systems  which are the pc operations primary product  declined in desktop and notebook unit sales decreased by and  respectively  in decreased sales of pc systems were partially offset by a million increase in revenue from internet access and web hosting services in net sales from pc operations for were lower compared to primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for the company s pc systems and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in unit sales 
the decrease in unit sales in is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of desktop systems  which was partially offset by an increase in sales of server systems 
gross margin change change amounts in millions gross margin  as a of net sales the increase in overall gross margin for as compared to is attributable to semiconductor operations and is partially offset by a decrease in gross margin for pc operations 
the increase in overall gross margin for compared to was primarily attributable to semiconductor operations 
gross margin for semiconductor operations increased by in as compared to due to the increase in megabit sales and a higher gross margin percentage 
the gross margin percentage for semiconductor operations increased to in from in  primarily due to comparative decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency and  to a lesser extent  a increase in average selling prices 
manufacturing cost improvements were achieved principally through transitions to shrink versions of existing products and shifts to higher average density products 
subject to specific terms and conditions  mti has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by two joint venture wafer fabrication facilities tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
tech and kmt semiconductor limited kmt 
tech and kmt are collectively referred to herein as the jvs 
the jvs supplied in excess of of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in mti purchases semiconductor memory products from the jvs at prices generally determined quarterly and based on a discount from mti s average selling prices 
mti provides certain technology  engineering support and training to the jvs 
mti also performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by the jvs 
all transactions with the jvs are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from the jvs 
the company realized lower gross margins on sales of jv products than for products manufactured by its wholly owned facilities in and the gross margin percentage for semiconductor operations increased to in from in due to decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvement in manufacturing efficiency 
manufacturing improvements were achieved principally through shifts to higher average density products and transitions to shrink versions of existing products 
cost reductions from manufacturing improvements were slightly offset by higher per unit manufacturing costs at the company s international operations and the decrease in average selling prices in from the gross margin percentage for pc operations decreased to in from in the company continues to experience pricing pressure on its pc systems resulting in the decline in average selling prices 
additionally  gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by a decline in from in unit sales of notebooks systems  which typically have higher gross margin percentages than other pc products 
lower overall pc sales in also adversely affected gross margin 
the gross margin percentage for pc operations increased to for from in  primarily due to lower component costs and a change in the sales mix towards higher margin systems  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
selling  general and administrative change change amounts in millions selling  general and administrative as a of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to resulted primarily from increased employee compensation costs 
compensation costs for semiconductor operations increased in as a result of higher levels of performance based pay and increased administrative personnel 
compensation costs for pc operations also increased in as a result of additional personnel associated with several acquired businesses 
additionally  selling  general and administrative costs in included million for the market value of mei common stock contributed by mti to the micron technology foundation the foundation  increased selling costs resulting from higher production volumes in semiconductor operations and increased legal costs associated with product and process technology rights 
the company expects legal fees to increase over the next several quarters as a result of pending process technology litigation 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses associated with semiconductor operations increased significantly in as compared to primarily as a result of million in added expenses associated with international operations acquired in early selling  general and administrative expenses for pc operations decreased substantially in primarily as a result of enhanced operational efficiencies  cost reductions and the sale of of mei s interest in its contract manufacturing subsidiary in research and development change change amounts in millions research and development as a of net sales substantially all the company s research and development efforts relate to its semiconductor operations 
research and development expenses vary primarily with personnel costs  the number of development wafers processed and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to an increased number of development wafers processed and higher compensation expenses reflecting higher levels of performance based pay and an increased number of personnel 
the company increased research and development efforts in to address its expanding number of product offerings 
process technology research and development efforts are focused on 
u and 
u line width process technologies  which will enable the company to transition to next generation products 
application of advanced process technology currently is concentrated on design of shrink versions of the company s meg sdrams and on design and development of the company s flash  meg and meg sdrams  ddr sdram and sram memory products 
other research and development efforts are currently devoted to the design and development of embedded memory  rdram  and advanced dram technology adt products 
the company is also developing technology which enables the use of standard memory products and new memory applications 
in  the company substantially completed the transition of its manufacturing operations from 
u to 
u line width process technology and began its transition to 
u line width process technology for its primary products 
the company expects to continue its transition to 
u line width process technology in the company anticipates that it will move to 
u line width process technology in the next few years as needed for the development of future generation semiconductor products 
other operating expense income other operating income for includes a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s facility located in richardson  texas and net pre tax losses of million from the write down and disposal of other semiconductor operations equipment 
other operating expense for includes a million charge from the write down and disposal of flat panel display assets  a loss of million from the write down and disposal of semiconductor operations equipment and a million charge resulting from the discontinuation of the company s rfid efforts 
other operating expense for includes a loss of million from the write down and disposal of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and charges associated with the company s pc operations of million resulting from employee termination benefits and consolidation of domestic and international operations 
gain on investments and subsidiary stock transactions during mti recognized a gain of million on its contribution of million shares of mei common stock the contribution to the micron technology foundation 
the contribution decreased mti s ownership interest in mei from approximately to 
selling  general and administrative expense for reflects a charge of million for the market value of the stock contributed 
in february  mei sold of its interest in its contract manufacturing subsidiary  micron custom manufacturing services  inc for cash proceeds of million  resulting in a pre tax gain to the company of million approximately million after taxes and minority interests 
income tax provision benefit the effective tax rates for   and were  and respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate for is principally a result of favorable tax treatment on permanently reinvested earnings from certain of the company s foreign operations 
the company currently expects to continue to realize favorable tax treatment from certain foreign operations 
nevertheless  taxes on earnings of certain foreign operations and domestic subsidiaries not consolidated for tax purposes may cause the effective tax rate to vary significantly from year to year

liquidity and capital resources as of august   the company had cash and liquid investments totaling billion  representing an increase of million during the company s principal source of liquidity during was net cash flow from operations of billion 
property  plant and equipment expenditures of billion were the principal use of funds during in  the company s receivables and inventory increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of the company s increased scale of operations and higher levels of production 
in  the company s convertible subordinated notes due july were converted into million shares of the company s common stock  thereby reducing long term debt by million 
in addition  on october   the company s convertible subordinated notes due october  with a principal amount outstanding of million  were converted into approximately million shares of common stock 
the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development and product and process technology 
to this end the company is considering various capacity expansion programs and capital improvements to its manufacturing facilities including converting some of its operations to millimeter wafer processing 
the company continuously evaluates the financing of these activities and in this regard has a shelf registration statement in place pursuant to which the company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities for up to billion 
the company may seek to raise additional funds through issuing debt or equity securities beyond those covered by the existing shelf registration statement 
the company spent approximately billion in fiscal for purchases of equipment and construction and improvement of buildings and expects capital spending to exceed billion in as of august   the company had contracts extending into fiscal of approximately billion for equipment purchases and software infrastructure and approximately million for the construction of facilities 
on october   mti and kobe steel announced that they had entered into a non binding term sheet providing for the purchase by mti of all of kobe steel s equity interest in kmt for approximately million 
in addition  it is anticipated that mti will assume or repay all of kmt s debt  projected to approximate million at closing 
assuming satisfaction of all applicable terms and conditions  closing is expected to occur in march there can be no assurance  however  that the pending transaction with kobe steel will be consummated 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations recent events 
as of august   approximately million of the company s consolidated cash and liquid investments were held by mei 
cash generated by mei is not readily available to finance operations or other expenditures of the company s semiconductor operations 
mei has a million unsecured credit agreement  expiring june  which contains certain restrictive covenants pertaining to mei  including certain financial ratios and limitations on the amount of dividends declared or paid by the company 
as of august   mei had no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the volatile nature of the dram industry could adversely affect our future operating results the dram industry is highly volatile 
due to the commodity nature of dram products  when the supply of dram products exceeds the demand for such products  average selling prices for dram products decline  sometimes rapidly 
in the past  our operating results and cash flows have been adversely affected by excess worldwide dram supply  and declines in average selling prices for dram products 
we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business although average per megabit selling prices for memory products increased in  they have decreased approximately per year on a long term basis 
further  we have experienced significant fluctuations in average selling prices 
these fluctuations include periods when decreases exceeded the long term rate for several consecutive years as shown in following chart fiscal year to year comparison average price per megabit decline to to to to we are unable to predict pricing conditions for any future period 
if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit manufacturing costs  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 
increased worldwide dram production could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram we and our competitors constantly seek to improve yields  reduce die size and use fewer manufacturing steps 
these improvements increase worldwide supply of dram 
in addition  we and several of our competitors are evaluating plans to manufacture semiconductors in facilities that process millimeter mm wafers as opposed to the current industry standard mm wafers 
mm wafers have approximately greater usable surface area than mm wafers and their widespread use in the industry  which is expected to occur within the next two to five years  will lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram 
increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram capacity expansion  either by way of new facilities  increased capacity utilization  or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production 
we are currently evaluating several capacity expansion programs for our various fabrication facilities 
increases in worldwide supply of dram could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent on the personal computer pc market as most of the memory products we sell are used in pcs or peripherals 
if either the growth rate of pcs sold or the amount of memory included in each pc decreases  sales of our memory products could decrease we sold most of our memory products to pc or peripheral markets in drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory component in pcs 
industry forecasts indicate that the amount of memory included in each pc will remain relatively stable in if either the growth rate of pcs sold or the amount of memory included in each pc decreases  sales of our memory products could decrease 
if any one of our major pc original equipment manufacturer oem customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we supply several major pc oems with more than of their memory requirements 
sales to two of our pc oem customers approximated of our semiconductor operation s net sales in if any one of our major pc oem customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if our supply of memory products from our joint ventures is interrupted  our results of operations could be adversely affected we participate in two joint ventures that currently supply us with in excess of of our total megabits of memory produced 
we have agreements to purchase all of the production from the joint ventures subject to specific terms and conditions 
the joint ventures have historically required and presently are required to seek additional financing to fund their ongoing operations and transition to next generation technologies 
our source of supply may be interrupted if either joint venture is unable to repay or refinance existing debt or obtain required incremental financing 
in addition  our supply from each joint venture may be interrupted if the joint venture s operations experience a disruption in its manufacturing process 
any reduction in supply could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to make adequate capital investments  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must invest significant capital in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
we must make substantial capital investments to convert manufacturing operations to mm wafer processing over the next several years 
we made billion in capital investments in and currently estimate that such investments will exceed billion in if we are unable to make adequate capital investments  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs of our memory products at an acceptable rate  our results of operations could be adversely affected to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs we must design and develop new generation products  reduce the die size of our existing products  and increase the production of these products at acceptable rates to acceptable yields 
if these efforts are unsuccessful  we may be unable to sufficiently reduce per megabit manufacturing costs and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if our manufacturing process is interrupted  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require advanced and costly equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or interrupt production and affect our ability to deliver products on time or cost effectively 
additionally  if production at a fabrication facility is interrupted  we may be unable to meet demand and customers may purchase products from other suppliers 
the resulting loss of revenues and damage to customer relationships could be significant 
our transition to higher bandwidth products may adversely affect our manufacturing efficiency the semiconductor memory industry is currently transitioning to higher bandwidth products  including double data rate synchronous dram ddr sdram and direct rambus registered trademark dram rdram registered trademark 
we may have trouble achieving the same manufacturing efficiencies in higher bandwidth products as other memory products 
our transition to higher bandwidth products may adversely impact our productivity levels  die per wafer yields  backend assembly  and test equipment requirements 
our transition to higher bandwidth products could increase per megabit production costs and we may not achieve our historical rate of cost per megabit reductions 
we increased megabit production in recent years through improvement to our manufacturing process  but we may not be able to increase production at the same rate in the future in recent years  we have increased our megabit production through improvements in our manufacturing processes  including reducing the die size of our existing products 
as a result  we have decreased per megabit production costs and significantly increased our megabit production 
however  we may not be able to increase megabit production at historical rates in the future 
our ability to increase megabit production in future periods may be limited because of the following factors our substantial completion of product and process technology upgrades in our international and jv facilities  our commitment of more wafer starts to our flash and sram products  our manufacturing yields may decrease as we implement more complex technologies  or our ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices to commercial volumes 
an adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition occasionally  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that our products or our processes infringe their product or process technology rights 
in this regard  we are is currently engaged in litigation with rambus  inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents 
lawsuits between rambus and us are pending in the united states  germany  france  the united kingdom and italy 
we also have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements 
some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic royalty payments 
we may also need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us 
a determination that our manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and or require us to make material changes to our products and or manufacturing processes 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we are not able to purchase technologically advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment  our results of operations could be harmed our semiconductor manufacturing operations require highly advanced  complex  and costly semiconductor equipment 
if we want to continue to be a low cost producer of semiconductor memory products  we will need to be able to replace obsolete equipment and purchase the most technologically advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
however  there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of providing this critical equipment 
we will compete with other semiconductor manufacturers for the supply of this advanced manufacturing equipment  and recent market conditions have reduced availability of this equipment 
additionally  the expected industry wide conversion to mm wafer manufacturing over the next several years could also limit the availability of semiconductor equipment  as equipment suppliers are just beginning to produce mm equipment in volume 
equipment shortages have occurred from time to time in the past and lead times for ordering new equipment are typically to months 
we will need to place orders for new equipment several months in advance to ensure timely delivery  which may limit our ability to alter plans in response to changes in market conditions 
our supply of new equipment could be significantly delayed if any shortages occur 
any equipment delays could limit our ability to use the most cost effective processes and limit our ability to expand our capacity 
interruptions in our supply of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations our semiconductor operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards 
we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials  however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
various factors  including increases in worldwide semiconductor manufacturing  could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames and molding compound 
raw materials shortages have not interrupted our operations in the past 
nevertheless  shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
also  lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if our supply of raw materials is interrupted or our lead times extended  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or hire qualified new employees  our operating results could be adversely affected we depend on a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in our worldwide operations  particularly as we add different product types 
competition for skilled management and technical employees is intense within our industry 
other employers have increased recruitment of our existing personnel 
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could adversely affect our operating results international sales approximated of our consolidated net sales in we expect international sales to continue to increase 
in addition  we support manufacturing operations in italy  singapore  japan and scotland 
our international sales and international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including currency fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations and restrictions on the transfer of funds  employee turnover and labor unrest  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  compliance with a variety of international laws  and political and economic instability 
these factors may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if average selling prices of memory products decline  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations historically we have invested substantially all cash flow from semiconductor operations in capacity expansion and enhancement programs 
our cash flow from operations depends primarily on average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs of our semiconductor memory products 
if average selling prices decline at a faster rate than our per megabit manufacturing costs  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to sustain our operations 
we may be unable to obtain other external sources of liquidity to fund our operations or efforts to enhance our capacity and product and process technology 
without additional financing  we may be unable to invest sufficiently in capacity expansion and enhancement programs  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to compete effectively in the highly competitive semiconductor memory industry  our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from a number of companies  including hitachi  ltd  hyundai electronics industries co  ltd  infineon technologies ag  nec corporation and samsung semiconductor  inc some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
in addition  a number of these competitors have historically been able to introduce new products before we have 
consolidations in the semiconductor memory industry could weaken our position against competitors 
if we fail to compete effectively  our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 
products that do not meet specifications or that contain  or are rumored to contain  defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex  it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects  or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
if  despite design review  quality control and product qualification procedures  problems with nonconforming  defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products  we could be adversely affected in one or both of the following ways we may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product 
we may encounter adverse publicity  which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 
if our subsidiary  micron electronics  inc  fails to compete effectively in the highly competitive pc and e services industry  our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected our results of operations are affected by  micron electronics  inc mei  our owned subsidiary 
in  we reduced our ownership in mei from to through contributions to the micron technology foundation 
we anticipate that we will further reduce our ownership share in mei through contributions to the foundation 
mei is a publicly traded pc and e services business 
mei s results of operations  and the resulting effect upon our consolidated results of operations  are linked to mei s ability to compete effectively in the pc and e services markets 
mei s success depends on its ability to accurately forecast technology trends  design and introduce new pc products and correctly identify demand for such products  effectively manage materials and finished goods inventories  manufacturing constraints  and component costs  effectively market pc products directly to end customers and gain market share  and identify value added e services solutions  build an e services infrastructure to deliver such solutions and generate e services customers at acceptable margins 
if mei fails to compete effectively in the pc and e services industry  our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected 
one of our shareholders owns a large portion of our common stock  which could limit our ability to raise additional capital as of october   texas instruments incorporated held approximately million shares of common stock  representing approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this amount includes approximately million shares of common stock issuable to texas instruments as a result of the conversion of notes on october  we have not registered these shares with the securities and exchange commission  and texas instruments has registration rights with respect to this common stock 
our ability to raise additional capital in the equity market may be affected by the number of shares held by texas instruments 
if we are unable to successfully transition our semiconductor operations to mm wafer manufacturing processes  the results of our operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes 
by transitioning to larger wafers  we should be able to produce significantly more die for each wafer at only a slightly higher cost for each wafer  resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die 
several of our competitors have announced intentions to shift part or all of their memory manufacturing operations to mm wafers in the near future 
some of these competitors have established pilot mm wafer lines 
if these competitors are able to transition operations to mm wafers before us  we could be at a cost disadvantage 
our transition to mm wafer processing will require us to make substantial capital investments  which will depend on our ability to raise funds 
we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations and reduced yields during our initial transition stage to larger wafer sizes 
if we are unable to successfully transition to mm wafer processing  our results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 
the dram market is expected to undergo considerable market segmentation in the near future 
if we fail to accurately predict and meet market demand for various products  the results of our operations and cash flows could be harmed the dram market in the past has been characterized by production of large volumes of one dominant part type with the lowest possible megabit cost 
we expect the dram market to partially transition its focus from the production of one dominant part type to a market with several different part types based on a variety of new technologies 
these new technologies include pc sdram  double data rate ddr dram  and rambus registered trademark dram 
we also expect to support a larger number of product densities in the future 
this segmentation of the dram market is expected to continue in future periods  as our memory products are used in a wide variety of different products 
if we are to maintain our large market share with major oem customers we must offer a broader range of products to meet the memory requirements of these oems 
it takes several months  or even years  to develop and qualify new products 
if we are unable to accurately predict the demand for new products or the technologies on which these new products are based  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected given the long lead times associated with product development 
new technologies could affect demand for our semiconductor memory products and have an adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flows we and our competitors need to spend substantial resources to develop new semiconductor memory technologies 
if our competitors introduce new products and processes before us  demand for our products could decrease and our results of operations could be harmed 
we expect our competitors will continue to develop new products and processes in the future 
while we will continue to invest substantially in our own research and development efforts  we cannot guarantee that our new products and processes will be competitive
