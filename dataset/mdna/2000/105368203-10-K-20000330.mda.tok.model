funds from operations management considers funds from operations ffo as one measure of reit performance 
ffo is calculated as net income loss adjusted for depreciation expense attributable to real property  amortization expense attributable to capitalized leasing costs  gains on sales of real estate investments  and extraordinary items and comparable adjustments for real estate ventures accounted for using the equity method 
management believes that ffo is a useful disclosure in the real estate industry  however  the company s disclosure may not be comparable to other reit s 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the following table summarizes ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except share data income before gains on sale  minority interest and extraordinary item   add deduct depreciation attributable to real property   attributable to real estate ventures  amortization attributable to leasing costs   funds from operations before minority interest   weighted average common shares including common share equivalents and operating partnership units   year compliance the company has not experienced any problems relating to the year issue on or after january  the company implemented its year compliance program and intends to maintain its contingency plans until it is satisfied that company operations will not be adversely impacted by the possibility of a year issue 
inflation a majority of the company s leases provide for escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measure 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases 
interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects the company s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
the company s financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages and million in floating rate mortgage notes  and million borrowed under its credit facility 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the company has entered into interest rate swap and rate cap agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rates changes on its variable rate debt 
at december   the company had two interest rate swap agreements for notional principal amounts aggregating million 
the swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on million of credit facility borrowings at until november and on million at until november the interest rate caps effectively fix the interest rate on two variable rate mortgages 
one rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a notional value of million at until april and then at until maturity in april the second interest rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a notional value of million at until july the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous move in interest rates from their actual levels at december  with all other variables held constant 
as of december   a increase in actual interest rates would result in a decrease in beneficiaries equity of million and a decrease in actual interest rates would result in an increase in beneficiaries equity of million 
based on the company s variable rate debt as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest expense per year and a decrease would reduce interest expense by million per year
