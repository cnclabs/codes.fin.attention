item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis by our management is provided to identify certain significant factors which affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
overview and risk factors we are a biopharmaceutical company advancing oncology care by developing a portfolio of targeted biologic treatments  which address the unmet medical needs of patients with a variety of cancers 
our three programs include growth factor blockers  cancer vaccines and anti angiogenesis therapeutics 
since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
we have not derived any commercial revenue from product sales 
as a result of our substantial research and development costs  we have incurred significant operating losses and we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately million for the period from our inception to december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses 
substantially all of our revenues were generated from license and research arrangements with collaborative partners 
such revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the status of development of our various products the time at which we enter into research and license agreements with corporate partners that provide for payments to us  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments to us under these agreements whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us the addition or termination of research programs or funding support variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary products during any given period before we can commercialize our products and begin to sell them to generate revenues  they will need additional development and clinical testing  which will require significant additional funds 
generally  to make a profit we will need to successfully develop  test  introduce and market our products 
it is not certain that any of our products will be successfully developed or that required regulatory approvals to commercialize them can be obtained 
further  even if we successfully develop a product  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture or market that product or that customers will buy it 
in december  we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa  a german based drug company  relating to the development  marketing and sale of imc c under this agreement we have retained the rights to develop and market imc c within the united states and canada  we have granted merck kgaa exclusive rights  except in japan  to develop and market imc c outside of the united states and canada  we have agreed to supply merck kgaa  and merck kgaa will purchase from us  imc c for the conduct of clinical trials and the commercialization of the product outside of the united states and canada  we will co develop and co market imc c in japan with merck kgaa  and we have granted merck kgaa an exclusive license outside of the united states and canada  without the right to sublicense  to certain of our patents to apply to a humanized antibody to the egf receptor on which merck kgaa has performed preclinical studies 
in return  merck kgaa has agreed  subject to the terms of the agreement  to pay us million in up front fees and early cash based milestone payments based upon our achievement of the milestones set forth in the agreement  pay us an additional million if further milestones are achieved for which merck kgaa will receive equity in imclone which will be priced at varying premiums to the then market price of the common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones  provide us  subject to certain terms  a guaranty of our obligations under a million credit facility relating to the construc tion of a new imc c commercial manufacturing facility  fund clinical development of imc c outside of the united states and canada  and pay us royalties on future sales of imc c in its territory  if any 
this agreement may be terminated by merck kgaa in various instances  including at its discretion on any date on which a milestone is achieved in which case no milestone payment will be made  for a one year period after first commercial sale of imc c in merck kgaa s territory  upon merck kgaa s reasonable determination that the product is economically unfeasible in which case merck kgaa is entitled to receive back of the cash based milestone payments then paid to date  but only out of revenues received  if any  based upon a royalty rate applied to the gross profit from imc c sales or imc c license fees in the united states and canada  or in the event we do not obtain certain collateral license agreements  in which case merck kgaa also is entitled to a return of all cash milestone payments to date  plus liquidated damages of  upon termination of the agreement  we would also be required to use our best reasonable efforts to cause the release of merck kgaa as guarantor of the credit facility for our new manufacturing facility 
through december   merck kgaa has paid us million in up front and milestone fees and has confirmed that we have achieved additional milestones with respect to which we are entitled to receive an additional million in payments 
the million received through december  has been recorded as fees potentially refundable from a corporate partner and revenue recognition of all or a portion of such amounts will commence upon merck kgaa s agreeing on the production concept for the new imc c manufacturing facility and our obtaining the necessary collateral license agreements 
in april  the parties agreed on the production concept for the manufacturing facility and are currently working toward securing merck kgaa s guaranty of our obligations under a million credit facility 
we are also in the process of negotiating the necessary collateral license agreements 
merck has also agreed to reimburse us for one half of the outside contract service costs incurred with respect to our phase iii clinical trial using c with radiation in head and neck cancer patients 
we have also granted merck kgaa a license to develop and market bec worldwide 
we have retained the right to co promote bec with merck kgaa within north america and it is intended that we will be the bulk manufacturer of bec for worldwide production 
in return  merck kgaa has made research support payments to us totaling million and is required to make milestone payments to us of up to million  of which million has been received through december  in addition  merck kgaa is required to make royalty payments to us on any sales of bec outside north america  with a portion of the milestone and research support payments received under the agreement being creditable against the amount of royalties due

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of any of us corporate debt  foreign corporate debt  us government debt  foreign government agency guaranteed debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in investment grade fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we invest in securities which have a range of maturity dates 
typically  those with a short term maturity are fixed rate  highly liquid  debt instruments and those with longer term maturities are debt instruments with periodic interest rate adjustments 
we also have certain foreign exchange currency risk 
see footnote of the financial statements 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  and thereafter total fair value fixed rate      average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate these holdings consist of us corporate and foreign corporate floating rate notes 
interest on the securities is adjusted at fixed dates using prevailing interest rates 
these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal
