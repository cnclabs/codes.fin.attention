net revenues the company s unit volume is driven by product offerings  number of direct sales personnel  recurring sales and  to some extent  pricing 
the company s increasing base of installed systems provides a growing source of recurring revenues from the sale of disposable tags and service revenues 
for fiscal  and  approximately   and respectively of the company s net revenues were attributable to sales of disposable tags and service to its installed base of customers 
the company s customers are substantially dependent on retail sales which are seasonal and subject to significant fluctuations which are difficult to predict 
the company s sales are impacted by such seasonality and fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
in  revenues increased by approximately million or from million to million 
this increase was attributable to i the revenue generated from the meto acquisition ii increased sales of the company s electronic article surveillance eas product line in europe and international retail markets iii an increase in revenue of the company s access control products offset by iv a decrease in the company s eas and cctv fire and burglary products in north america 
during  revenues increased by approximately million or from million to million 
this increase in revenues was due primarily to i increased sales of the company s eas product line in north america united states and canada  and to a lesser extent in the company s international retail markets excluding canada  and ii increased sales of the company s cctv fire and burglar products in both the north american and international markets 
north american net revenues accounted for   and in   and  respectively 
in  north american eas net revenues decreased by million or compared to an increase of million or in sales of the company s domestic cctv fire and burglary products decreased by million or in compared to an increase of million or in in  net revenues of the company s access control product line  primarily in the united states  increased million or when compared to  while in  net revenues remained consistent with the prior year 
international net revenues excluding canada accounted for   and in   and  respectively 
international net revenues  consisting primarily of eas and cctv fire and burglary  increased by million or and million or in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues during  cost of revenues increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased from to 
the increase in the company s cost of revenues is primarily attributable to i an increase in field service costs to support international chain wide installations  and ii an increase in product cost related to idle capacity 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in research development expenses 
during  cost of revenues increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased from to 
the increase in the company s cost of revenues is primarily attributable to i product mix  ie  higher growth rate on revenue of lower margin products such as cctv fire and burglar systems  partially offset by the growth rate in revenue from high margin disposable tags during  cctv fire and burglar revenue increased by while disposable label revenue increased by  ii the costs associated with excess capacity in the puerto rico manufacturing facilities resulting from the expansion  iii an increase in field service costs to support existing and future revenues  iv higher costs of disposable tags manufactured in japan  and v an increase in research and development activities associated with the development of rfid products 
the principal elements comprising cost of revenues are product cost  research and development cost  and field service and installation cost 
the components of product cost are as follows material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
the principal raw materials and components used by the company in the manufacture of its products are electronic components and circuit boards for its systems  and aluminum foil  resins  paper  and ferric chloride solutions for the company s disposable tags 
while most of these materials are purchased from several suppliers  there are numerous alternative sources for all such materials 
the company s general practice is to maintain a level of inventory sufficient to meet anticipated demand for its products 
as a result of the company s expansion of its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the acquisition of the assets of tokai electronics co  ltd 
 capacity is expected to exceed product demand 
this excess capacity negatively impacted product costs in and while improving  the company expects it to continue to negatively impact product costs in the year for fiscal year and  field service and installation costs were and of net revenues  respectively 
the company believes that it has and will continue to make product design changes that improve product performance and result in easier installation  thereby reducing these costs as a percentage of net revenues over time 
selling  general and administrative expenses during  sg a expenses increased million or from million to million 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses decreased by from to 
the higher expenses in dollars were due to a million increase in support costs finance  administration  legal  mis  and operations offset by a million decrease in variable costs selling  commissions  and royalties and sales support costs marketing and customer service

other income loss  net other income loss  net was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
other income loss  net of million in resulted from net foreign exchange losses 
other income loss  net of million in included million of proceeds from the final settlement of the insurance claim relating to the loss of business income caused by a fire at the company s warehouse facility in france offset by a net foreign exchange loss of million 
other income loss  net of million in includes i a payment of million from mitsubishi materials corporation in connection with the establishment of a joint product research and development project  ii an insurance claim of million relating to the loss of business income caused by a fire at the company s warehouse facility in france  and iii a net foreign exchange gain of million 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the majority of the interest expense is attributable to the million convertible subordinated debentures issued in october of interest income for fiscal year   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in was directly attributable to the increased cash investments as a result of the cash generated from operations beginning with and continuing throughout the decrease in was a result of a direct reduction in cash and cash investments primarily related to i cash used to purchase the company s common stock in and  ii cash used to support operations in  iii the costs related to the expansion of the company s manufacturing facility in ponce  puerto rico during the second half of  and iv the acquisition of the assets of tokai electronics co  in february income taxes the company s effective tax rate for fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the lower rate in was a result of proportionally higher tax exempt earnings in puerto rico  and the benefit of tax loss carryforwards which previously had been subject to a full valuation allowance 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will increase in as high taxed foreign earnings will represent a greater percentage of total earnings 
also  the non deductible amortization of goodwill  resulting from the meto acquisition  will have a negative impact on the effective tax rate in the future 
the company s net earnings generated by the operations of its puerto rico subsidiary are substantially exempt from federal income taxes under section of the internal revenue code section and are substantially exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
net earnings net earnings were million or 
per share  million or 
per share  and million or 
per share for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in the weighted average number of shares from to was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock throughout and financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs have related to  and are expected to continue to relate to  capital investments  acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the company has met its liquidity needs over the last three years primarily through funds provided by long term borrowings  through a secondary issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering  and more recently through cash generated from operations 
the company believes that cash provided from operating activities and funding available under its current credit agreements  should be adequate for its presently foreseeable working capital and capital investment requirements 
the company s operating activities during fiscal generated approximately million compared to approximately million during this change from the prior year was primarily the result of a decreased investment in working capital and long term customer contracts 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of meto ag 
in connection with the acquisition  the company entered into a new million six and one half year senior collateralized multi currency credit facility with a consortium of twenty one banks led by the company s principal lending bank 
the credit facility  which expires on march   includes a million equivalent multi currency term note and a million equivalent multi currency revolving line of credit 
interest on the new facility resets quarterly and is based on the eurocurrency base rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   million euro approximately million and million were outstanding under the term loan and billion japanese yen approximately million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the company s comprehensive tag program comp tag tm is a financial marketing sales program designed to remove capital investment costs as an obstacle to the potential customer s decision to purchase an eas system 
this program is offered to large potential customers in strategic vertical markets who are considering chainwide eas installations 
through the comp tag program  the company internally finances the leasing of equipment to retailers under long term non cancelable contracts  usually three to five years 
customers pay a premium price for an agreed upon minimum number of tags shipped on a quarterly or other periodic basis 
the comprehensive tag price reflects the cost of hardware  disposable rf labels  installation and interest 
comp tag agreements that meet all the necessary requirements for sales type leasing as defined under sfas no 
and are recognized as a sale upon shipment of the eas hardware 
if the terms and conditions specified in the comp tag agreement do not meet all the necessary requirements for sales type lease accounting  then the accounting requires operating lease treatment 
the cash flow impact is independent of the accounting used for the consolidated earnings statement 
in the majority of cases  the company is able to recover equipment and installation costs between months under the five year contract and within a shorter period of time for contracts which run three or four years 
the impact of the comp tag agreement is reflected on the statement of cash flows under two captions i long term customer contracts for those meeting sales type lease accounting  or ii revenue equipment placed under operating lease 
comp tag contracts under the sales type lease accounting method are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
comp tag contracts under the operating lease accounting method are included in revenue equipment on operating lease on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s management has determined that the risks of the comp tag program ie cash outlay  credit risk  equipment  and tag monitoring costs are far outweighed by the acceleration of chain wide installations  which drive market share and faster acceptance of source tagging by manufacturers 
this in turn  reduces the retailers costs of hand applying labels  thereby further increasing the favorable impact to the retailers bottom line 
the company has never paid a cash dividend except for a nominal cash distribution in april  to redeem the rights outstanding under the company s shareholders rights plan 
the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividend in the near future and is limited by existing covenants in the company s debt instruments with regard to paying dividends 
management believes that its anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future can be funded from cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability under the million  six and one half year revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures during fiscal totaled million compared to million during fiscal the higher expenditures during were a direct result of the costs associated with the completion of the plant expansion at the company s main manufacturing facility located in ponce  puerto rico 
the company anticipates its capital expenditures to approximate million in stock repurchase on october   the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock at an average cost not to exceed per share 
during  the board of directors approved the purchase of up to or approximately million shares of the company s common stock at an average cost not to exceed per share 
as of december   the company has purchased  shares of common stock for an average price of per share under the program  and  shares of common stock for an average price of per share under the program 
there were no stock repurchases in exposure to international operations the company exports products for international sales to its foreign subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries  in turn  sell these products to customers in their respective geographic area of operation  generally in local currencies 
this method of sale and resale gives rise to the risk of gains or losses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
furthermore  approximately of the company s disposable tags offered for sale are manufactured in japan 
as material and production costs are denominated in japanese yen  the related product costs are subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to reduce the company s exposure resulting from currency fluctuations  the company has been selectively purchasing currency exchange forward contracts on a regular basis 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows the company to shift the risk  whether positive or negative  of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party 
as of december   the company had currency exchange forward contracts totaling approximately  million 
the contracts are in the various local currencies covering primarily the company s western european operations along with the company s canadian and australian operations 
the company s operations in japan  argentina  mexico and brazil were not covered by currency exchange forward contracts at december  during  the company entered into a foreign exchange option contract for the conversion of million euros into usd with an expiration date of may the company will continue to evaluate the use of currency options in order to reduce the impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on the company s net earnings from sales made by the company s international operations 
the combination of forward exchange contracts and currency options should reduce the company s risks associated with significant exchange rate fluctuations 
other matters pending accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes a new model for the accounting and reporting of derivative and hedging transactions 
the statement amends a number of existing standards and  as amended by sfas no 
 is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company expects to adopt this standard as required in fiscal year and  because of continual business driven changes to its derivatives and hedging programs  has not fully assessed its potential impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial statements 
the company is currently assessing the impact  if any  that the sab will have on its revenue recognition policy 
the company currently recognizes revenue upon shipment of eas hardware 
the sab could require the company to recognize revenue upon installation of eas hardware 
any change resulting from the application of the accounting described in the sab will be reported as a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  in the first quarter of should the company determine that the aforementioned change in policy is required  the cumulative effect would range from million million 
year during  management initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year along with assessing supply chain and customer implications 
all of the company s centralized computer systems were inventoried and assessed to determine their year readiness  and remediation of all systems was completed in when the date change occurred  the company did not experience any computer related failures 
a significant proportion of the costs associated with the year effort represented the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
in addition  there were consulting and other expenses related to software application and hardware enhancements necessary to prepare the systems for the year the cost to test and remedy the company s information systems was approximately million 
this amount included the acceleration of hardware and software purchases of approximately million and outside consulting services of million 
market risk factors fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company enters into exchange forward contracts and purchases options denominated in foreign currency to hedge foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow 
see accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions and financial instruments and risk management in the summary of significant accounting policies  note  and financial instruments and risk management  note sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices  which are reasonably possible over a one year period  are described below 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices 
the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of fixed rate debt instruments 
these debt instruments have a net fair value of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates at december  would result in a million decrease in the net market value of the liability 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates at december   would result in a million increase in the net market value of the liability 
the company s million subordinated debentures are also subject to equity price risk 
the fair value of these debentures was a liability of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the year end closing price of the company s common stock  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening in the company s common stock would result in a net increase in the fair value liability of million  while a weakening in the company s common stock would result in a net decrease in the fair value liability of million 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk includes the company s million euro term loan and million multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   million euro approximately million and billion japanese yen approximately million were outstanding under this agreement 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million decrease in the liability of the term loan  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million increase in the liability of the term loan 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million decrease in the liability of the revolving credit facility  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million increase in the liability of the revolving credit facility 
also subject to foreign currency exchange risk is the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options which represent a net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies would result in an increase of million in the net asset position  while a weakening of the dollar versus all other currencies would result in a decrease of million 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts are used to hedge the company s firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
there are presently no significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the united states
