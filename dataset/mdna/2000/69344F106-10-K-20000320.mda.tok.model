item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some statements in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including those statements relating to revenues  gross margins  gross profit  research and development expenses marketing  general and administrative expenditures  and capital resources sufficiency 
our results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements for a number of reasons  including those described below in factors you should consider before investing in pmc sierra 
we may not  nor are we obliged to  release revisions to forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events 
we issued a two for one stock dividend on may  and another on february  share numbers and prices in this report have been adjusted to reflect these events 
general 
we design  develop  market and support high performance semiconductor solutions for advanced telecommunications and data communications networking markets 
our products are used in the broadband communications infrastructure and high bandwidth networks 
we supply atm  sonet sdh  t e  t e and ethernet semiconductors 
in january and march  we announced acquisitions of toucan technology limited  aanetcom inc and extreme packet devices extreme in exchange for approximately million shares of common stock and options to purchase common stock 
this includes an estimated million shares of common stock and options for the purchase extreme 
the exact number of shares will vary along with the market price of our common stock until the extreme transaction closes 
we expect to account for these transactions using the pooling of interests method 
in september  we acquired abrizio  inc  a fabless semiconductor company that specializes in broadband switch chip fabrics used in core atm switches  digital cross connects  and terabit routers 
we issued approximately  shares of common stock and stock options in exchange for all of the equity securities of abrizio 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of abrizio as though it had always been a part of pmc 
in the second quarter of  we expanded our portfolio of atm layer and switching products by acquiring integrated telecom technology inc igt 
igt was a fabless semiconductor company headquartered in gaithersburg  md 
igt also had a development site in san jose  ca 
igt made atm switching chipsets for wide area network applications as well as atm segmentation and reassembly and other telecommunication chips 
we paid million in total consideration to acquire igt 
we paid million cash to igt shareholders  million cash to igt creditors and issued approximately  shares of common stock and options to purchase common stock 
the purchase price also included  in professional fees and other direct acquisition costs see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the igt acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the amount allocated to in process research and development ipr d of million was expensed on the acquisition date 
our valuation employed the sec s guidelines regarding acceptable methodologies for valuing ipr d 
we considered the stage of completion of individual projects and the risk associated with the stage of completion of the technology 
during the third quarter of  we determined that a portion of the intangible assets recognized in connection with the igt acquisition was impaired as we had terminated development work on a project 
we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of million because we determined that the developed and core technology related to this project was not technologically feasible and had no alternative future use 
results of operations net revenues  change change networking products non networking other non networking modem total net revenues net revenues increased in as the growth in volume of sales of networking products exceeded the decline in revenues from non networking products 
networking revenues grew in and in our growth was driven by growth in our customers networking equipment business and our customers continued transition from designs based on custom semiconductors to designs based on standard semiconductors 
non networking other revenues  which include custom and other semiconductor revenues  declined from to and from to this reflects our strategic decision to restructure our other non networking business and to focus on networking semiconductor business 
we are supporting non networking products for existing customers  but have not developed any further products of this type since consistent with our restructuring  we exited the modem chipset business and sold all our modem chipset inventories in no future revenues are expected from that business 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit increased from to and from to as increased gross profit from higher sales volumes of networking products offset a decline in gross profit due to lower revenues and margins from non networking products 
networking gross profit in  as a percentage of revenues  was consistent with and lower wafer costs  higher wafer yields and new product production ramps offset reductions in average selling prices for sales of existing products 
the gross margins of these products were high relative to overall gross margins in the semiconductor industry because our chips are highly complex and are sold in relatively low volumes 
in  each of our networking products accounted for less than of total networking revenue 
we believe that  as the market for our networking products grows and customers purchase in greater volumes  gross profit as a percentage of revenues will decline 
non networking gross profit decreased by from to and from to our non networking gross profit continues to decline because of the lack of new products 
other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of goodwill percentage of net revenues costs of merger percentage of net revenues in process research development percentage of net revenues impairment of intangible assets percentage of net revenues restructuring and other costs percentage of net revenues research and development and marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our research and development r d expenses increased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in and in r d expenditures increased in and because we hired more employees  expanded r d subcontracting and acquired abrizio inc and igt 
substantially all r d activity carried out in  and related to networking products 
we incur r d expenditures in order to attain technological leadership from a multi year perspective 
this has caused r d spending to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we expect such fluctuations  particularly when measured as a percentage of net revenues  to occur in the future  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net revenues 
in the future  we expect r d expenses to increase and relate entirely to networking products 
from to and from to  we increased total marketing  general and administrative expenses by and respectively 
from to  these expenses as a percentage of total net revenues declined because many marketing  general and administrative expenses are fixed in the short term 
therefore  during periods of rising revenues  these expenses decline as a percentage of revenues 
we expect marketing  general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars during amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization increased from to and from to as we amortized the goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of igt 
our strategic plan anticipates acquiring companies or assets in the purchase method of accounting may be used to account for these acquisitions 
this could result in significant goodwill amortization charges in future period which could materially impact our operating results 
costs of merger 
we incurred approximately  in merger costs related to the acquisition of abrizio 
we expect to incur significant merger costs related to future acquisitions 
in process research and development ipr d 
no ipr d charges were incurred in our operating earnings could be materially impacted from significant ipr d charges if we acquire companies or assets in and use the purchase method of accounting 
in  we recorded ipr d expenses of million 
these charges include million related to the acquisition of igt and million related to the acquisition of technology which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in our allocation of the igt acquisition purchase price to ipr d  we considered the following for each in process project at the time of the acquisition the present value of forecasted cash flows and income that were expected to result from the projects  the status of projects  completion costs  project risks  the value of core technology  and the stage of completion of the individual project 
in valuing the core technology  we ensured that the relative allocations to core technology and ipr d were consistent with the relative contributions of each 
in the determination of the value of ipr d  we ensured that the value of ipr d only considered efforts completed as of the date igt was acquired 
the amount allocated to ipr d of million was expensed upon acquisition  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and successful development was uncertain 
as of the acquisition date  igt had three development projects in process 
in order to develop these projects into commercially viable products  we had to complete all planning  designing and testing activities necessary to establish that the products could be produced to meet their design requirements 
the calculations of value assigned to the ipr d reflected the efforts of igt prior to the close of the acquisition 
the estimated completion percentage  estimated technology life and projected introduction date of the three development projects as of the acquisition date were as follows percent technology introduction project completed life date project a years project b years project c years project a related to the development of an atm switching system 
projects b and c related to the segmentation and reassembly sar of data in an atm network 
we completed project a in the first quarter of and were in full production by the end of the year 
we completed development of project b in the fourth quarter of and were in full production in the first quarter of this was consistent with our initial estimates used in the valuation of the projects 
we terminated development on project c during the third quarter of see impairment of intangible assets 
research and development efforts related to project a and b are substantially complete and actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
products related to project a and b from the igt acquisition have been introduced to the market in the last nine to twelve months 
shipment volumes of products from acquired technologies are not material to our overall position at the present time 
therefore  it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology or product life cycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
impairment of intangible assets 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned a development project 
we determined that a portion of the intangible assets recognized in connection with the igt acquisition was impaired 
the terminated project related to ongoing development of a segmentation and reassembly chip used to convert data packets to atm data cells refer to project c in in process research and development above 
the few customers who were using a predecessor chip were notified of the termination of all future development of this technology 
the technology was specialized and has no alternative future use 
interest and other income  net  change change interest and other income  net percentage of net revenues interest and other income  net 
higher cash balances available to earn interest caused interest income to increase in  and in addition  in we included approximately  of income which came as a result of an equity interest in another company 
interest expense decreased in and due to lower capital leases 
this reduction was partially offset by additional interest expense from debt assumed from abrizio and leases assumed from igt 
provision for income taxes 
our and income tax provision primarily reflects the provision for income taxes for our canadian subsidiary 
our us taxes for and were largely eliminated by tax losses realized from our restructuring charge 
the million charge for ipr d and the related million impairment of intangible assets taken in are non deductible and will not result in any future tax benefits 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we expect to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the recognition of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we anticipate that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant effect on our operating results or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of during  operating activities provided million in cash 
the net income of million in includes non cash charges of million for depreciation  million for amortization and a non cash credit of million for gains from the sale of certain investments 
during  we spent million on investments and million on new plant and equipment 
we also used cash to increase short term investments by million and to reduce our debt and capital lease obligations by million 
we received million in a wafer fabrication deposit refund  million from our sale of an investment and million by issuing common stock  principally under our stock option and purchase plans 
our principal source of liquidity at december  was our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we also have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million provided  along with other restrictions  that we do not pay cash dividends or make any material divestments without the bank s written consent 
we have supply agreements with two independent foundries that supply substantially all of the wafers for our products 
we have made deposits to secure access to wafer fabrication capacity under both of these agreements 
at december  and  we had and million  respectively  in deposits with the foundries 
under these agreements  the foundries must supply certain quantities of wafers per year 
neither of these agreements have minimum unit volume requirements but we are obliged under one of the agreements to purchase a minimum percentage of our total annual wafer requirements provided that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive technology  pricing  quality and delivery 
the agreements may be terminated if either party does not comply with the terms 
we expect to spend million in additional deposits to secure foundry capacity in and to receive a refund of million of existing deposits 
we purchased million in goods from our foundry suppliers during compared to million in those amounts may not be indicative of any future period since wafer prices and our volume requirements may change 
in each year  we are entitled to receive a refund of a portion of these deposits 
the amount to be received is based on the annual purchases from those foundries compared to the target levels in the agreements 
based on purchases  we received a million refund from one of the foundries in the first quarter of if we do not receive our deposits back during the term of the agreements  then they will be returned to us at the end of the term 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of we expect to purchase or arrange capital leases for approximately million of new capital expenditures during in  actual capital expenditures totaled million 
factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless networking semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in pmc 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
if one or more of our customers changes their ordering pattern or if we lose one or more of our customers  our revenues could decline we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  lucent technologies and cisco systems each accounted for more than of our fiscal revenues 
we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  decide to use competing products  are acquired or divested  market different products  change production schedules or change their orders for other reasons 
if one or more customers were to delay  reduce or cancel orders  our overall order levels may fluctuate greatly  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
if our customers use our competitors products instead of ours  suffer a decline in demand for their products or are acquired or sold  our revenues may decline our expenses are relatively fixed so that fluctuation in our revenues may cause our operating results to fluctuate as well 
demand for our products and  as a result our revenues  may decline for the following reasons outside our control 
as our customers increase the frequency by which they design next generation systems and select the chips for those new systems  our competitors have an increased opportunity to convince our customers to switch to their products  which may cause our revenues to decline the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological advancement in design tools  wafer manufacturing techniques  process tools and alternate networking technologies 
we must identify and capture future market opportunities to offset the rapid price erosion that characterizes our industry 
we may not be able to develop new products at competitive pricing and performance levels 
even if we are able to do so  we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner 
our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation equipment with those of current or future competitors 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because of shortened product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products 
major domestic and international semiconductor companies  such as intel  ibm  and lucent technologies  are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantially greater financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate 
this represents a serious competitive threat to pmc 
emerging companies also provide significant competition in our segment of the semiconductor market 
our competitors include applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom  conexant systems  cypress semiconductor  dallas semiconductor  galileo technology  integrated device technology  ibm  infineon  intel  lucent technologies  motorola  mmc networks  texas instruments  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which also may have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
in addition  we are aware of venture backed companies that focus on specific portions of our broad range of products 
competition is particularly strong in the market for optical networking and optical telecommunication chips  in part due to the market s growth rate  which attracts larger competitors  and in part due to the number of smaller companies focused on this area 
these companies  individually or collectively  could represent future competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
we must often redesign our products to meet rapidly evolving industry standards and customer specifications  which may delay an increase in our revenues we sell products to a market whose characteristics include rapidly evolving industry standards  product obsolescence  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on high speed networking technologies that have not been widely adopted or ratified by one of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers often delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays 
if demand for our customers products changes  including due to a downturn in the networking industry  our revenues could decline our customers routinely build inventories of our products in anticipation of end demand for their products 
many of our customers have numerous product lines  numerous component requirements for each product  and sizeable and very complex supplier structures 
this makes forecasting their production requirements difficult and can lead to an inventory surplus of certain of their suppliers components 
in the past  some of our customers have built pmc component inventories that exceeded their production requirements 
those customers materially reduced their orders and impacted our operating results 
this may happen again 
in addition  while all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  our customers products are sold worldwide 
any major fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially affect our customers end demand  and force them to reduce orders  which could cause our revenues to decline 
since we develop products many years before their volume production  if we inaccurately anticipate our customers needs  our revenues may not increase our products generally take between and months from initial conceptualization to development of a viable prototype  and another to months to be designed into our customers equipment and into production 
they often need to be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards 
as a result  we develop products many years before volume production and may inaccurately anticipate our customers needs 
there have been times when we either designed products that had more features than were demanded when they were introduced to the market or conceptualized products that were not sufficiently feature rich to meet the needs of our customers or compete effectively against our competitors 
this may happen again 
if the recent trend of consolidation in the networking industry continues  our customers may be acquired or sold  which could cause those customers to cancel product lines or development projects and our revenues to decline the networking equipment industry has experienced significant merger activity and partnership programs 
through mergers or partnerships  our customers could seek to remove redundancies in their product lines or development initiatives 
this could lead to the cancellation of a product line into which pmc products are designed or a development project on which pmc is participating 
in the cases of a product line cancellation  pmc revenues could be materially impacted 
in the case of a development project cancellation  we may be forced to cancel development of one or more products  which could mean opportunities for future revenues from this development initiative could be lost 
if there is not sufficient market acceptance of the recently developed specifications and protocols on which our new products are based  we may not be able to sustain or increase our revenues we recently introduced a number of ethernet switch products which function at gigabit and fast ethernet speeds 
gigabit ethernet involves the transmission of data over ethernet protocol networks at speeds of up to one billion bits per second 
fast ethernet transmits data over these networks at speeds of up to megabits per second 
while gigabit and fast ethernet are well established  it is not clear whether products meeting these protocols will be competitive with products meeting alternative protocols  or whether our products will be sufficiently attractive to achieve commercial success 
some of our other recently introduced products adhere to specifications developed by industry groups for transmissions of data signals  or packets  over high speed fiber optics transmission standards 
these transmission standards are called synchronous optical network  or sonet  in north america  and synchronous data hierarchy  or sdh in europe 
the specifications  commonly called packet over sonet sdh  may be rejected for other technologies  such as mapping ip directly onto fiber 
in addition  we can not be sure whether our products will compete effectively with packet over sonet sdh offerings of other companies 
a substantial portion of our business also relies on industry acceptance of asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  products 
atm is a networking protocol 
while atm has been an industry standard for a number of years  the overall atm market has not developed as rapidly as some observers had predicted it would 
as a result  competing communications technologies  including gigabit and fast ethernet and packet over sonet sdh  may inhibit the future growth of atm and our sales of atm products 
our business strategy contemplates acquisition of other companies or technologies  which could adversely affect our operating performance we recently acquired or have announced acquisitions of four companies  three of which have design wins for their products 
the design wins have not yet generated significant revenue 
these or any follow on products may not achieve commercial success 
these acquisition may not generate future revenues or earnings 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is an integral part of our business strategy 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
we have not previously attempted to integrate several acquisitions simultaneously and may not succeed in this effort 
a future acquisition could adversely affect operating results 
in particular  if we were to acquire a company or assets and record the acquisition as a purchase  we may capitalize a significant goodwill asset 
this asset would be amortized over its expected period of benefit 
the resulting amortization expense could seriously impact operating results for many years 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have an equal or a senior interest 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
we anticipate lower margins on mature and high volume products  which could adversely affect our profitability we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in average selling prices  or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher average selling prices 
yield or other production problems  or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current operating costs 
we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products if we do not accurately predict demand or if we fail to secure adequate wafer fabrication or assembly capacity anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment 
if our customers were to delay  cancel or otherwise change future ordering patterns  we could be left with unwanted inventory 
recently  our suppliers  particularly silicon wafer suppliers  have experienced an increase in the demand for their products or services 
if our silicon wafer or other suppliers are unable or unwilling to increase productive capacity in line with the growth in demand  we may suffer longer production lead times 
longer production lead times require that we forecast the demand for our products further into the future 
thus  a greater proportion of our manufacturing orders will be based on forecasts  rather than actual customers orders 
this increases the likelihood of forecasting errors 
these forecasting errors could lead to excess inventory in certain products and insufficient inventory in others  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to increase productive capacity in line with demand  we may suffer supply shortages or be allocated supply 
a shortage in supply could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customer demand  which could adversely affect our customer relationships along with our current and future operating results 
we rely on a limited source of wafer fabrication  the loss of which could delay and limit our product shipments we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
two outside foundries supply most of our semiconductor device requirements 
our foundry suppliers also produce products for themselves and other companies 
in addition  we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
some companies which supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which we are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which we are designed 
we depend on third parties in asia for assembly of our semiconductor products which could delay and limit our product shipments sub assemblers in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays which  in turn  may result in the loss of customers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
we depend on a limited number of design software suppliers  the loss of which could impede our product development a limited number of suppliers provide the computer aided design  or cad  software we use to design our products 
factors affecting the price  availability or technical capability of these products could affect our ability to access appropriate cad tools for the development of highly complex products 
in particular  the cad software industry has been the subject of extensive intellectual property rights litigation  the results of which could materially change the pricing and nature of the software we use 
we also have limited control over whether our software suppliers will be able to overcome technical barriers in time to fulfill our needs 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than companies which operate their businesses mostly in the united states  which may impair our sales  development or manufacturing of our products we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than most companies because  in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing are conducted outside of the united states 
this subjects us to the following risks 
we may lose our ability to design or produce products  could face additional unforeseen costs or could lose access to key customers if any of the nations in which we conduct business impose trade barriers or new communications standards we may have difficulty obtaining export licenses for certain technology produced for us outside the united states 
if a foreign country imposes new taxes  tariffs  quotas  and other trade barriers and restrictions or the united states and a foreign country develop hostilities or change diplomatic and trade relationships  we may not be able to continue manufacturing or sub assembly of our products in that country and may have fewer sales in that country 
we may also have fewer sales in a country that imposes new communications standards or technologies 
this could inhibit our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and lower our revenues 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because a significant part of our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are denominated in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are denominated in a variety of currencies around the world 
in addition  a number of the countries in which we have sales offices have a history of imposing exchange rate controls 
this could make it difficult to withdraw the foreign currency denominated assets we hold in these countries 
we may have difficulty collecting receivables from customers based in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our earnings we sell our products to customers around the world 
payment cycle norms in these countries may not be consistent with our standard payment terms 
thus  we may have greater difficulty collecting receivables on time from customers in these countries 
this could impact our financial performance  particularly on our balance sheet 
in addition  we may be faced with greater difficulty in collecting outstanding balances due to the shear distances between our collection facilities and our customers  and we may be unable to enforce receivable collection in foreign nations due to their business legal systems 
if one or more of our foreign customers do not pay their outstanding receivable  we may be forced to write off the account 
this could have a material impact on our earnings 
the loss of personnel could preclude us from designing new products to succeed  we must retain and hire technical personnel highly skilled at the design and test functions used to develop high speed networking products and related software 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we  along with our peers  customers and other companies in the communications industry  are facing intense competition for those employees from our peers and an increasing number of startup companies which are emerging with potentially lucrative employee ownership arrangements 
we do not have employment agreements in place with our key personnel 
we issue common stock options that are subject to vesting as employee incentives 
these options  however  are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from copying our technology and selling similar products  which would harm our revenues to compete effectively  we must protect our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold several patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation and prevent us from selling our products vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
we  as well as our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
this has happened in the past 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  nor might we be able to find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents compared to our larger competitors  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our larger competitors and customers 
in the past  our customers have been required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
until december of  we indemnified our customers up to the dollar amount of their purchases of our products found to be infringing on technology owned by third parties 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms we or you will find favorable 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as our or our competitors announce new products  our and our peers or customers results fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change or investors change their sentiment toward technology stocks 
in addition  increases in our stock price and expansion of our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through our operations in canada and elsewhere 
in our effort to hedge this risk  we typically forecast our operational currency needs  purchase such currency on the open market at the beginning of an operational period  and hold these funds as a hedge against currency fluctuations 
we usually limit the operational period to months or less 
while we expect to utilize this method of hedging our foreign currency risk in the future  we may change our hedging methodology and utilize foreign exchange contracts that are currently available under our operating line of credit agreement
