the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
in particular  we have included forward looking statements regarding the following i our strategy  ii the anticipated timing of our regulatory filings  iii other product development efforts that we intend to undertake  iv the growth of our product sales and markets  v the results of our litigation with novartis  and vi our future revenue and expenses 
sangstat  the transplant company  is a global bio pharmaceutical company applying a disease management approach to improving the outcome of organ  bone marrow  and stem cell transplantation 
since  we have built a family of products and services to address the pre transplant  acute care and chronic phases of transplant in the worldwide market 
our business is currently organized into two segments transplantation products and transplantation services 
the transplantation products segment consists of six marketed products  two principal product candidates and additional product candidates in various stages of research and development 
we plan to capitalize on our products and product pipeline by developing relationships with key providers and managed care organizations to better integrate the management of transplant recipients care to improve the outcomes and lower the costs of transplants 
during  we launched two products  thymoglobulin and celsior  in the united states  launched sangcya oral solution in the united kingdom  and prepared for the launch of a cyclosporine capsule product 
we also signed a major co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories  completed the integration of imtix sangstat  and further developed the transplant pharmacy 
the company s accumulated deficit from inception through december  was  our operating loss has been substantial each year since inception and losses are expected to continue in the foreseeable future as a result of a number of factors  including the uncertainty in the timing and the amount of revenue to be earned upon product sales  and expenses required for product development  clinical trials and marketing and sales activities 
in addition  our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the success of our research and development efforts  litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  in particular  litigation with novartis regarding sangcya oral solution  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process  reliance on third parties to manufacture products or product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with health care reform measures 
even if our products appear promising at various stages of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the product candidates will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to market  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties or be unacceptable to providers  payers or patients 
additional expenses  delays and losses of opportunities that may arise out of these and other risks could harm our business and results of operations 
acquisition of imtix on september   we completed the acquisition of pasteur m rieux connaught s aventis organ transplant business known as imtix 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the resulting wholly owned subsidiary  named imtix sangstat imtix  is dedicated to the research  development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals for transplantation 
the aggregate gross purchase price of approximately million consisted of million paid upon closing and a non interest bearing note of million payable over five years see liquidity and capital resources 
the resulting aggregate net purchase price totaled million and was allocated to the net tangible assets acquired of million  based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  identifiable intangible assets of million and purchased in process research and development of million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to existing technology  and is being amortized over a period of fourteen years 
the purchased in process research and development of approximately million was charged to our operations in the third quarter of and represents the value of products that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the purchased in process technology acquired primarily consisted of a single drug  anti lfa anti lfa is a monoclonal  biologically manufactured immunosuppressant compound intended to be used in preventing the rejection of organ transplants 
the estimated value for the in process technology was determined using the income approach which discounted to present value the cash flows expected to be derived from the product as it was still in development at the date of acquisition 
the projections were based on future expectations of the acquired company s revenue and expenses to be generated from the product still under development 
revenues and operating profit attributable to the in process technology were estimated to total million and million  respectively  over a fourteen year projection period 
the resulting projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value of million using a discount rate of  adjusted on a prorata basis for negative goodwill 
the discount rate used was calculated based on the weighted average cost of capital and adjusted for the technology risk associated with development of the in process product 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product principally related to the completion of clinical trials to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population 
upon successful completion of the trials  fda approval would be required before marketing the product for a specified use

we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses relating to the novartis lawsuits for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or over expenses of  the increase was principally due to the expansion of our commercial infrastructure and launch and pre launch activities to help support the us launches of our first two therapeutic products  sangcya oral solution and thymoglobulin  the growth of the transplant pharmacy and the addition of imtix expenses in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of imtix  the company recorded a charge of  for purchased in process research and development in this charge was primarily associated with the ongoing development of anti lfa during  following our evaluation of the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies  we decided to discontinue the development of anti lfa amortization of intangible assets

liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we financed our operations substantially from proceeds of approximately  from public offerings of our common stock   from private placements of equity securities and  from convertible debt and the note payable to abbott laboratories 
during the years ended december   and  our net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was due to the amount of net loss incurred  as well as an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of  in milestone payments from abbott laboratories in connection with the co promotion agreement between abbott and sangstat 
in fiscal years and  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the amount of net loss incurred in each of those years 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and total assets of  net cash provided by investing activities totaled  and  during the years ended december  and respectively 
for the year ended december  we reported a net use of cash in investing activities of  in fiscal cash was provided by maturities of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and short term investments 
in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was primarily from the maturity of short term investments  partially offset by the use of cash for the purchase of imtix 
in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  during the years ended december   and respectively 
in fiscal  cash was provided by the issuance of notes payable and the sale of common stock which are described in more detail in the following two paragraphs 
in both fiscal years and  net cash was provided primarily by the sale of common stock  partially offset by repayments of notes and capital lease obligations 
in march  we issued a million convertible note due march  this note bears interest at the rate of through march  and thereafter at the rate of on any overdue amount 
the interest is payable semi annually in september and march 
the note  or any portion thereof  is convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or after march  and before march  into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each  principal amount 
we received net proceeds of  in may  the company and abbott laboratories abbott signed a multi year co promotion  distribution and research agreement for sangcya oral solution and cyclosporine capsules in the united states 
pursuant to this agreement  abbott made an equity investment of million in exchange for approximately  shares of common stock 
in addition  abbott made a series of up front and milestone payments totaling million through december   and a long term loan of million to the company 
in january  we made a milestone payment to abbott of million under the terms of the agreement and received another milestone payment of million 
all up front and milestone payments received  net of milestone payments made  and the premium received on the sale of the common stock to abbott are recorded as deferred revenue and are being recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we may also receive an additional million in milestone payments  contingent upon receiving regulatory approval for the cyclosporine capsule 
in connection with the equity investment  abbott and sangstat entered into a right of first refusal agreement and a registration rights agreement  and amended and restated their existing supply agreement 
the loan bears interest at  payable annually  and is secured by a security interest in the united states marketing rights for sangcya oral solution 
the loan matures on december   and can be prepaid by us without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
notes payable at december   includes  representing the current accreted value of the non interest bearing note issued in connection with the acquisition of imtix 
the note was discounted at a rate of and is payable as follows million in  million in  million in  and million in in february  we completed a private placement of approximately  shares of common stock with an institutional investor 
the stock was issued at  the closing price of the stock on february   for aggregate proceeds of  we intend to use the proceeds to provide additional working capital to fund our anticipated future growth 
in fiscal we purchased  of new property and equipment 
this consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters in fremont  california and expenditures associated with the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning erp system 
we anticipate spending a similar amount on property and equipment in fiscal as we complete the erp system and continue to upgrade our manufacturing and computer equipment 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
in addition  we had available research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state tax purposes 
our ability to realize the benefits of the nol and credit carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the respective taxing jurisdiction prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to avail ourselves of such benefits 
furthermore  utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
we believe that we have sufficient funds to finance our current operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through additional financings  including private or public equity and or debt offerings and collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners in order to pursue new business opportunities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and the costs of manufacturing scale up and working capital requirements for inventory and financing of accounts receivable 
euro currency the single european currency euro was introduced on january  with complete transition to this new currency required by january we are currently assessing the issues raised by the introduction of the euro 
we have made and expect to continue to make changes to our internal systems in preparation for the transition to the euro 
we further expect that use of the euro may affect our foreign exchange activities and may result in increased fluctuations in foreign currency results 
any delays in our ability to be euro compliant could harm our results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas will be effective for our year ending december  we believe that this statement will not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity security prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than two years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount  which is consistent with the estimated effects at december  we generally have the ability to hold fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
substantially all of our long term obligations bear interest at fixed rates which are not subject to future increases in interest rates 
the fair value of these long term obligations  including current portion  at december  was million compared to book value of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corresponding fair value at december  was million compared to book value of million 
we therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
if our notes payable and convertible debt were subject to rate fluctuation  a hypothetical interest rate increase of would add approximately  to our interest expense for and  for equity price risk 
following the sale of our portfolio of corporate equity securities in december and january for a net gain of  we no longer hold any such securities 
foreign currency risk 
many of our foreign sales are invoiced in local currencies  creating receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the risk due to foreign currency fluctuations associated with these receivables is partially reduced by local payables denominated in the same currencies  and presently we do not consider it necessary to hedge these exposures 
we intend to re assess our hedging policy from time to time as our foreign operations change 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december  and actual results may differ materially
