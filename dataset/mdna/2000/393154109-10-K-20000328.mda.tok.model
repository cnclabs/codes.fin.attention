item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating revenues and mwh sales 
our wholesale rate on sales to two wholesale customers is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
revenues from sales to these customers were less than of operating revenues for late in  we began serving a municipal utility  northfield electric department  under our wholesale tariff 
this customer increased our electricity sales in by approximately  mwh and peak requirements by approximately mw 
revenues in from northfield were  the contract to purchase and provide energy  and maintain related production assets  ended in september we provide transmission service to twelve customers within the state under rates regulated by the ferc  revenues for such services amounted to less than of the company s operating revenues for on april   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued orders and which  among other things  required the filing of open access transmission tariffs by electric utilities  and the functional separation by utilities of their transmission operations from power marketing operations 
order also supports the full recovery of legitimate and verifiable wholesale power costs previously incurred under federal or state regulation 
on july   the ferc approved our open access transmission tariff  and on august  we filed our compliance refund report 
in accordance with order  we have also functionally separated our transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for our transmission operations 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to the ferc orders mentioned above 
the open access tariff could reduce the amount of capacity available to the company from such facilities in the future

the relicensing application for waterbury was filed in august the company expects the project to be relicensed for a year term in the near future and does not have any competition for the licenses 
department of public service twenty year electric plan 
in december  the department adopted an update of its twenty year electrical power supply plan the plan for the state 
the plan includes an overview of statewide growth and development as they relate to future requirements for electrical energy  an assessment of available energy resources  and estimates of future electrical energy demand 
in june  we filed with the vpsb and the department an integrated resource plan pursuant to vermont statute vsa c 
that filing is still pending before the vpsb 
recent rate developments on may   we filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent 
the retail rate increase was needed to cover higher power supply costs  the cost of the january ice storm  higher taxes and investments in new plant and equipment 
on november   by memorandum of understanding mou  the company  the department and ibm agreed to implement a temporary rate increase of percent  effective december   with the potential for an additional surcharge in order to produce additional revenues necessary to provide the company with the capacity to finance estimated pine street barge canal site expenditures of million  and to stay  effective november   further rate proceedings in this rate case until or after september   or such earlier date to which the parties may later agree or the vpsb may order 
on september and december   vpsb issued orders approving two amendments to the mou that the company had entered into with the vermont department of public service the department or dps and ibm 
the two amendments continued the stay of proceedings until september   with a final decision expected by december  the amendments maintained the other features of the original mou  and the second amendment provides for a temporary rate increase of percent  in addition to the current temporary rate level  to become effective as of january  the temporary rates are still subject to refund in the final rate case decision  if the final rates set are lower than the temporary rates 
one party to the rate case  the american association of retired persons  aarp  has filed an appeal to the vermont supreme court of the vpsb s order of december   arguing that the vpsb should have ordered the company to post a bond or escrow for the temporary rate increase 
the company has moved to dismiss the appeal

competition and restructuring electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
legislative authority has existed since that would permit vermont cities  towns and villages to own and operate public utilities 
since that time  no municipality served by the company has established or  as far as is known to the company  is presently taking steps to establish a municipal public utility 
in  the vermont general assembly enacted legislation that authorized the department to sell electricity on a significantly expanded basis 
before the new law was passed  the department s authority to make retail sales had been limited 
it could sell at retail only to residential and farm customers and could sell only power that it had purchased from the niagara and st 
lawrence projects operated by the new york power authority 
under the law  the department can sell electricity purchased from any source at retail to all customer classes throughout the state  but only if it convinces the vpsb and other state officials that the public good will be served by such sales 
the department has made limited additional retail sales of electricity 
the department retains its traditional responsibilities of public advocacy before the vpsb and electricity planning on a statewide basis 
in certain states across the country  including the new england states  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales

  vermont yankee 
on october   the owners of vermont yankee nuclear power corporation accepted a bid from amergen energy company for the vermont yankee generating plant 
the asset sale will require numerous regulatory approvals  including the federal energy regulatory commission  the nuclear regulatory commission  the securities and exchange commission and the vpsb 
assuming a final closing date for the transaction of july   amergen will pay vermont yankee approximately million for the plant and property 
as a condition of the sale  vermont yankee s current owners will make a one time and final payment of million to pre pay the plant s decommissioning fund 
in return  amergen will assume full responsibility for all future operating costs and the obligation to decommission the plant at the end of its life 
the company has agreed to buy power from the plant for periods that may extend up to twelve years 
the company and the other current owners are also responsible to vermont yankee for their share of the unrecovered plant and other costs resulting from the sale 
the company and central vermont public service corporation acted as lead sponsors in the construction of the vermont yankee nuclear plant  a boiling water reactor designed by general electric company 
the plant  which became operational in  has a generating capacity of mw 
vermont yankee has entered into power contracts with its sponsor utilities  including the company  that expire at the end of the life of the unit 
pursuant to our power contract  we are required to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses including depreciation and taxes  fuel costs including charges in respect of estimated costs of disposal of spent nuclear fuel  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity  whether or not the vermont yankee plant is operating 
in  we sold to other vermont utilities a share of our entitlement to the output of vermont yankee 
accordingly  those utilities have an obligation to pay us of vermont yankee s operating expenses  fuel costs  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity  whether or not the vermont yankee plant is operating 
vermont yankee has also entered into capital funds agreements with its sponsor utilities that expire on december  under its capital funds agreement  we are required  subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  to provide of the capital requirements of vermont yankee not obtained from outside sources 
in december  august and july  decisions were made to retire three new england nuclear units  connecticut yankee  maine yankee and millstone effective immediately  with several years remaining on each license 
the nrc s most recently issued systematic assessment of licensee performance scores for vermont yankee are for the period january  to july  operations  engineering  maintenance and plant support were rated good 
these scores were identical to vermont yankee s scores for the prior month period except for plant support  which declined from superior 
during periods when vermont yankee power is unavailable  we incur replacement power costs in excess of those costs that we would have incurred for power purchased from vermont yankee 
replacement power is available to us from the iso and through contractual arrangements with other utilities 
replacement power costs adversely affect cash flow and  absent deferral  amortization and recovery through rates  would adversely affect reported earnings 
routinely  in the case of scheduled outages for refueling  the vpsb has permitted the company to defer  amortize and recover these excess replacement power costs for financial reporting and rate making purposes over the period until the next scheduled outage 
vermont yankee has adopted an month refueling schedule 
the refueling outage is tentatively scheduled to begin june  though it may occur earlier 
in the case of unscheduled outages of significant duration resulting in substantial unanticipated costs for replacement power  the vpsb generally has authorized deferral  amortization and recovery of such costs 
vermont yankee s current estimate of costs to decommission the plant  as approved by ferc  is approximately million  of which million has been funded 
at december   our portion of the net non funded liability was million  which we expect will be recovered through rates over vermont yankee s remaining operating life 
vermont yankee s current operating license expires march during the year ended december   we used  mwh of vermont yankee energy to meet of our retail and requirements wholesale rate w sales 
the average cost of vermont yankee electricity in was per kwh 
vermont yankee s annual capacity factor for was  compared to in and in the capacity factor was the best ever for vermont yankee in a year that included a refueling outage 
see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  annual report to stockholders  hydro quebec highgate interconnection 
on september   the highgate transmission facilities  which were constructed to import energy from hydro quebec in canada  began commercial operation 
the transmission facilities at highgate include a mw ac to dc to ac converter terminal and seven miles of kv transmission line 
velco built and operates the converter facilities  which we own jointly with a number of other vermont utilities 
nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
velco and certain other nepool members have entered into agreements with hydro quebec which provided for the construction in two phases of a direct interconnection between the electric systems in new england and the electric system of hydro quebec in canada 
the vermont participants in this project  which has a capacity of  mw  will derive about of the total power supply benefits associated with the nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
the company  in turn  receives about one third of the vermont share of those benefits 
the benefits of the interconnection include access to surplus hydroelectric energy from hydro quebec at competitive prices  energy banking  under which participating new england utilities will transmit relatively inexpensive energy to hydro quebec during off peak periods and will receive equal amounts of energy  after adjustment for transmission losses  from hydro quebec during peak periods when replacement costs are higher  and a provision for emergency transfers and mutual backup to improve reliability for both the hydro quebec system and the new england systems 
phase i 
the first phase phase i of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection consists of transmission facilities having a capacity of mw that traverse a portion of eastern vermont and extend to a converter terminal located in comerford  new hampshire 
these facilities entered commercial operation on october  vetco was organized to construct  own and operate those portions of the transmission facilities located in vermont 
total construction costs incurred by vetco for phase i were  of that amount  velco provided  of equity capital to vetco through sales of velco preferred stock to the vermont participants in the project 
the company purchased  of velco preferred stock to finance the equity portion of phase i 
the remaining  of construction cost was financed by vetco s issuance of  of long term debt in the fourth quarter of and the balance of  was financed by short term debt 
under the phase i contracts  each new england participant  including the company  is required to pay monthly its proportionate share of vetco s total cost of service  including its capital costs 
each participant also pays a proportionate share of the total costs of service associated with those portions of the transmission facilities constructed in new hampshire by a subsidiary of new england electric system 
phase ii 
agreements executed in among the company  velco and other nepool members and hydro quebec provided for the construction of the second phase phase ii of the interconnection between the new england electric system and that of hydro quebec 
phase ii expanded the phase i facilities from mw to  mw  and provides for transmission of hydro quebec power from the phase i terminal in northern new hampshire to sandy pond  massachusetts 
construction of phase ii commenced in and was completed in late the phase ii facilities commenced commercial operation november   initially at a rating of  mw  and increased to a transfer capability of  mw in july the hydro quebec nepool firm energy contract provides for the import of economical hydro quebec energy into new england 
the company is entitled to of the phase ii power supply benefits 
total construction costs for phase ii were approximately  the new england participants  including the company  have contracted to pay monthly their proportionate share of the total cost of constructing  owning and operating the phase ii facilities  including capital costs 
as a supporting participant  the company must make support payments under year agreements 
these support agreements meet the capital lease accounting requirements under sfas at december   the present value of the company s obligation was approximately  the company s projected future minimum payments under the phase ii support agreements are approximately  for each of the years and an aggregate of  for the years the phase ii portion of the project is owned by new england hydro transmission electric company  inc 
and new england hydro transmission corporation  subsidiaries of new england electric system  in which certain of the phase ii participating utilities  including the company  own equity interests 
the company owns approximately of the equity of the corporations owning the phase ii facilities 
during construction of the phase ii project  the company  as an equity sponsor  was required to provide equity capital 
at december   the capital structure of such corporations was approximately common equity and long term debt 
see notes b and j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at times  we request that portions of our power deliveries from hydro quebec and other sources be routed through new york 
our ability to do so could be adversely affected by the proposed tariff that nepool has filed with the ferc  which would reduce our allocation of capacity on transmission interfaces with new york 
as a result  our ability to import power to vermont from outside new england could be adversely affected  thereby impacting our power costs in the future 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations transmission issues and note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hydro quebec power supply contracts 
we have several purchase power contracts with hydro quebec 
the bulk of our purchases are comprised of two schedules  b and c  pursuant to a firm contract dated december under these two schedules  we purchase mw 
under an arrangement negotiated in january  the and the contracts  we received cash payments from hydro quebec of  in and  in in accordance with such arrangement  we agreed to shift certain transmission requirements  purchase certain quantities of power and make certain minimum payments for periods in which power is not purchased 
in addition  in november  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with hydro quebec under which hydro quebec paid  to the company in exchange for certain power purchase options 
the exercise of these options in resulted in an increase of approximately million to power supply expense to meet contractual obligations under the company s sell back agreement of december with hydro quebec see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations power supply expenses  and notes i  j and k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we used  mwh under schedule b   mwh under schedule c  and  mwh under hq and to meet of our retail and requirements wholesale sales 
the average cost of hydro quebec electricity in was per kwh 
stony brook i 
the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company mmwec is principal owner and operator of stony brook  a mw combined cycle intermediate generating station located in ludlow  massachusetts  which commenced commercial operation in november we entered into a joint ownership agreement with mmwec dated as of october   whereby we acquired an ownership share of the plant  entitling us to mw of capacity 
in addition to this entitlement  we have contracted for mw of capacity for the life of the stony brook i plant  for which we will pay a proportionate share of mmwec s share of the plant s fixed costs and variable operating expenses 
the three units that comprise stony brook i are all capable of burning oil 
two of the units are also capable of burning natural gas 
the natural gas system at the plant was modified in to allow two units to operate simultaneously on natural gas

independent power producers 
the vpsb has adopted rules that implement for vermont the purchase requirements established by federal law in the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
under the rules  qualifying facilities have the option to sell their output to a central state purchasing agent under a variety of long and short term  firm and non firm pricing schedules 
each of these schedules is based upon the projected vermont composite system s power costs that would be required but for the purchases from independent producers 
the state purchasing agent assigns the energy so purchased  and the costs of purchase  to each vermont retail electric utility based upon its pro rata share of total vermont retail energy sales 
utilities may also contract directly with producers 
the rules provide that all reasonable costs incurred by a utility under the rules will be included in the utilities revenue requirements for rate making purposes 
currently  the state purchasing agent  vermont electric power producers  inc 
veppi  is authorized to seek mw of power from qualifying facilities under purpa  of which our average pro rata share in was approximately or mw 
the rated capacity of the qualifying facilities currently selling power to veppi is approximately mw 
these facilities were all online by the spring of  and no other projects are under development 
we do not expect any new projects to come online in the foreseeable future because the excess capacity in the region has eliminated the need for and value of additional qualifying facilities 
in  through both our direct contracts and veppi  we purchased  mwh of qualifying facilities production to meet of our retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of per kwh 
short term opportunity purchases and sales 
we have arrangements with numerous utilities and power marketers actively trading power in new england and new york under which we may make purchases or sales of power on short notice and generally for brief periods of time when it appears economic to do so 
opportunity purchases are arranged when it is possible to purchase power for less than it would cost us to generate the power with our own sources 
purchases also help us save on replacement power costs during an outage of one of our base load sources 
opportunity sales are arranged when we have surplus energy available at a price that is economic to other regional utilities at any given time 
the sales are arranged based on forecasted costs of supplying the incremental power necessary to serve the sale 
prices are set so as to recover all of the forecasted fuel or production costs and to recover some  if not all  associated capacity costs 
during  we purchased  mwh  meeting of our retail and requirements wholesale sales  at an average cost of per kwh 
company hydroelectric power 
the company wholly owns and operates eight hydroelectric generating facilities located on river systems within its service area  the largest of which has a generating output of mw 
in  these plants provided  mwh of low cost energy  meeting of our retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of per kwh based on total embedded costs and maintenance 
see state and federal regulation licensing 
velco 
the company and six other vermont electric distribution utilities own velco 
since commencing operation in  velco has transmitted power for its owners in vermont  including power from nypa and other power contracted for by vermont utilities 
velco also purchases bulk power for resale at cost to its owners  and as a member of nepool  represents all vermont electric utilities in pool arrangements and transactions 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fuel 
during  our retail and requirements wholesale sales were provided by the following fuel sources from hydro company owned  nypa  hydro quebec and from small power producers  from nuclear  from wood  from natural gas  from oil  from wind  and purchased on a short term basis from other utilities and through nepool and iso 
vermont yankee has several requirement based contracts for the four components uranium  conversion enrichment and fabrication used to produce nuclear fuel 
these contracts are executed only if the need or requirement for fuel arises 
under these contracts  any disruption of operating activity would allow vermont yankee to cancel or postpone deliveries until actually required 
the contracts extend through various time periods and contain clauses to allow vermont yankee the option to extend the agreements 
negotiation of new contracts and renegotiations of existing contracts routinely occurs  often focusing on one of the four components at a time 
the reload cost approximately million 
future reload costs will depend on market and contract prices on january   vermont yankee entered into an agreement with a former uranium supplier whereby the supplier could opt to terminate a production purchase agreement dated august  although there had been no transactions under the production purchase agreement for several years  vermont yankee maintained certain financial rights 
in consideration for the option to terminate the production purchase agreement and the subsequent exercise of the option  vermont yankee received  in  which was recorded as an offset to nuclear fuel expense 
the potential future payments over a ten year period range from zero to million 
no payments were received in under this agreement 
due to the uncertainty of this transaction  any benefits received will be recorded on a cash basis 
vermont yankee has a contract with the united states department of energy doe for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
under the terms of this contract  in exchange for the one time fee discussed below and a quarterly fee of mil per kwh of electricity generated and sold  the doe agrees to provide disposal services when a facility for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste is available  which is required by contract to be prior to january  the actual date for these disposal services is expected to be delayed many years 
doe currently estimates that a permanent disposal facility will not begin operation before a doe temporary disposal site may be provided in a few years  but no decision has been made to proceed on providing a temporary disposal site at this time 
the doe contract obligates vermont yankee to pay a one time fee of approximately million for disposal costs for all spent fuel discharged through april  although such amount has been collected in rates from the vermont yankee participants  vermont yankee has elected to defer payment of the fee to the doe as permitted by the doe contract 
the fee must be paid no later than the first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the doe 
interest accrues on the unpaid obligation based on the thirteen week treasury bill rate and is compounded quarterly 
through vermont yankee accumulated approximately million in an irrevocable trust to be used exclusively for settling this obligation at some future date  provided the doe complies with the terms of the aforementioned contract 
we do not maintain long term contracts for the supply of oil for our wholly owned oil fired peak generating stations mw 
we did not experience difficulty in obtaining oil for our own units during  and  while no assurance can be given  we do not anticipate any such difficulty during none of the utilities from which we expect to purchase oil or gas fired capacity in has advised us of grounds for doubt about maintenance of secure sources of oil and gas during the year 
wood for the mcneil plant is furnished to the burlington electric department from a variety of sources under short term contracts ranging from several weeks to six months duration 
the mcneil plant used  tons of wood chips and mill residue and million cubic feet of natural gas in the mcneil plant  assuming any needed regulatory approvals are obtained  is forecasting year consumption of wood chips to be  tons and natural gas consumption of million cubic feet 
the stony brook combined cycle generating station is capable of burning either natural gas or oil in two of its turbines 
natural gas is supplied to the plant subject to its availability 
during periods of extremely cold weather  the supplier reserves the right to discontinue deliveries to the plant in order to satisfy the demand of its residential customers 
we assume  for planning and budgeting purposes  that the plant will be supplied with gas during the months of april through november  and that it will run solely on oil during the months of december through march 
the plant maintains an oil supply sufficient to meet approximately one half of its annual needs 
wind project 
the company was selected by the united states department of energy doe and the electric power research institute epri to build a commercial scale wind powered facility 
the doe and epri provided partial funding for the wind project of approximately million 
the net cost to the company of the project  located in the southern vermont town of searsburg  was million 
the eleven wind turbines have a rating of mw and were commissioned july  in  the plant provided  mwh  meeting of the company s retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of per kwh 
energy efficiency in  gmp continued to focus its energy efficiency services on programs that encouraged customers to install energy efficient equipment when they are planning to replace or buy new equipment rather than attempting to convince them to replace equipment that is still in good working order 
this strategy  along with careful management  has helped us to drop our cost per lifetime kilowatt hour saved to cents  which is a reduction in costs since in  our energy efficiency programs saved approximately  megawatthours  above targeted savings for the year 
during the past eight years our efficiency programs have achieved a cumulative annual savings of  megawatthours  saving approximately million per year for our customers 
in  we spent approximately million on energy efficiency programs  approximately 
of our operating revenue in a statewide energy efficiency utility eeu was created by the vpsb in to manage energy efficiency programs for all utilities in vermont 
the company s customers are now billed a separate eeu charge that we remit directly to the eeu 
rate design the company seeks to design rates to encourage the shifting of electrical use from peak hours to off peak hours 
since  we have offered optional time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
currently  approximately  of the company s residential customers continue to be billed on the original time of use rate basis 
in  the company received regulatory approval for a rate design that permitted it to charge prices for electric service that reflected as accurately as possible the cost burden imposed by each customer class 
the company s rate design objectives are to provide a stable pricing structure and to accurately reflect the cost of providing electric services 
this rate structure helps to achieve these goals 
since inefficient use of electricity increases its cost  customers who are charged prices that reflect the cost of providing electrical service have real incentives to follow the most efficient usage patterns 
included in the vpsb s order approving this rate design was a requirement that the company s largest customers be charged time of use rates on a phased in basis by at december   approximately  of the company s largest customers  comprising of retail revenues  continue to receive service on mandatory time of use rates 
in may  the company filed its current rate design with the vpsb 
the parties  including the department  ibm and a low income advocacy group  entered into a settlement that was approved by the vpsb on december  under the settlement  the revenue allocation to each rate class was adjusted to reflect class by class cost changes since  the differential between the winter and summer rates was reduced  the customer charge was increased for most classes  and usage charges were adjusted to be closer to the associated marginal costs 
no modifications to base rate redesign have taken place since the vpsb order issued on december  dispatchable and interruptible service contracts in  we had interruptible dispatchable power contracts with two major ski areas and dispatchable only contracts with an additional twenty six customers 
the interruptible portion of the contracts allows the company to control power supply capacity charges by reducing our capacity requirements 
during  we did not request any interruptions due to the surplus capacity in the region 
the dispatchable portion of the contracts allows customers to purchase electricity during times designated by the company when low cost power is available 
the customer s demand during these periods is not considered in calculating the monthly billing 
this program enables the company and the customers to benefit from load control 
we shift load from our high cost peak periods and the customer uses inexpensive power at a time when its use provides maximum value 
these programs are available by tariff for qualifying customers 
construction and capital requirements our capital expenditures for through and projection for are set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources construction 
construction projections are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time in accordance with changes in the company s financial condition  load forecasts  the availability and cost of labor and materials  licensing and other regulatory requirements  changing environmental standards and other relevant factors 
for the period  internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provided approximately percent of total capital requirements for construction  sinking fund obligations and other requirements 
internally generated funds provided percent of such requirements for we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations  the remainder to be derived from bank loans

the current indicated annual dividend is per share of common stock 
our current dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply  and the rate case developments discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  rates retail rate case 
the current environment prompted us to reassess the appropriateness of our traditional dividend policy 
historically  we based our dividend policy on the continued validity of three assumptions the ability to achieve earnings growth  the receipt of an allowed rate of return that accurately reflects our cost of capital  and the retention of our exclusive franchise 
the company s board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend  when appropriate  as the vermont electric industry evolves towards competition 
in addition  if other events beyond our control cause the company s financial situation to deteriorate further  the board of directors will also consider whether the current dividend level is appropriate or if the dividend should be reduced or eliminated

     item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for green mountain power corporation the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affects our overall financial condition 
there are statements in this section that contain projections or estimates and that are considered to be forward looking as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different are discussed under future outlook  transmission issues  environmental matters  rates and liquidity and capital resources in this section  and include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation  weather  energy supply and demand and pricing  contractual commitments  availability  terms  and use of capital  general economic and business environment  nuclear and environmental issues  and industry restructuring and cost recovery including stranded costs 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary the company lost per average share of common stock in  compared to a loss per share of in and earnings per share of in the loss represents a negative return on average common equity of percent 
the return on average common equity was negative percent in and positive percent in earnings from continuing operations were per share in  compared to a loss of per share in certain subsidiary operations  classified as discontinued in  lost per share in  compared to a loss of per share in the loss was primarily due to a charge of million for the discontinuation of operations of mountain energy  inc mei  a subsidiary of the company that operates wastewater  energy efficiency and generation businesses 
the company anticipates that it will sell these operations during the improvement in results from continuing operations is primarily due to three factors retail operating revenues increased by million  reflecting a percent temporary rate increase that went into effect on december   and a percent increase in sales to commercial and industrial customers in  operating costs were million lower in due to the company s termination of its corporate headquarters lease  reduced costs associated with the company s headquarters facilities and lower payroll expense reflecting mid year reductions in the number of employees  results for reflected pretax charges of million in disallowed hydro quebec power costs for both and  compared to disallowed power costs of million for recorded in the ultimate rate treatment of the hydro quebec power costs is expected to be determined in the company s pending rate case 
the earnings improvements were partially offset by a million increase in the capacity costs in associated with our long term hydro quebec power supply contract  an increase in the costs of short term power following the deregulation of energy markets in new england  as well as an increase in our costs to serve increased local loads and an increase of approximately million to supply power to meet contractual obligations under the company s sell back agreement of december with hydro quebec  and a million increase in vermont yankee capacity costs 
the decrease in earnings in resulted primarily from the following a rate decision by the vermont public service board vpsb in february that disallowed recovery of million for hydro quebec power supply expenses and other costs  a million loss accrued in resulting from the assumed continued disallowance of hydro quebec power costs during  higher power supply expenses resulting from a one time million payment received from hydro quebec in that reduced power supply expenses accordingly  a million charge associated with terminating the company s corporate headquarters lease and with workforce reductions in  and a million after tax loss experienced by mountain energy  inc in  as compared to earnings of  in  resulting from a million net write off of a wind power investment and continued start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  a wholly owned wastewater treatment investment 
this loss was substantially offset by a million reduction in losses experienced by green mountain resources  inc gmri due to the absence of start up expenses in  as compared to future outlook competition and restructuring the electric utility business is experiencing rapid and substantial changes 
these changes are the result of the following trends surplus generating capacity  disparity in electric rates among and within various regions of the country  improvements in generation efficiency  increasing demand for customer choice  and new regulations and legislation intended to foster competition  also known as restructuring 
electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
as a result  competition for retail customers has been limited to competition with alternative fuel suppliers  primarily for heating and cooling  competition with customer owned generation  and direct competition among electric utilities to attract major new facilities to their service territories 
these competitive pressures have led the company and other utilities to offer  from time to time  special discounts or service packages to certain large customers 
in certain states across the country  including the new england states  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems also known as retail wheeling 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales at the wholesale and retail levels 
in the future  the vermont general assembly through legislation  or the vpsb through a subsequent report  action or proceeding  may allow customers to choose their electric supplier 
if this happens without providing for recovery of a significant portion of the costs associated with our power supply contracts  the company s franchise  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at the current level  would be adversely affected 
if actions by the vermont general assembly or the vpsb imperil the company s financial integrity  we will evaluate all potential alternatives available to us at that time  including  but not limited to  eliminating common stock dividends  or the filing of a petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code 
item a 
risk factors the major risk factors for the company arising from electric industry restructuring  including risks pertaining to the recovery of stranded costs  are regulatory and legal decisions  the market price of power  and the amount of market share retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that any final restructuring plan ordered by the vpsb  the courts  or through legislation will include a mechanism that would allow for full recovery of our stranded costs and include a fair return on those costs as they are being recovered 
if laws are enacted or regulatory decisions are made that do not offer an adequate opportunity to recover stranded costs  we believe we have compelling legal arguments to challenge such laws or decisions 
the largest category of our potential stranded costs is future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  have resulted in estimates of the company s stranded costs of between million and million 
we intend to aggressively pursue mitigation efforts in order to maximize the recovery of these costs 
if retail competition is implemented in vermont  it cannot now be predicted what the impact would be on the company s revenues from electricity sales 
historically  electric utility rates have been based on a utility s cost of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards number  sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company has established regulatory assets and liabilities under sfas see liquidity and capital resources and rates for additional information related to sfas the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations of an amount that would be material 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulator s approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  increasing competition that limits our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs  regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
under statement of financial accounting standards number sfas  accounting for contingencies  the enactment of restructuring legislation or issuance of a regulatory order containing provisions that do not allow for the recovery of above market power costs would require the company to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
we are unable to predict what form enacted legislation or such an order will take  and we cannot predict if or to what extent sfas will continue to be applicable in the future 
in addition  members of the staff of the securities and exchange commission have raised questions concerning the continued applicability of sfas to certain other electric utilities facing restructuring 
statement of financial accounting standards number sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  requires that any assets  including regulatory assets  that are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues be revalued based upon future cash flows 
sfas requires that a rate regulated enterprise recognize an impairment loss for regulatory assets that are no longer probable of recovery 
as of december   based upon the regulatory environment within which we currently operate  no impairment loss was recorded 
competitive influences or regulatory developments  including issues pending in the company s currently stayed rate case  may impact this status in the future 
we cannot predict whether restructuring legislation enacted by the vermont general assembly or any subsequent report or actions of  or proceedings before  the vpsb or the vermont general assembly would have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
the failure to recover a significant portion of our purchased power costs  or to retain and attract customers in a competitive environment  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels 
for a discussion of a major risk factor arising from vermont regulatory treatment of the company s recent rate filings  see liquidity and capital resources and rates 
unregulated businesses in  we continued to significantly reduce our investment in unregulated businesses 
in june  we decided to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of mei  and report its results as income loss from operations of a discontinued segment 
mei  which has invested in energy generation  energy efficiency and waste water treatment projects  lost million in  compared to a loss of million in the loss results primarily from provisions to recognize our estimate of future losses from the expected sale of mei s businesses  including anticipated operating losses 
the decrease in earnings was due primarily to additional start up operating losses incurred by micronair  llc and a write off related to a wind facility in california 
green mountain resources  inc gmri was formed in april to explore opportunities in the emerging competitive retail energy market 
in  gmri earned  compared to a loss of  in gmri s earnings in was primarily due to the sale of its remaining interest in green mountain energy resources gmer to green funding i  llc

   differences in operating revenues were due to changes in the following change in operating revenues to to in thousands retail rates   retail sales volume   resales and other revenues   increase in operating revenues   in  total electricity sales increased percent due principally to sales for resale executed pursuant to the morgan stanley ms agreement  described in more detail below under the heading power supply expense 
total operating revenues increased million or percent in for the same reason 
total retail revenues increased million or percent in primarily due to a percent retail rate increase for service rendered on or after december   a percent increase in sales of electricity to our commercial and industrial customers resulting from customer growth and increased use of air conditioning during the spring and summer months  and a percent increase in sales of electricity to residential customers  a result of customer growth and a warmer than normal summer 
total operating revenues increased percent in total retail revenues increased percent in primarily due to a percent increase in sales of electricity to our commercial and industrial customers resulting from increased use of air conditioning during the spring and summer months  and a percent retail rate increase for service rendered on or after march the increase was partially offset by a percent reduction in sales to residential customers caused by warmer than normal winter months 
wholesale revenues decreased percent in primarily due to a reduction in low margin  off system sales 
international business machines ibm  the company s single largest customer  operates manufacturing facilities in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its main plant and an adjacent plant accounted for   and percent of the company s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any such year 
the percentage decrease from to reflects ms agreement transactions  revenues from ibm actually increased in since  the company has had agreements with ibm with respect to electricity sales above agreed upon base load levels 
in august  the agreement was renewed for the year the agreement s price of power for the renewal period continues to be above our marginal costs of providing incremental service to ibm 
we have agreed to negotiate with ibm for a new agreement covering a three year period beginning january  with terms and conditions similar to those existing 
any new agreement will be subject to approval by the vpsb 
power supply expenses power supply expenses constituted   and percent of total operating expenses for the years   and  respectively 
power supply expenses increased by million or percent in and million or percent in the increase in power supply expenses from to resulted from the following a million increase reflecting the power purchase and supply contract discussed below  whereby we buy power from ms that is sufficient to serve pre established load requirements at a pre defined price  a million increase in the capacity costs in associated with our long term hydro quebec power supply contract  an increase in the costs of short term power following the deregulation of energy markets in new england  as well as an increase in our costs to serve increased local loads and to supply power to meet contractual obligations under the company s sell back agreement of december with hydro quebec net cost approximately million  and a million increase in vermont yankee capacity costs 
these amounts were partially offset by a reduction of million in losses accrued for the hydro quebec power cost disallowance 
results for reflected pretax charges of million in disallowed hydro quebec power costs for both and  compared to disallowed power costs of million for recorded in ultimate disposition of the disallowance associated with hydro quebec power costs is expected to be determined in the company s pending rate case 
the power supply costs of company owned generation decreased percent in due to the severe ice storm in new england that caused increased usage of peak generation resources to replace power that was unavailable from hydro quebec 
total power supply expenses increased percent from to primarily due to the absence in of the million reduction of hydro quebec power costs resulting from the rate treatment of a payment received from hydro quebec in  a million loss accrued in resulting from the continued disallowance of hydro quebec power costs during  and a million increase in scheduled hydro quebec contract capacity costs in company owned generation costs increased percent in due to an increase in the use of high cost generating facilities that replaced power that was unavailable from hydro quebec during a severe ice storm that affected much of vermont  the northeast united states and qu bec in january an independent system operator in new england iso replaced the new england power pool nepool effective may  the iso works as a clearinghouse for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the new deregulated markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
we must purchase electricity to meet customer demand during periods of high usage and to replace energy repurchased by hydro quebec under an arrangement negotiated in our costs to serve demand during periods of warmer than normal temperatures in summer months and to replace such energy repurchases by hydro quebec rose substantially after the iso replaced nepool as the governing power supply 
the cost of securing future power supplies has also risen substantially in tandem with higher summer supply costs 
the company cannot predict the duration or the extent to which future prices will continue to trade above historical levels of cost 
if the new markets continue to experience the volatility evident in the second and third quarters of  our earnings and cash flow could be adversely impacted by a material amount 
power contract commitments during  we negotiated an arrangement with hydro quebec that reduced the cost under the contract over the november through october period the july agreement 
as part of the july agreement  we were obligated to purchase million in dollars worth of research and development work from hydro quebec over a four year period  and made a million in dollars payment to hydro quebec in hydro quebec retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in qu bec 
under an arrangement executed in january  we received payments from hydro quebec of million in and million in the million payment reduced purchase power expense by million in  the balance of the payment reduced power costs in the million payment reduced purchase power expense ratably over the period beginning june and ending may we received vpsb approval of this accounting treatment in an accounting order dated december  under the arrangement we are required to shift up to megawatts of deliveries to an alternate transmission path  and use the associated portion of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection facilities to purchase power for the period from september through june at prices that vary based upon conditions in effect when the purchases are made 
the arrangement also provides for minimum payments by the company to hydro quebec for periods in which power is not purchased under the arrangement 
although our level of benefits will depend on various factors  we estimate that the arrangement will provide a benefit of approximately million on a net present value basis 
under a separate agreement executed on december   hydro quebec paid million to the company in in return for this payment  we provided hydro quebec an option for the purchase of power 
commencing april  and effective through the term of the contract  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis  at energy prices established in accordance with the contract 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased over the remaining term of the contract shall not exceed  mwh 
hydro quebec s option to curtail energy deliveries pursuant to the july agreement can be exercised in addition to these purchase options 
over the same period  hydro quebec may exercise an option on an annual basis to purchase a total of  mwh at the contract energy price 
hydro quebec may purchase no more than  mwh in any given year 
in  hydro quebec called for deliveries to third parties at a net cost of approximately million 
in  hydro quebec called on us to deliver  mwh to a third party at a net cost to us of  which was due to higher energy replacement costs 
see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company and the other vermont joint owners vjo of the hydro quebec contract initiated an arbitration against hydro quebec  pursuant to the contract terms  to determine whether the suspension of deliveries of power to vermont during and after the january ice storm evidenced a default by hydro quebec under the terms of the contract 
hydro quebec maintains that the force majeure superior or irreversible force provision in the contract applies  which could excuse its non delivery of power under these circumstances 
arbitration of the dispute may lead to remedies having a material impact on our contractual obligation  including the possibility that the contract be declared terminated or void 
on february   we entered into a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc ms as a result of our power requirements solicitation in a master power purchase and sales agreement ppsa dated february  defines the general contract terms under which the parties may transact 
the sales under the ppsa commenced on february  and will terminate after all obligations under each transaction entered into by ms and the company has been fulfilled  currently anticipated to be january  the ppsa has been noticed to the vpsb and filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the ppsa provides us with a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
on a daily basis  and at ms s discretion  we sell power to ms from either i all or part of our portfolio of power resources at predefined operating and pricing parameters or ii any power resources available to us  provided that sales of power from sources other than company owned generation comply with the predefined operating and pricing parameters 
ms then sells to us  at a predefined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
ms is also responsible for balancing supply resources when actual loads vary from the pre established load requirements 
we remain responsible for resource performance and availability  however ms provides coverage against major unscheduled outages  up to million annually  contingent upon both the price and availability of power resources 
the parties have agreed to the protocols that are used to schedule power sales and purchases between the parties and to secure necessary transmission with respect to the two transactions described above 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million or percent in the decrease results from a million estimated loss in to recognize the cost of terminating the corporate headquarters operating lease 
the facilities were sold in april a million reduction in administrative and general salaries related to a workforce reduction plan  the elimination in a regulatory liability of million relating to former corporate headquarters  reductions in lease expense and facility carrying costs resulting from the disposal of the former headquarters  and these savings were partially offset by increased costs of approximately million associated with our reorganization 
transmission expenses transmission expenses increased million or percent in due to costs associated with the creation of the iso as the clearing house for power trades in new england and due to refunds in from central vermont public service corp 
cvps and new england power company 
transmission expenses decreased percent in primarily due to a refund received from cvps in as a result of reduced levels of demand on the cvps transmission system in we also received a refund in for charges that were incorrectly assessed to us during by new england power company 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased million or percent in  reflecting increased expenditures on right of way maintenance programs 
maintenance expenses increased percent in primarily due to scheduled plant maintenance activities at the stony brook plant and the repair of damage caused by lightning at our wind facility 
depreciation and amortization in  depreciation and amortization were nearly identical to that of in  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased percent primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site as a result of the vpsb order of february   which suspended the amortization charges 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expenses associated with additional investment in our utility plant 
income taxes the total effective federal and state income tax rates for the years  and were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
income taxes decreased for due to a decrease in taxable income 
income taxes decreased in due to a decrease in taxable income 
other income other income increased million in  due to the gain on sale of the remaining interest in gmer discussed previously under unregulated business  and a million write off in of disallowed costs of our searsburg wind project 
other income decreased million in  primarily due to a million loss experienced by mountain energy  inc resulting from a million net write off of a wind power investment in california and start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  and a million disallowance in costs associated with the vermont wind facility ordered by the vpsb in its february  order 
in addition  the allowance for funds used during construction decreased in resulting from lower construction work in progress balances during the period 
these decreases were partially offset by million reduction in losses experienced by gmri due to the absence of start up expenses in as compared to interest charges interest expense decreased million or percent in  consistent with reductions in average long term and short term debt outstanding during the year 
interest charges increased million or percent in primarily due to an increase in short term interest expense related to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding during the year  and a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in long term interest charges related to a lower amount of long term debt outstanding in dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock decreased  or percent in due to repurchases of preferred stock 
in  the dividends on preferred stock also decreased  or percent for the same reason 
transmission issues federal open access tariff orders on april   the federal energy regulatory commission issued orders and which  among other things  required the filing of open access transmission tariffs by electric utilities  and the functional separation by utilities of their transmission operations from power marketing operations 
order also supports the full recovery of legitimate and verifiable wholesale power costs previously incurred under federal or state regulation 
on july   the ferc approved our open access transmission tariff  and on august  we filed our compliance refund report 
in accordance with order  we have also functionally separated our transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for our transmission operations 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to the ferc orders mentioned above 
environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations  except for developments related to the pine street barge canal site 
we maintain programs to ensure that we are in compliance with environmental regulations 
these programs include employee training  regular inspection of our facilities  research and development projects  waste handling and spill prevention procedures  program monitoring and other activities 
pine street barge canal site the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund law  generally imposes strict  joint and several liability  regardless of fault  for remediation of property contaminated with hazardous substances 
we have previously been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that we are one of several potentially responsible parties prps for cleanup of the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont  where coal tar and other industrial materials were deposited 
in september  we negotiated a final settlement with the united states  the state of vermont state  and other parties to a consent decree that covers claims with respect to the site and implementation of the selected site cleanup remedy 
in november  the consent decree was filed in the federal district court 
the consent decree addresses claims by the epa for past pine street barge canal site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future oversight costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
as of december   our total expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site since were approximately million 
this includes amounts not recovered in rates  amounts recovered in rates  and amounts for which rate recovery has been sought but which are presently awaiting further vpsb action 
the bulk of these expenditures consisted of transaction costs 
transaction costs include legal and consulting costs associated with the company s opposition to the epa s earlier proposals for a more expensive remedy at the site  litigation and related costs necessary to obtain settlements with insurers and other prp s to provide amounts required to fund the clean up remediation costs  and to address liability claims at the site 
a smaller amount of past expenditures was for site related response costs  including costs incurred pursuant to epa and state orders that resulted in funding response activities at the site  and to reimbursing the epa and the state for oversight and related response costs 
the epa and the state have asserted and affirmed that all costs related to these orders are appropriate costs of response under cercla for which the company and other prps were legally responsible 
we estimate that we have recovered or secured  or will recover  through settlements of litigation claims against insurers and other parties  amounts that exceed estimated future remediation costs  future federal and state government oversight costs and past epa response costs 
we have recently concluded that our unrecovered transaction costs mentioned above  which were necessary to recover settlements sufficient to remediate the site  to oppose much more costly solutions proposed by the epa  and to resolve monetary claims of the epa and the state  together with our remediation costs  are more likely to be in the range of to million  rather than the previous estimate of to million 
in  we recorded a liability of million to recognize the low end of the initial range of costs 
in we recorded an additional liability of million to reflect revised estimates of site monitoring costs to be incurred over the next years 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we also have recorded an offsetting regulatory asset and we believe that it is probable that we will receive future revenues to recover these costs 
through rate cases filed in    and  we sought and received recovery for ongoing expenses associated with the pine street barge canal site 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of full rate recovery of the site related costs  the company and the vermont department of public service  the department  and as applicable  other parties  reached agreements in these cases that the full amount of the site related costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
we proposed in our rate filing made on june  recovery of an additional million in such expenditures 
in an order in that case released march   the vpsb suspended the amortization of expenditures associated with the pine street barge canal site pending further proceedings 
although it did not eliminate the rate base deferral of these expenditures  or make any specific order in this regard  the vpsb indicated that it was inclined to agree with other parties in the case that the ultimate costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  taking into account recoveries from insurance carriers and other prp s  should be shared between customers and shareholders of the company 
in response to our motion for reconsideration  the vpsb on june  stated its intent was to reserve for a future docket issues pertaining to the sharing of remediation related costs between the company and its customers 
see rates retail rate case below 
clean air act because we purchase most of our power supply from other utilities  we do not anticipate that we will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air act or proposals to make more stringent regulations under that act 
furthermore  only one of our power supply purchase contracts  which expired in early  related to a generating plant that was affected by phase i of the acid rain provisions of this legislation  which went into effect january  rates retail rate case on june   the company filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent million in additional annual revenues and to increase the target return on common equity from percent to percent 
in our final submissions to the vpsb we asked for an increase of percent million in additional annual revenues due to changed estimates of costs to be incurred in the rate year 
on march   the vpsb released its order dated february  in the then pending rate case 
the vpsb authorized us to increase our rates by percent  which gave us increased annual revenues of million 
the difference between the million we asked for and the million the vpsb authorized was due to the following disallowance of the cost of power associated with the hydro quebec contract discussed below  the vpsb s modification of our calculation of rate base  the exclusion of future capital projects from rate base  suspension of recovery of pine street barge canal site expenditures  various cost of service reductions in payroll and operations and maintenance  and a reduction in our requested allowed return on equity from percent to percent 
the vpsb order denied us the right to charge customers million of the annual costs for power purchased under our contract with hydro quebec 
the vpsb denied recovery of these costs for the following reasons the vpsb claimed that we had acted imprudently by committing to the power contract with hydro quebec in august the imprudence disallowance  and to the extent that the costs of power to be purchased from hydro quebec are now higher than current estimates of market prices for power during the contract term  after accounting for the imprudence disallowance  the contract power is not used and useful 
generally accepted accounting principles required that we record in the first quarter of the losses resulting from the disallowed recovery of a portion of the hydro quebec power contract costs 
the amount charged to first quarter income of million pre tax was less than the full disallowance because we expected that new rates would become effective in january as the result of our may  rate filing  discussed below 
in its february  order  the vpsb talked about its policies that do not allow a utility to recover imprudent expenditures and the costs of power supply contract purchases that the vpsb decides are not used and useful 
the vpsb stated in its order that the methods and measures used in this rate case were provisional and applied to this rate case only 
if the vpsb were to apply the same  or similar  methods and measures that they used in the rate case order to future power contract costs in our retail rate case  we would likely be required to recognize a charge to income of approximately million before income taxes 
the million estimate represents primarily the percent disallowance for hydro quebec power costs that the vpsb considered imprudent in its order 
we are unable to estimate the loss from disallowance to be recorded for power purchased after december   if any  until the pending rate case is completed 
sfas provides guidance in preparing financial statements for public utilities that meet certain criteria of sfas the three criteria that we must meet in order to follow that accounting guidance are our rates for regulated services and products provided to our customers must be established by or be subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  the regulated rates are designed to recover our specific costs of providing the regulated services or products  and depending on demand for regulated services and products  and the level of competition  direct and indirect  it is reasonable to assume that our rates are set at levels that will recover our costs and that these rates can be charged to and collected from our customers 
this criterion must also take into account anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
we meet these criteria presently  and under sfas we are required to defer certain costs that would typically be accounted for as expense in an unregulated entity  these costs are referred to as deferred charges or regulatory assets 
our ability to defer a cost is subject to our ability to provide evidence that the following additional criteria are met it is probable that the inclusion of the capitalized deferred cost in allowed costs for rate making purposes will provide future revenue in an amount at least equal to the capitalized deferred cost  and the future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the previously incurred cost rather than to provide for expected levels of similar future costs 
if the vpsb does not modify its ruling that the costs of power purchased from hydro quebec are above estimated market rates and are not used and useful and  therefore  a portion of such costs is not recoverable  we would likely conclude that the vpsb has changed its approach to setting rates from cost based rate making to another form of regulation 
we would then be required to discontinue application of sfas and eliminate all regulatory assets and liabilities that arose from prior actions of the vpsb 
the write off of these regulatory assets and liabilities  net of any tax effects  would be charged to income as an extraordinary item for the financial reporting period in which the discontinuation of sfas occurs 
based on the december  balance sheet  if we were required to discontinue the application of sfas  we would be required to recognize an after tax charge to earnings of approximately million attributable to net regulatory assets 
on march   we filed with the vpsb a motion for reconsideration of and to alter or amend certain aspects of the vpsb s order released on march  immediately following the issuance of the june  vpsb order on our motion for reconsideration  which mainly reaffirmed the earlier order  duff phelps and standard poor s lowered our securities credit ratings 
moody s also subsequently lowered our securities credit ratings 
in june  we appealed the vpsb s february  order and the june  reconsideration order to the vermont supreme court 
the briefing of the case by all parties was completed in january a number of other vermont utilities submitted briefs in support of the company 
oral arguments were presented to the vermont supreme court on march  we believe that the decisions in the vpsb s february  order and june  reconsideration order are factually inaccurate and legally incorrect 
specifically  we are appealing the vpsb s determination that we were imprudent in committing to the hydro quebec contract in august   and its ruling that because the contract power is priced over market under current forecasts of market prices  it is therefore considered not used and useful 
the company asserts  among other arguments  that the vpsb s order deprives the company s shareholders of their property in an unconstitutional manner 
if not changed  the vpsb s decision could have a significant negative impact on our reported financial condition  and could impact our credit ratings  dividend policy and financial viability 
retail rate case on may   we filed a request with the vpsb to increase our retail rates by percent due to higher power costs  the cost of the january ice storm  and investments in new plant and equipment 
the vpsb suspended the tariff filings on june  we submitted testimony in the case that included analysis of viable alternatives to the hydro quebec contract at various times in and the vpsb had taken the viewpoint in our rate case that we would have been able to terminate the hydro quebec contract without penalty during that time period  and would have been able to access the market for power at that time 
our analysis showed that  based on price only  the hydro quebec contract was less expensive than virtually all other long term power resources available at that time 
the analysis also showed that when other non price benefits  like environmental benefits and the reliability of a system power resource  are taken into account  the hydro quebec contract was still less costly than alternatives 
we have testified that even today  when costs and benefits for society are accounted for  as vermont regulators and statutes require  the hydro quebec power is not more costly than market power 
in testimony submitted on september   the department argued for a million disallowance of hydro quebec contract costs  a rate decrease of percent  the elimination of our common stock dividend  and various other restrictions 
ibm  our largest customer  argued for a rate decrease of percent  a disallowance of hydro quebec power costs in the amount of million  and the elimination of the common stock dividend 
on november   by memorandum of understanding mou  the company  the department and ibm agreed to stay rate proceedings in the rate case until or after september   or such earlier date as the parties may later agree to or the vpsb may order 
the agreement to suspend our rate case delayed the date of a final decision on the rate case to december   and we recognized an additional loss of million in the last quarter of representing the effect of the continued disallowance of hydro quebec costs through december  the mou provided for a temporary retail rate increase  to produce million in annualized additional revenue  effective with service rendered december  in the event that the vpsb issues a final order that allows a retail rate increase that is less than the temporary rates  all sums collected in excess of such final rates would be refunded by adjusting rates on a prospective basis  by customer class  to reflect the appropriate refund amounts 
at december   total revenues subject to refund are approximately million 
an additional surcharge was permitted  without further vpsb order  in order to produce additional revenues necessary to provide the company with the capacity to finance pine street barge canal site expenditures 
the mou was approved by the vpsb on december  the mou did not provide for any specific disallowance of power costs under our purchase power contract with hydro quebec 
issues respecting recovery of such power costs were preserved for future proceedings 
the temporary rates included million that is to be used for enhanced right of way maintenance and pole testing and treatment 
also  in the event that the vermont supreme court issues an order reversing the vpsb s orders in our rate case prior to issuance of a final order in the rate case  any resulting adjustments in rates will not become effective until the vpsb issues a final order in the rate case 
the mou provides that nothing in it will reduce or limit our entitlement to full recovery of any amounts due us if we should prevail on the appeal 
the stay and suspension of this pending rate case and the temporary rate levels agreed to in the mou were designed to allow us to continue to provide adequate and efficient service to our customers while we seek mitigation of power supply costs 
on september and december   the vpsb issued orders approving two amendments to the mou that the company had entered into with the department and ibm 
the two amendments continued the stay of proceedings until september   with a final decision expected by december  the amendments maintained the other features of the original mou  and the second amendment provides for a temporary rate increase of percent  in addition to the current temporary rate level  to become effective as of january  the temporary rates are still subject to refund in the final rate case decision  if the final rates set are lower than the temporary rates 
one party to the rate case  the american association of retired persons aarp  has filed an appeal to the vermont supreme court of the vpsb s order of december   arguing that the vpsb should have ordered the company to post a bond or escrow for the temporary rate increase 
the company has moved to dismiss the appeal 
notwithstanding the interim rate settlement  we are unable to predict whether the mou or other future events  singularly or in combination  could cause our lending banks to refuse to allow further borrowings under our revolving loan agreement  to seek to enter into a new credit agreement with us and or to immediately call in all outstanding loans 
if we are unable to borrow on a short term basis  we will evaluate all potential alternatives available at the time  including  but not limited to  the reduction or elimination of common stock dividends or the filing of a petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code 
liquidity and capital resources construction our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
if restructuring does occur  we will reassess our capital expenditures for generation and other projects and the terms of financing thereof 
capital expenditures over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution conservation other total dollars in thousands  net of afudc and customer advances for construction actual forecast includes million for searsburg wind farm includes million for pine street barge canal site a statewide energy efficiency utility eeu has been set up by the vpsb to manage all energy efficiency programs 
the company s customers are now billed a separate eeu charge that we remit directly to the eeu dividend policy on november   the board of directors of the company announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend on the company s common stock from per share to per share 
the annual dividend rate was per share at december  our current dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply  as well as earnings projections associated with the rate case developments referred to above 
our current environment has prompted us to reassess the appropriateness of our traditional dividend policy 
the board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend  when appropriate as the vermont electricity industry evolves towards competition 
in addition  if other events beyond our control cause our financial situation to deteriorate further  the board of directors will also consider whether the current dividend level is appropriate or if the dividend should be reduced or eliminated 
financing and capitalization internally generated funds provided approximately percent of requirements for  and combined 
internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provide capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements 
we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations 
at december   our capitalization consisted of percent common equity  percent long term debt and percent preferred equity 
on june   we renewed a revolving credit agreement with two banks 
the agreement is for a period of days and will expire on june  the commitment of million represents a reduction from the previous commitment of million 
we believe the amounts available under the new agreement will be sufficient to meet our forecasted borrowing requirements during the day period 
the terms continue the requirement that loans made under the agreement will be secured by granting the banks a second priority mortgage  lien and security interest in the collateral pledged under the company s first mortgage bond indenture 
we also have an uncommitted line of credit in the amount of  under which no amounts were outstanding at december  the revolving credit agreement requires us to certify on a quarterly basis that we have not suffered a material adverse change 
similarly  as a condition to further borrowings  we must certify that nothing has happened that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on us since the date that we last borrowed under this agreement 
our agreement allows us to continue to borrow until such time that a material adverse effect has occurred  we are no longer in compliance with all other provisions of the agreement  in which case further borrowing will not be permitted  or there has been a material adverse change  in which case the banks may declare us in default 
there are a number of future events that  singularly or in combination  could lead the banks to refuse to allow further borrowings under the existing credit agreement  to seek to enter into a new credit agreement with us and or to immediately call in all outstanding loans 
some of those events are the vpsb issues an order in our pending rate case that triggers a material adverse change for us  or hydro quebec is unwilling to make new arrangements regarding the cost of power that we purchase under our contract with them 
on november   while negotiations for an additional temporary rate increase with department and ibm were ongoing but before any agreement was reached  the banks requested that the total amount available to the company under the existing revolving credit agreement be reduced from million to million 
in order to have access to borrowed funds needed at that time  the company agreed to the banks request 
subsequent to the vpsb approval of an additional percent rate increase in december  the banks agreed to maintain the total amount available at million 
the total amount available will be reduced by the net proceeds from certain sales of the company s assets  such as the assets of mei 
if we are unable to borrow on a short term basis  we will evaluate all potential alternatives available to us at the time  including  but not limited to  the filing of a petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code

duff phelps  moody s and standard poor s credit ratings for the company remain on rating watch down  review for possible further downgrade  and credit watch negative  respectively  due to the high level of regulatory and public policy uncertainty in vermont and certain positions argued by the department in our rate cases 
see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the bank credit facilities available to the company 
year computer compliance we experienced no interruption in the delivery of electricity due to the transition from december  to january  we also have not experienced any significant events related to the year transition on any of our software applications or embedded systems 
potential problems with future dates continue to pose risk to the company 
our ability to deliver electricity to our customers could also be impacted if one of our major power suppliers or vendors of telecommunication service experienced a date related system failure 
an interruption in power supplied by other delivery systems  such as the independent system operator iso for new england  could also cause power delivery problems for us 
the contingency planning process implemented by the company during remains in place 
the phases of our contingency planning process include business impact analysis and contingency planning and testing  and include testing of year dates that pose continual risk 
business impact analysis requires business unit personnel to evaluate the impact of mission critical systems failure on our core business operations  focusing on specific failure scenarios and how they can be mitigated 
the necessary conditions for enacting the plans were documented along with the appropriate personnel responsible in each of the business units should a year failure occur 
additionally  we have participated in system readiness drills to stimulate major outages and restart capability 
the total cost of upgrading software that would not otherwise have been replaced in accordance with our business plans is approximately  approximately  has been expended as of december  for external labor  hardware and software costs  and for the costs of employees who are dedicated to the year project 
the foregoing amounts do not include the cost of new software applications installed as a result of strategic replacement projects 
such replacement projects were not accelerated because of year issues 
we believe that our planning was adequate to secure year readiness of our critical systems 
nevertheless  maintaining year security is subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are described above 
we are not able to predict all the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially form our current expectations as to our year readiness 
however  if we  or third parties with whom we have significant business relationships  fail to maintain year readiness with respect to critical systems  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
nuclear decommissioning the staff of the sec has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating units in financial statements 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board had agreed to review the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning 
we do not believe that changes in such accounting  if required  would have an adverse effect on the results of operations due to our current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt
