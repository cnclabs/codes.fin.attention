funds from operations and funds available for distribution funds from operations ffo  which is a commonly used measurement of the performance of an equity reit  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc  is net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
management believes the presentation of ffo and funds available for distribution fad are useful disclosures as general measures of its performance in the real estate industry  although the company s ffo and fad may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo and fad do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
fad is defined as ffo less non revenue producing capital expenditures  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  straight line rent adjustments plus amortization of deferred financing costs and restricted stock awards 
ffo  fad and cash flow information for each of the three years in the period ended december  are summarized in the following table in s  except per share data funds from operations unaudited income before distributions to preferred unitholders  minority interest  extraordinary item and net income allocated to preferred shareholders    less plus gains on sales of real estate    depreciation and amortization related to real estate   termination of employment agreements and options and warrants buyout  other adjustments equity in earnings losses from equity method investments  ffo contribution loss from equity method investments funds from operations    funds available for distribution unaudited funds from operations    capitalized expenditures   tenant improvements  leasing commissions  amortization of deferred financing costs  amortization of restricted stock awards straight line rent adjustments   funds available for distribution   cash flow information cash flow from operating activities    cash flow from investing activities    cash flow from financing activities    net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   weighted average number of common shares and units and preferred shares and units diluted    for  this diluted share amount differs from the amount used for earnings per share eps as it includes the common share equivalents issuable upon conversion of preferred units and preferred stock which are anti dilutive for eps reporting and dilutive for ffo reporting 
inflation the company s leases for commercial office and industrial properties generally require tenants to pay either their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance or pay of these costs directly for triple net leases  as a result  the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses is reduced 
the company does not anticipate that inflation will have a significant impact on its operating results in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility as interest on the credit facility is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility represents approximately of debt outstanding as of december  the company also utilizes mortgage debt with fixed rates as a source of capital 
the weighted average maturity for fixed rate debt  excluding the credit facility  was years at december  as these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
if the interest rate for the credit facility was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
approximately million of the company s fixed rate debt matures in the company currently intends to refinance this maturing obligation in if interest rates for this fixed rate debt maturing and to be refinanced in is basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
impact of recent accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the year readiness disclosure the company has experienced no problems or issues relating to the year problem on or after january  the company has fully implemented its year compliance program and as part of that program intends to maintain its contingency plans until the company is satisfied that business operations will not be adversely impacted by the possibility of a year problem 
based upon the company s experience of no year problems to date  the company believes that this approach will adequately compensate for any year problems which may still arise
