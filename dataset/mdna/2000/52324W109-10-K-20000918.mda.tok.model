excluding license fees  revenues in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal year revenues from digital oscilloscopes and related products declined  or million  from million in fiscal to million in this reduction in revenues resulted from a decrease in unit sales  partially offset by a increase in average selling prices primarily in the lc products introduced in the fourth fiscal quarter of revenues from sales of high energy physics products increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of unanticipated last time procurement from government laboratories 
the company believes that revenues from high energy physics products  which represented and  respectively  of product revenues excluding license fees in fiscal and  will likely represent a declining portion of future total revenues

other expense income  net increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest income expense  included in other expense income  net  was income of  in fiscal  compared with interest expense of  in fiscal this change was due primarily to an increased usage of cash for the purchase of capital equipment in fiscal as well as cash usage for purchased manufacturing and distribution rights and an investment in marketable equity securities of a strategic partner in the second half of fiscal substantially offsetting the increase in interest expense was a change in foreign exchange gains losses  from a loss of  in fiscal to a gain of  in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the unusually high effective tax rate in both fiscal and was due primarily to certain restructuring and other non recurring charges for which a tax benefit was not recorded

the remaining business of digitech will be discontinued 
accordingly  the results of the vigilant networks segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations and reported separately from continuing operations in all periods presented 
the company expects to break even on the sale and discontinuance of the vigilant networks segment 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at june   which represented a working capital ratio of to  compared to million  or to  at june  the reduction of the current ratio was due to the classification of the company s borrowings under its credit agreement to current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet see further discussion below 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the improvement in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to working capital reductions partially offset by lower operating earnings before restructuring and non recurring charges credits 
the increase in cash used by operations from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower operating earnings before restructuring and non recurring charges credits  substantially offset by a reduction in working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was  million and million  respectively

in addition  during fiscal  the company purchased manufacturing rights for complementary products from its strategic partner  iwatsu electric co  ltd 
iwatsu for million 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from fiscal to was primarily due to a million investment in the marketable equity securities of iwatsu made in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided in fiscal was primarily due to the issuance of preferred stock for gross proceeds of in fiscal the increase in cash provided by financing activities from fiscal to fiscal was due to the aforementioned issuance of preferred stock in fiscal and additional borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the company has a credit facility with two banks that expires on january  at march   primarily due to the losses incurred by its vigilant networks segment  the company violated certain financial covenants related to this credit facility 
in connection with the waiver of such violations and an amendment of covenants for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the maximum borrowings under the credit facility were reduced to million and the interest rate on outstanding borrowings increased to the higher of the prime rate  or the federal funds rate plus as defined  plus 
in addition  the credit facility is now comprised of a million revolving credit line and a million term loan  which is secured by a mortgage on the company s facility in chestnut ridge  new york 
the company has met its financial covenant requirements as of june  however  based on the company s projections  it appears likely that it will be in violation of certain of its financial covenants at the end of the first quarter of fiscal that were established as part of a september  amendment 
as such  outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of june  have been classified as a current liability 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events  in august the company raised gross proceeds of million in connection with a private placement of  shares of its common stock 
in addition  in august  the company sold its vigilant segment for million  before fees and retained liabilities 
the proceeds from these two transactions will be used to repay existing bank debt 
as of august   the company had cash balances of million and outstanding debt of million 
the company is currently evaluating financing opportunities with new lenders  which it expects will provide additional credit availability and financial flexibility 
the company believes that its cash on hand  together with the proceeds from the aforementioned private equity placement and sale of vigilant and cash flow generated by its continuing operations  will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to the above us based facility  the company maintains certain short term foreign credit facilities  principally facilities with two japanese banks totaling million yen million as of june  
no amounts were outstanding under such facilities as of june  risk management the company purchases materials from suppliers and sells its products around the world and maintains investments in foreign subsidiaries and securities  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  it is exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
among the more significant potential risks to the company of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the united states dollar  swiss franc and japanese yen  and  to a lesser extent  the german deutschemark  british pound  french franc  italian lira  korean won and the european monetary unit 
local currency expenses resulting from the worldwide sourcing of parts  components and sub assemblies are not generally offset by related local currency revenues  if any 
the company does not attempt to reduce its foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs or hedging transactions and has no plans to do so in the near term 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely effected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the united states dollar  the company s financial reporting currency  or otherwise 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for the company s products 
during the fiscal years ended june   and the company reported foreign currency exchange gains losses of   and  respectively 
the company s investment in the common stock of iwatsu  which is recorded in marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet  is subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in the japanese stock market 
in october  the company sold million shares of such stock reducing its exposure to these market risks 
as of june   japanese stock market and currency fluctuations resulted in a cumulative increase of approximately million to the remaining investment s original cost 
the change in the value of this investment  which is deemed temporary  is included as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet and  accordingly  not in net income or loss 
the company is also subject to market risk exposure through changes in interest rates on amounts payable under its bank credit facility 
at june   the company had million of bank debt outstanding under a million variable rate credit facility for which the interest rate at that date was 
assuming that principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional million in interest that year

in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  which for the company is effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sab  the company s policy has been to recognize license fee revenue when a non refundable fee was received and  from the company s perspective  all of its significant obligations under the license agreement were completed 
under sab  such license agreements are deemed to be multiple element agreements that  among other elements  include various exclusivity clauses 
in addition  sab requires such license fee agreements to be analyzed from the licensee s perspective as to the ongoing requirements or expectations of the agreements 
as such  under sab  certain of the company s previously recognized license fee revenue would be deferred and recognized in future periods over the term of the various agreements 
the company s preliminary estimate is that if sab was adopted as of june   it would result in a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and the establishment of deferred revenue of approximately million 
the company intends to adopt the provisions of sab in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value
