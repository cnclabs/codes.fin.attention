item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events in the fourth quarter  merry land properties  inc filed a registration statement with the sec describing a proposed distribution of rights to our existing stockholders which entitle our stockholders to purchase convertible trust preferred securities of merry land capital trust  a delaware business trust owned by merry land 
these securities will accrue distributions to their holders and will be convertible into merry land s common stock 
the company hopes to complete the securities offering during overview in  our income came primarily from three sources apartment rents net of rental and interest expense  million  mineral royalties  million  and property and development management fees  million 
since we have largely completed old merry land s development pipeline for equity residential properties trust in  development and management fees will drop sharply in in addition  one of our clay royalty agreements has expired  and this year s mineral royalties will total only about half of last year s amounts 
nevertheless  we do not anticipate a dramatic falloff in total operating income since we have been able to replace these sources of income in large part with rental income from six apartment communities we acquired during the year 
results of operations for the years ended december   and accounting predecessor 
while merry land has operated only since october   we are required to present financial statements for the years  and accordingly  only the consolidated balance sheets for december  and december  and the consolidated statement of income for the period ended december  are financial statements prepared for a real company 
all other consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income are for an accounting predecessor which have been constructed in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission as described in the notes to the financial statements 
rental operations all apartments 
at december   merry land owned eleven apartment communities  five of which were owned for all of and six of which were bought in august prior to the october spin off  old merry land owned all eleven of these communities 
the following table describes the operating performance of all eleven communities following the purchase of the six communities in august and the original five communities for periods prior to that 
dollars in thousands  except average monthly rent twelve months change from change to rental income     operating expenses     depreciation and amortization    total expenses     operating income     average occupancy average monthly rent expense ratio represents the average physical occupancy at each month end for the period held 
represents weighted average monthly rent charged for occupied units and rents asked for unoccupied units at december represents total operating expenses divided by rental revenues 
the purchase of six apartment communities in the third quarter of  which increased the weighted average number of apartment units owned to  in from  in  accounted for most of the increase in apartment income and the increase in expenses in these six communities contributed million in rental income  which was offset by million in operating expenses and thousand in depreciation  netting million of operating income during the increase in portfolio average rental rates in from resulted from higher rents at the company s continuing properties  but was offset somewhat by the lower rents charged at the communities the company acquired  whose monthly rents averaged at december  versus the continuing portfolio average of in rental income increased thousand  or  for the five apartment communities owned during that year because of higher rents and higher occupancy over expenses rose thousand  or  due primarily to increases in operating  maintenance and grounds  taxes and insurance expenses 
rental operations same store apartments 
the following table compares the performance of the  units which the company held for all of same store results to their performance in for months which they were owned by both merry land and old merry land dollars in thousands  except average monthly rent  see footnotes above twelve months change from change to rental income   personnel   utilities operating maintenance and grounds taxes and insurance depreciation and amortization   total expenses   operating income   average occupancy average monthly rent expense ratio for the year ended december   rental income increased thousand  or  for the five apartment communities because of higher rents over the same period in in the aggregate  the charleston and savannah rental markets were strong in both and as demand for apartments exceeded additions to supply 
charleston rents increased to  or  and savannah rents increased to  or  during this period 
the charleston apartment market will see significant additions to supply in  which may adversely affect occupancy and rent rates in that city 
we believe that physical occupancy should remain satisfactory despite these deliveries of new units if general economic activity  job growth and household formation remain strong 
total operating expenses excluding depreciation for the year were down thousand  or 
on site expenses  including personnel  operating  utilities  and maintenance expenses were down thousand as a result of aggressive expense control 
taxes and insurance increased thousand because of increases in assessed values  millage rates and higher insurance premiums 
rental operations commercial 
gross rental income for commercial properties decreased from by thousand  or  primarily as a result of reduced occupancy following our merger in the company owns six commercial properties in the augusta area containing a total of  square feet  including the office building where the company s headquarters are located 
three buildings containing approximately  square feet are located in the depressed downtown augusta rental market and are in varying stages of physical obsolescence 
consequently  occupancy for all six commercial properties was less than at december in gross rental income rose by thousand  or  for commercial properties because of increased occupancy 
total expenses were up thousand  or  in primarily due to higher utilities and maintenance expenses resulting from higher occupancy 
land 
the company owns approximately  acres of unimproved land  of which  acres are subject to clay and sand mining leases 
land income decreased to million in from million in the expiration of one of the royalty agreements caused a thousand decrease in clay royalty income 
this was partially offset by the thousand increase in timber sales 
mortgage interest income 
interest income from mortgage notes receivable totaled thousand in  down from thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
this decrease resulted from the repayment of outstanding obligations in property management and development fees 
management fee income increased to thousand in from thousand in development fee income increased to million from thousand 
these increases are the result of the company receiving no development and management fees prior to its being spun off in october with the exception of a thousand development fee in from godley station  a third party development contract in savannah  these fees were earned under agreements with equity residential under which the company provided property management and development consulting services for twelve equity residential apartment communities that had been owned by old merry land 
six of these were stabilized communities whose outstanding ownership interests were acquired by merry land in the remaining six communities were either under lease up or development and are currently owned by equity residential 
at december   the property management assignments with equity residential had been completed  while approximately thousand remains to be earned under the development agreement 
the company intends to seek other third party property management and development consulting business  but we expect fee income to decline substantially in coming quarters 
interest expense 
the assets contributed to the company by old merry land were not encumbered by mortgage debt at any time prior to the spin off in therefore  the financial statements for the accounting predecessor to merry land for periods prior to the spin off assume that there was no debt or related interest expense 
in october and in connection with the spin off  the company received its assets subject to million of senior debt  million of subordinated debt  and million of preferred stock 
interest expense related to these obligations totaled thousand in  all accrued after the spin off and included thousand of dividends accrued on the company s preferred stock 
during this period  the average rate on the senior debt was and the rate on the subordinated debt and preferred stock was 
these obligations were repaid in june interest expense related to these obligations totaled million for the twelve months ended december  and included thousand of dividends accrued on the company s preferred stock 
interest expense related to the million mortgage loans closed in june   and the million mortgage loans closed in august   totaled million and million  respectively 
interest on the company s line of credit totaled thousand 
interest capitalized related to development in progress was thousand in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in and thousand for the period october  to december  for periods prior to the spin off  management has estimated common and corporate level expenses which might have been incurred on behalf of the accounting predecessor to merry land by old merry land in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission applicable for subsidiaries which have been spun off 
management has allocated such expenses based on their best estimate under these guidelines of time and effort that would have been expended for the benefit of the accounting predecessor 
impairment charge 
in conjunction with the likely disposition of several of our commercial properties  the company wrote down the carrying cost of several of these assets to their estimated value as determined in the company s formation and startup 
this produced a pretax charge in of million 
income before taxes and extraordinary item 
income before taxes and extraordinary item decreased to million in from million in and million in as discussed in note to the financial statements  general and administrative expenses estimated in the statements were considerably less prior to the spin off than after the spin off and there was no interest expense incurred prior to the spin off 
the decrease in income before taxes and extraordinary item in from was primarily related to the higher general and administrative expense of million and higher interest expense of million  partially offset by higher net rental income primarily from an increase in the number of apartments owned and by higher development and management fees from the agreements with equity residential 
the decrease in income before taxes in from related to the higher general and administrative expense of thousand  higher interest expense of thousand  and the million impairment charge 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by increases in mineral royalties and fee income from third party property management and development consulting 
income taxes 
as a reit  the accounting predecessor to merry land was not subject to income taxes 
the income tax expense for the twelve month period ended december  was million  which included a thousand net income tax provision on the discount on repayment of the subordinated debt 
the expense consisted of thousand in current income tax benefit and million in deferred income tax expense 
a net income tax benefit in related to the period from october  to december  totaled thousand  and consisted of thousand in current income tax expense and thousand in deferred income tax benefit 
the deferred income tax benefit arose primarily from the book and tax timing differences 
discount on repayment of debt and on redemption of preferred stock 
in june we closed million in mortgage financing and the proceeds were used to repay the senior debt  subordinated debt and preferred stock that were issued in connection with the merger and spin off 
there was an extraordinary gain from the discount on the repayment of subordinated debt of thousand  net of income taxes of thousand 
the discount on redemption of the preferred stock was million 
funds from operations 
funds from operations were million for the twelve month period ended december  and were thousand from october  to december   the period in that the company operated as an independent public entity 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations 
data in thousands january  oct  to to december  dec  net income loss available for common  add depreciation of operating real estate owned  add discount on receivable redemption add impairment charge  add tax benefit expense resulting from permanent difference in book and tax basis less extraordinary gain less discount on redemption of preferred stock  funds from operations available to common shares  weighted average common shares outstanding basic   diluted   the company believes that funds from operations are an important measure of its operating performance 
funds from operations do not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  or as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or as a measure of the company s liquidity 
the company defines funds from operations as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding all non recurring items and net realized gains losses  plus depreciation of operating real estate 
projects under development 
the company owns a acre tract adjacent to its quarterdeck apartments in charleston on which it expects to begin construction in march of merritt at james island  a unit apartment community 
the million projected cost is expected to be funded with non recourse financing 
the first units are expected to be available for rental in fall in the company acquired a historic building in downtown charleston which we are currently renovating into seven condominium units for sale to the public 
the building cost thousand and the total estimated costs of renovation are thousand 
we expect to realize income from the sale of the condominiums in we are pursuing the development of a acre tract adjacent to our waters edge community that lies along the ashley river in the summerville area of charleston for up to nine single family lots 
we are in the process of obtaining zoning and regulatory approvals and if successful  we will spend approximately thousand on road and infrastructure and then begin marketing the lots for sale 
we are evaluating the feasibility of establishing a wetland mitigation bank on a portion of the merry tract located in augusta 
if successful in establishing the bank  we would be accorded credits for preserving  creating or enhancing wetlands and these credits could be sold to others who have destroyed wetlands elsewhere 
while we believe our prospects for establishing a bank are good  there seems to be a limited demand for credits in our local service area 
demand may limit the feasibility of this venture 
liquidity and capital resources financial structure at december   total debt equaled of total capitalization at cost and of total capitalization with equity valued at market  shares outstanding at the december  closing price of per share 
at december   the company s financial structure was as follows dollars in thousands equity at book of total market value of total line of credit   mortgage loans   total debt   common stock   total capitalization   eleven separate wholly owned limited liability companies own our eleven apartment communities 
the existing mortgage financing restricts any of the limitedliability companies from making loans to the company and distributions from each limited liability company may be restricted because of loan requirements to maintain adequate capitalization 
each limited liability company is a separate legal entity and its assets are not available to pay the debts of the company and its liabilities do not constitute obligations of the company 
in june  the company closed million in mortgage financing with five non recourse loans secured by five apartment communities in charleston and savannah 
the proceeds were used to repay the senior debt  subordinated debt and preferred stock that were issued in connection with the merger and spin off 
the five loans have year terms  bearing interest at and are secured by five of the company s apartment communities 
in addition  the company obtained at the time of the mortgage refinancing a million unsecured line of credit that bear interest at libor plus 
in august  the company obtained million in additional mortgage financing and million against our line of credit to purchase the remaining interests held by equity residential in the six limited liability companies which owned six other apartment communities that had been owned by our predecessor 
these six non recourse loans have eight to twelve year terms and bear interest at for the eight year term loans and for the twelve year term loans 
liquidity 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements with working capital  cash provided by operating activities  construction loans and a line of credit which we have established with a commercial bank 
our primary short term liquidity needs are operating expenses  capital improvements  the proposed development of the merritt at james island community  the condominium conversion of the calhoun street apartments  and the waters edge land development 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements from a variety of sources including operating cash flow  additional mortgage loans and other borrowings  and the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities in public and private markets 
our long term liquidity needs include the maturity of mortgage debt and the financing of acquisitions and development 
the proceeds from the convertible trust preferred securities offering will be used to repay the outstanding balance under the line of credit and for general corporate purposes  including capital improvements to our existing properties  the acquisition of additional apartment communities  and the development and construction of new apartment communities 
cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million on december   a decrease of thousand from december  the million net cash provided from operating activities was offset primarily by million used to acquire the ownership interests in the six apartment communities owned by equity residential  thousand to acquire the calhoun street apartments and million for repairs  replacements and improvements on the residential communities 
in addition  thousand received from the repayment of mortgage notes receivable was offset by the million lent to the employee stock ownership plan 
year disclosure 
the year problem existed because many computer programs used only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs might have recognized the year as the year it was feared by some that this could have resulted in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of normal business operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions or collect rents 
this did not occur 
the company did not experience any material disruption of operations 
the contingency plans we had in place in the event of unanticipated equipment and systems failures were not required to be implemented 
inflation 
substantially all of the company s leases are for terms of one year or less  which should enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher rent rates in times of rising prices 
the company believes that this would offset the effect of cost increases stemming from inflation
