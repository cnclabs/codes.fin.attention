overview insite vision is developing genetically based tools for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma and ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on its proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology 
the company is collaborating with academic researchers to develop new diagnostic  prognostic and management tools for primary congenital  juvenile and primary open angle glaucomas 
primary congenital glaucoma is an inherited eye disorder and is one of the leading causes of blindness and visual impairment affecting infants 
a gene based diagnostic kit may allow early detection of the disease before considerable irreversible damage has occurred and may improve the ability to treat it successfully 
primary open angle glaucoma usually affects people over the age of forty 
current glaucoma tests are generally unable to detect the disease before substantial damage to the optic nerve has occurred 
gene based tests may make it possible to identify patients at risk and initiate treatment before permanent optic nerve damage and vision loss occurs 
the company has international and national collaborations with academic institutions for the identification and clinical evaluation of genetic markers for glaucoma 
to date  the company s academic collaborators at ucsf and uchc have identified genes associated with primary open angle glaucoma the most prevalent form of the disease in adults  juvenile glaucoma and primary congenital glaucoma 
a diagnostic prognostic technology  isv  which is capable of identifying multiple glaucoma genetic markers from a single sample  has been developed and  in november  the company licensed the technology to p u 
see collaborative and licensing agreements for additional information on the agreement 
another result of the glaucoma genetics research has been the development of the isv product candidate 
this durasite formulation contains a drug that has been shown in cell and organ culture systems to inhibit the production of a protein that appears to cause glaucoma 
in january  the company entered into a transaction that granted p u an exclusive worldwide license for isv for the treatment of glaucoma 
see collaborative and licensing agreements for additional discussion of the transaction 
in june  the company announced positive results from its phase ii trial of isv p u has assumed the continued development of the product with the continued technical support of the company 
the durasite delivery system is a patented eyedrop formulation comprising a cross linked carboxyl containing polymer which incorporates the drug to be delivered to the eye 
the formulation is instilled in the cul de sac of the eye as a small volume eyedrop 
durasite can be customized to deliver a wide variety of potential drug candidates with a broad range of molecular weights and other properties 
the durasite formulation remains in the eye for up to several hours during which time the active drug ingredient is gradually released 
durasite extends the residence time of the drug due to a combination of mucoadhesion  surface tension and viscosity 
eyedrops delivered in the durasite system contrast to conventional eyedrops which typically only last in the eye a few minutes  thus requiring delivery of a highly concentrated burst of drug and frequent administration to sustain therapeutic levels 
the increased residence time for durasite is designed to permit lower concentrations of a drug to be administered over a longer period of time  thereby minimizing the inconvenience of frequent dosing and reducing the potential related adverse side effects 
the company is focusing its research and development on i expansion of the isv technology for the prognosis  diagnosis and management of glaucoma  ii providing on going technical support to p u for isv for the treatment of inflammation and the prevention and treatment of glaucoma  iii isv for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration  iv isv a retinal drug delivery device  and v evaluation and development of several antibiotics not currently used in ophthalmics 
to date  insite vision has not received any revenues from the sale of products  although it has received a small amount of royalties from the sale of products using the company s licensed technology 
until  the company had been unprofitable since its inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of its product candidates 
the company has financed its research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placement of its equity securities and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements 
on january   the company entered into a license agreement and stock purchase agreement pursuant to which insite granted p u an exclusive worldwide license to isv for the treatment of glaucoma 
the license called for i p u to assume responsibility for the development of the product upon completion by insite of  among other activities  phase ii studies completed by the company  ii p u to reimburse insite for research and development expenses and to make payments to insite for on going technical support  and iii the payment by p u to insite of royalties on product sales should isv be successfully commercialized 
insite will continue to bear responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of the patents subject to the license  among other things 
the transaction also called for equity investments from p u of  for which they received  shares of common stock  with the potential for future equity investments at an average of prevailing market prices if the company achieves certain milestones 
on november   the company entered into a license agreement  stock purchase agreement and credit agreement pursuant to which insite granted p u an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license to its isv technology for diagnostic  prognostic and therapeutic applications in the area of glaucoma 
the license calls for i p u to pay the company a million licensing fee  ii p u to make up to million in research and development payments to the company over three years starting in  iii p u to pay the company royalties on product sales should any products be successfully commercialized from this technology  and iv the potential for payments of up to million by p u to the company based on achievement of certain milestones 
the stock purchase agreement provided for a million equity investment by p u in the company 
a total of  shares were purchased in january  days after the execution of the agreement 
the stock purchase agreement also provides for a standstill period of thirty months during which p u and its subsidiaries will not purchase additional shares of the company  other than those provided for under any existing agreements between the companies  without the prior written consent of the company 
this standstill period will terminate earlier if certain actions are taken by other parties to acquire more than a interest in the stock of the company or if any other party announces their intention to assume control of the company  whether by tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit to be made available to the company on november  for a period of three years 
any amounts drawn on the line will bear interest at a rate of three percent over the prime rate announced at the time of borrowing by chase manhattan bank in new york city 
at the company s discretion  repayments on the line may be made in cash at any point  or the total amount due at the end of the loan period may be paid by issuance of the company s stock at a twenty five percent premium to the average market price of the company s stock for a period prior to the end of the loan 
the loan provides for certain affirmative and negative covenants as well as other terms and conditions 
in august  the company entered into a license agreement with ssp co  inc  a japanese company  to be the exclusive manufacturer and distributor of aquasite in japan 
aquasite is an over the counter product which uses the company s durasite technology and demulcents for the symptomatic treatment of dry eye 
under this agreement  the company received a net amount of  for materials provided to ssp during in march  the company entered into a royalty bearing license agreement with global damon  a korean company  to be the exclusive distributor of aquasite in the republic of korea 
concurrently  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement with kukje  a korean company  to produce the aquasite to be sold by global damon 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
there can be no assurance that insite vision will ever achieve or be able to maintain either significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
results of operations the company had total net revenues of million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to was attributable to the license fee received from p u in the company earned royalty income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from sales of aquasite by ciba vision 
to date  the company has not relied on royalty revenues to fund its activities  nor has it received revenues from the sale of products 
research and development expenses  net  decreased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in the decrease in was primarily due to expense recovery from p u of million related to the isv project 
additionally  compensation and related costs decreased due to a reduction in r d headcount which occurred in november the decrease in was primarily due to lower expenditures for outside services  consultants and compensation related costs due to a reduction in r d headcount 
the reduction in outside service costs mainly reflects the completion of development activities for isv and transfer of the project to b l  the company s joint development partner on that project 
general and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in and decreased during from million in the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to lower personnel related and facility costs 
the lower facility cost reflected the sublease of a portion of unused office space beginning in january the sublease term is consistent with the base lease which is through the decrease in as compared to was primarily related to the reduced cost of directors and officers insurance  lower consulting expenses and lower costs related to the hiring of full time personnel in the area of accounting and finance 
net interest and other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations are due principally to changes in average cash balances 
interest earned in the future will be dependent on the company s funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
interest expense in related to notes payable which were paid off during the first quarter of the company had net income for the year ended december  of million and incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net income in is mainly the result of licensing revenue of million and cost reimbursement of million received from p u for the isv and isv projects  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources through  insite vision financed its operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock totaling approximately million and an october initial public offering of common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
after  the company financed its operations primarily through a january private placement of common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately million and an april public offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in accordance with a july agreement between the company and b l  the company received a total of million from the sale of common stock in august and in september  the company completed a million private placement of  shares of redeemable convertible series a preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  the company entered into a transaction with p u from which the company received a total of million from the sale of common stock in january and september 
in november  the company entered into another transaction with p u from which the company received a million licensing fee and  in january  received million from the sale of  shares of common stock 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
it is the company s policy to invest these funds in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities  less cash used to acquire capital equipment  was million and for the years ended december  and  cash used for operating activities and additions to capital equipment was million and million  respectively 
of those amounts    and  were for additions to laboratory and other property and equipment in  and  respectively 
in   of the additional expenditures related to the company s portion of improvements at b l s facilities in tampa  florida 
in  the company sold the equipment and improvements at the tampa facility to b l for  which resulted in a loss on the sale of  in  the company had recognized an impairment in the value of this equipment of  this also resulted in a decrease in  in both laboratory and other equipment and accumulated depreciation of  the company s future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in the company s existing collaborative and licensing relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative arrangements  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  the timing of additional product development and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
starting in  the company wrote off its fully depreciated assets 
this resulted in a decrease in both property and equipment and accumulated depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively  with no change in net property and equipment 
the company anticipates no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on the company s good environmental compliance record to date  and its current compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  in combination with the cash the company has received and will receive during as part of the isv and isv licensing transactions with p u  will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses and cash requirements through insite vision may require substantial additional funds prior to reaching sustained profitability  and the company may seek private or public equity investments  future collaborative agreements  and possibly research funding to meet such needs 
even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash  it may seek access to the private or public equity markets if and when it believes conditions are favorable 
there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the company to finance its operations on acceptable terms  or at all 
year the year yk issue was the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
it was anticipated that such computer systems would be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company implemented a program to assess its exposure from yk related failures in its internal systems 
prior to december   the company had determined that the majority of the company s significant operating and accounting systems were yk compliant 
the company did not encounter any system failures or other computer errors related to a yk issue and did not suffer any interruption in service from its suppliers or vendors 
the company has incurred less than  in expense to upgrade or replace non compliant computer programs or hardware 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s eventual yk related costs will not exceed this amount 
while the company does not have a comprehensive program for monitoring whether its suppliers and vendors systems were or are yk compliant  it does not believe that non compliance by and single source provider would have a material impact on its operations 
the company does not expect its financial condition or results of operations to be materially adversely affected by yk issues 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company invests its excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   the company had million invested in money market mutual funds 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material
