item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared with sales increased for the ninth consecutive year  as sales at million were up from levels 
the major contributor was plymouth tapes  where sales of million were up from increased capacity in the canton plant allowed the company to meet increasing customer demand 
sales in the automotive market were particularly strong  as sales increased from levels and accounted for most of the growth 
sales in all other markets increased  as increases in domestic markets were mostly offset by weakness in markets outside the us brite line technologies also contributed to growth  as sales of million were up over gross margin increased to from last year 
plymouth tapes gross margin increased to from last year 
the major factor in the improvement was higher production volume in the canton operations to meet increased sales demand and build inventories 
this was partially offset by higher raw material purchase prices and higher levels of manufacturing spending 
brite line technologies gross margin increased to from last year  due to better pricing and higher volume  partially offset by higher manufacturing spending and raw material usage 
selling  general and administrative expenses are incurred and recorded in both plymouth tapes and brite line technologies 
certain of the selling  general and administrative expenses recorded in plymouth tapes could be considered as incurred for the benefit of brite line  but are currently not allocated to that segment 
these expenses include certain management  accounting  personnel and sales services  and a limited amount of travel  insurance  directors fees and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to from last year 
the major source of the increase was brite line technologies  where selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to from last year 
the major factor was an increase in professional fees to  from  last year  to cover the majority of the costs associated with a patent infringement lawsuit 
salaries in brite line technologies also increased by approximately  because of higher accrued bonuses and an additional sales resource 
offsetting these increases  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  in plymouth tapes decreased slightly to from last year 
the major factors were improved bad debt cost and lower professional fees  offset in part by higher freight and outside warehouse costs 
operating income for also included an insurance settlement with one of the company s previous liability insurance carriers 
under the terms of the agreement  the insurance carrier made a one time payment of  in exchange for a release of all past  present  and future environmental claims 
interest expense increased to  from  last year 
the increase occurred largely in the first half of  due to increased long term borrowings to finance capital investments  as well as higher balances on the revolving line of credit  to finance operations and some capital improvements 
during the second half of  interest expense was approximately level with last year 
although the average second half borrowing balances for both long term debt and the revolving line of credit were higher in compared to last year  the interest rates applied to the revolving line of credit and the real estate portion of the long term debt were lower in compared to last year 
the lower interest rates were a result of a new loan agreement with plymouth s primary lender  effective june  as a result of the above factors  income before tax increased to  from  last year 
excluding the one time insurance settlement  income before tax increased 
the effective tax rate in increased to from last year 
the major factor in the difference occurred during  which benefited from investment tax credits generated by the more than million of capital equipment placed in service during that year 
as a result  net income increased to  from  last year 
excluding the one time insurance settlement  net income increased  based upon the effective tax rate 
cash generated from operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the major factors contributing to cash from operating activities include net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and deferred income tax expense of million  partially offset by a million increase in inventory 
inventory was increased to better respond to customer demand in plymouth tapes  prepare for certain canton plant equipment installations during the first quarter of fiscal  and to support higher levels of activity in brite line technologies 
the operating cash flow and cash provided through additional borrowings totaling million under the company s revolving line of credit  million under a capital expenditure line of credit  and million from sale leaseback of equipment  were used to finance capital expenditures of million  pay off or reduce term debt and capital leases of million  and repurchase plymouth rubber common stock in the amount of million 
the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from currency transactions are included in income currently 
the company operates a wholly owned subsidiary in spain which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the functional currency of this subsidiary is the peseta 
changes in the peseta exchange rate could affect the reporting of the subsidiary s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
from time to time  the us company enters into purchase or sales contracts in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s practice is to hedge those transactions which are of significant size 
compared with sales increased for the eighth consecutive year  as sales at million were up from levels 
the major contributor was brite line technologies  where sales increased by million from  reflecting increased business from both new and existing customers 
sales in plymouth tapes produced in canton  mass  and porrino  spain decreased by million and  from primarily because of capacity constraints  product mix  and because of reduced demand due to the general motors strike 
gross margin in increased to from in in plymouth tapes  gross margin in improved to from in the primary factor was lower product costs  resulting from lower purchase costs for resin and other raw materials  and lower manufacturing spending  offset in part by higher unfavorable volume variances 
gross margin in at brite line technologies decreased to from in  reflecting higher production costs and an increase in inventory reserves  offset in part by favorable manufacturing overhead absorption from higher production levels  and by favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses in  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in the major source of the decrease was brite line technologies  where selling  general and administration expenses  as a percentage of sales decreased to from in the major factor was the ability of brite line to have a large increase in sales of without adding substantially to the selling  general and administrative expenses  which had a relatively small increase of 
partially offsetting these decreases  selling  general and administrative expenses  as percentage of sales in plymouth tapes  increased to from in the major contributing factors were higher accrued bonus  profit sharing  professional fees  and bad debt expense 
interest expense in  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in higher interest expense resulted from an increase in current and long term debt to million from million in  in order to finance capital equipment purchases 
in addition  the revolving line of credit increased to million at november   from million in  in order to finance higher accounts receivable  resulting from a million sales increase in the fourth quarter of from the same period in  some capital equipment purchases  and a small increase in inventory 
as a result of the above factors  income before tax increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate in decreased to from in  resulting from investment tax credits generated by the more than million of capital equipment placed in service during the year 
as a result  net income in increased to million from million in the company generated million of operating cash flow in this operating cash flow  cash provided through additional borrowings totaling million under the company s line of credit  a refinancing of capital equipment and a capital expenditure line of credit of million  and the sale leaseback of plant assets of million  were used to pay off or reduce term debt and capital leases of million and to finance capital expenditures of million 
liquidity and capital resources during   and  plymouth rubber invested in a significant capital expansion and improvement program  for a total amount of million  including a new calender and coating line  and associated equipment  which substantially increased its production capacity 
at the end of fiscal and the beginning of  the company also invested in new subsidiaries brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa  which it considers to be strategic opportunities 
in connection with these investments and to support sales growth of approximately million or from to  the company has increased its debt from approximately million in to approximately million in the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of december  based upon current projections  the company believes it will meet these covenants during as of december   the company had approximately million of unused borrowing capacity under its million line of credit with its primary lender  after consideration of collateral limitations and the letter of credit related to a guarantee of million pesetas approximately million on a term loan agreement with a spanish bank syndicate 
in the opinion of management  anticipated cash flow from operations  unused capacity under existing borrowing agreements  and additional funds generated from a capital expenditure line of credit and or the sale leaseback of capital equipment  will provide sufficient funds to meet expected needs during fiscal  including necessary working capital expansion to support anticipated revenue growth and investments in capital equipment  and to service its indebtedness 
although management expects to be able to accomplish its plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
failure to accomplish theses plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and financial position 
environmental proceedings claims under cercla the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp by the united states environmental protection agency epa in two ongoing claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
these cercla claims involve attempts by the epa to recover the costs associated with the cleanup of two superfund sites in southington  connecticut the solvent recovery service of new england superfund site srs site and the old southington landfill superfund site osl site 
srs was an independent and licensed solvent recycler disposal company 
the epa asserts that srs  after receiving and processing various hazardous substances from prps  shipped some resultant sludges and wastewater from the srs site to the osl site 
the company received a prp notification regarding the srs site in june  the epa originally attributed a share of the aggregate waste volume at the srs site to the company 
remedial action is ongoing at the site  and the company is a participant in the performing prp group 
largely because of orphaned shares  the company recently has been contributing approximately toward the performing prp group s expenses 
based upon the investigations and remedial actions conducted at the site to date  including a phytoremediation study  it is presently estimated that the total cost of the cleanup at the site will range from approximately million to million 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december   management has accrued  as a reserve in this matter which is net of approximately  in payments made to date by the company 
the company received a prp notification regarding the osl site in january  in addition to numerous srs transshipper prps such as the company  epa has named a number of other prps who allegedly shipped waste materials directly to the osl site 
based on epa s asserted volume of shipments to srs  epa originally attributed of the srs transshipper prps waste volume at the osl site to the company  which is a fraction of the undetermined total waste volume at the site 
a record of decision rod was issued in september  for the first phase of the cleanup and  in december   following mediation  the company contributed  toward a total contribution by the srs transshipper prps of approximately million in full settlement of the first phase 
at present  neither the remedy for the second phase of the cleanup groundwater nor the allocation of the costs thereof among the prps has been determined 
it has been estimated that the total costs of the second phase may range from million to million 
management has accrued  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a reserve against the company s potential future liability in this matter 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes that its accruals in these two matters are reasonable 
however  in each case the reserved amount is subject to adjustment for future developments that may arise from one or more of the following the long range nature of the case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate groundwater remedy selected  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
claims under massachusetts general laws  chapter e while in the process of eliminating the use of underground storage tanks at the company s facility in canton  massachusetts  the company arranged for the testing of the areas adjacent to the tanks in question a set of five tanks in and a set of three tanks in the tests indicated that some localized soil contamination had occurred 
the company duly reported these findings regarding each location to the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep in and respectively  and dep issued notices of responsibility under massachusetts general laws chapter e to the company for each location rtn no 
and rtn no 
 respectively 
the company has retained an independent licensed site professional lsp to perform assessment and remediation work at the two locations 
with regard to the first matter involving the set of five tanks  the lsp has determined that the soil contamination appears to be confined to a small area and does not pose an environmental risk to surrounding property or community 
with regard to the second matter involving the set of three tanks  a limited amount of solvent has been found in the soil in the vicinity of the tanks  however  additional sampling is required 
it presently is estimated that the combined future costs to complete the assessment and remediation actions at the two locations will total approximately  and that amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
in january  the company received a chapter e notice of responsibility from dep concerning two sites located in dartmouth  massachusetts rtn no 
and freetown  massachusetts rtn no 
 respectively 
according to dep  drums containing oil and or hazardous materials were discovered at the two sites in  which led to some cleanup actions by the dep 
dep contends that an independent disposal firm allegedly hired by the company and other prps  h m drum company  was responsible for disposing of drums at the two sites 
to date  the dep has issued notices of responsibility to approximately prps 
a group of prps  including the company  has retained an lsp to conduct subsurface investigations at both sites 
the lsp recently completed limited subsurface investigations at both sites 
at the freetown site  no reportable contamination was found either in soil or groundwater  and the lsp has recommended that dep close the site out 
at the dartmouth site  no reportable contamination was found in soil  while reportable  but lower than historical levels of contaminants were found in groundwater 
the lsp s investigation at the dartmouth site further indicates that there may be an upgradient off site source of contaminants that is impacting the site  and recommends further investigation into that possibility 
while the results of the limited subsurface investigations at these sites are relatively encouraging  until additional data is gathered  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs of any further investigation or cleanup that may be required at either or both sites  or the company s potential share of liability or responsibility therefor 
accordingly  no reserve has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these two sites 
other litigation the company s subsidiary  brite line technologies  inc  was both a defendant and a counterclaim plaintiff in a patent infringement lawsuit initiated in in federal district court in minnesota and settled in february  the suit involved contrasting claims by brite line and the plaintiff a competitor of brite line in the highway marking tapes business  that the other party had committed patent infringement with respect to its specialty retroreflective pavement marking tapes containing raised wedges 
the only brite line products at issue in the case have generated limited sales to date that have not been material to the company or to the brite line subsidiary 
after the completion of discovery and prior to trial  both parties agreed to resolve the suit amicably 
under the terms of the settlement  which required no payment of damages by either party  the parties agreed to accept certain interpretations of the plaintiff s patent claims and neither party admitted infringing the patent rights of the other 
brite line agreed not to manufacture or sell any product which conflicts with the plaintiff s patent claims and to discontinue its counterclaim against the plaintiff 
the company s earnings  competitive position and capital expenditures are not expected to be materially adversely affected by the settlement 
year computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors that use only two digits to identify a year in a data field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company assembled a task force to oversee the entire year project  which included the company s domestic and foreign tape business and brite line  for both information technology it and non it systems 
the company believed that its greatest potential risks were associated with its it systems and non it systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure 
the task force identified five phases of the year compliance process for the company s it and non it systems 
these phases were issue identification  assessment  development of remediation plans  implementation and testing and contingency planning 
these five phases were completed 
with respect to it systems  the company s strategy was to upgrade its mission critical main information systems hardware and software and other support software  and to replace a group of manufacturing support software 
regarding the upgrade of the main information systems hardware and software and other support software  the implementation and testing phase was complete as of april  regarding the replacement of a group of manufacturing support software  the implementation and testing phase was complete as of october with respect to non it systems  the implementation phase was complete as of december large and critical suppliers were selected for compliance confirmation  responses were received and no critical problems were identified 
separately  the company actively sought information and assurances of a more technical nature from certain vendors regarding the compliance status of specific manufacturing and information processing equipment 
in addition to confirming compliance directly with suppliers and vendors  the company performed its own testing of certain purchased equipment and information processing equipment for compliance 
the company monitored the status of year compliance of its most significant customers through direct contact  written confirmation  and by reviewing publicly available information 
the company developed a contingency plan for both it and non it systems  as appropriate 
the contingency plan included building additional inventories in case of vendor supply or power interruptions  using alternate suppliers  outsourcing to third parties  utilizing alternative software  and reverting to manual processing of information 
costs incurred to date for year have totaled approximately  and have been expensed as incurred 
costs included internal employee costs and costs of external consultants  and were funded through operating cash flows 
the company believes there was no material adverse impact of such costs on its long term results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
if the company had not taken any of the remedial steps detailed above  year issues would possibly have caused significant technological problems for the company  disrupting business  potentially resulting in increased costs and or loss of business 
at this time  no technological problems have occurred 
the worst case scenario had the company  its customers or suppliers been unable to adequately resolve year issues  would have included a temporary slowdown or abrupt stoppage of operations at one or more of the company s facilities due to the failure of one or more critical processes or business systems 
such failures could have resulted in interruptions in manufacturing  safety and or environmental systems  and or a temporary inability to receive raw materials  ship finished products and process orders and invoices 
if such or similar scenarios had occurred  they could  depending on their duration  have had a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
such theoretical consequences are of a kind and magnitude generally shared with other manufacturing companies 
at this time  no significant year disruptions have occurred 
the company will continue to monitor its it and non it systems for any possible year issues 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas will require the company to record derivative instruments  such as foreign currency hedges  on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
currently  the company treats such instruments as off balance sheet items 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the specific use of each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment as stated in the standard 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued fas accounting for derivative and similar financial instruments and for hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fas fas changed the effective date for implementation of fas fas will be effective for the company on december   the beginning of fiscal year the company currently does not expect the impact of adopting fas to be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the carrying value of company s debt totaled million which approximated its fair value 
this debt includes amounts at both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt by approximately  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant
