item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk introduction old national bancorp old national is a bank holding company headquartered in evansville  indiana 
located in indiana  illinois  and kentucky  its community banking locations serve customers in both urban and rural markets 
these community banking centers provide a wide range of financial services  such as making commercial and consumer loans  originating and servicing mortgage loans  issuing and servicing credit cards  leasing  offering various deposit products  issuing letters of credit  issuing credit life  accident  and health insurance  providing safe deposit facilities  and providing alternative investments and brokerage services 
old national s nonbank affiliates provide additional financial or support services incidental to old national s operations  including issuance and reinsurance of credit life  accident  health  life  property  and casualty insurance  investment services  fiduciary and trust services  and property ownership 
financial basis the following discussion is an analysis of old national s operating results for the years through and financial condition as of december  and  and will assist readers of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page management s forward looking statements are intended to benefit the reader but are subject to various risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to economic conditions generally and in the market areas of the company  increased competition in the financial services industry  actions by the federal reserve board and changes in interest rates  and governmental legislation and regulation 
the financial information has been restated to reflect mergers accounted for as pooling of interests as if they had occurred at the beginning of the first year presented 
purchases have been included in reported results from the date of the transaction 
during  old national sold the operations and related auto loans of its consumer finance subsidiary headquartered in indianapolis 
the sale and the operations prior to the sale resulted in a million loss on discontinued operations  net of tax  in in certain contingencies related to this sale were successfully resolved and resulted in a million gain on discontinued operations 
the financial results of the discontinued operations in prior periods are similarly broken out from old national s continuing operations 
the net assets of the subsidiary are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet for periods prior to the sale 
the following discussion and analysis of old national s financial condition and results of operations relate to its continuing operations 
for further details regarding the discontinued operations  see the consolidated financial statements and note tax exempt interest income in the following information has been increased to an amount comparable to interest subject to income taxes using the federal statutory rate in effect of for all periods 
an offsetting increase of the same amount is made in the income tax section of the selected financial data 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments 
competition and economic conditions the banking industry and related financial service providers are highly competitive 
old national competes not only against other local and regional banking institutions  thrifts  finance companies  and credit unions  but also money market mutual funds  investment brokers  and insurance companies 
this competition takes place in terms of interest rates on loans and deposits  convenient locations and hours  types of services  and quality of service 
in most of its markets  old national ranks first or second in volume of loans and deposits 
the economy in the united states and the midwest has continued their relatively low inflation and unemployment and steady growth 
while there have been some conflicting signs of weakness in certain sectors of the economy  old national s major markets have generally demonstrated economic expansion and a growing financial base with additions such as the new and expanding toyota and ak steel manufacturing complexes 
short and long term interest rates increased during the second half of  reversing the declines of the federal funds rate target established by the federal reserve open market committee was increased from in june of to by december the national prime lending rate moved in tandem with the federal funds target rate  increasing from to during long term us treasury rates increased throughout the year us treasury bond yield finished the year at  approximately basis points higher than in january the yield curve  as measured by the difference between rates on month us treasury bills and year treasury bonds  steepened during from a fairly flat curve in  reflecting continuing concern within the financial markets that interest rates would increase further 
during  the fixed income market began requiring from corporate customers higher spreads to us treasury rates 
in and  declining rates muted some of this impact on the banking industry s and old national s cost of funds 
with the rising rate environment in  this additional spread put pressure on the marginal cost of funds 
this trend combined with competitive issues on loan pricing continued to compress net interest margin in within the banking industry and at old national 
merger and consolidation activity during  old national merged with southern bancshares ltd 
southern  carbondale  illinois  and dulaney bancorp  inc dulaney  marshall  illinois 
as of december   southern had total assets of million  and dulaney s total assets were million 
both mergers were consummated in the first quarter of and accounted for as pooling of interests 
these financial statements have been restated to reflect the southern merger 
the dulaney merger was not considered material 
in old national announced merger agreements with anb corporation anb  muncie  indiana  heritage financial services  inc heritage  clarksville  tennessee  and permanent bancorp  inc permanent  evansville  indiana 
as of december   total assets for these entities were million for anb  million for heritage  and million for permanent 
anb and heritage mergers are anticipated to close in the first quarter of and will be accounted for as pooling of interests 
the permanent transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of and will be accounted for as a purchase 
these mergers are subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals 
in old national implemented its charter consolidation project named one bank 
in the third and fourth quarters old national consolidated its banking charters down to three banks with the ultimate plan to have one banking charter 
the goals of one bank included a single brand image  common products offered throughout the banking locations  and improved back office efficiency 
year old national and its computer systems and software successfully made the transition into the year the media devoted much coverage to the year yk issue  also know as the millennium bug 
this refers to the possibility that some computers may be unable to recognize the date change at the turn of the century 
with the high volume of transactions and electronic data  the banking industry requires extensive computer capabilities to service its customers 
the change to the new year did not create any significant problems at old national or with its major customers 
results of operations net income old national s earnings rose to reach million in  an million increase  despite nearly million of charter consolidation expenses  net of security gains and taxes 
shareholders basic income per share for was  up over  and diluted earnings per share totaled  a increase over strong revenue growth tax equivalized net interest income plus noninterest income of million  an increase  generated the earnings growth in the specific effects of each of these factors are discussed in the following paragraphs 
old national s net income was million  up million above earnings 
revenue growth of million combined with reduced provision for loan loss created the increase in earnings 
net interest income as a financial intermediary  old national pays interest on deposits and other liabilities and receives interest and fee income on earning assets  such as loans and investments 
the difference between the income earned and the interest paid is net interest income which provides nearly of old national s revenues 
net interest margin is net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
incorporating the tax savings on certain assets permits effective yield comparability 
the net interest margin is influenced by a number of factors  such as the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  the interest rate environment  income tax rates  and the level of earning assets funded by interest free funding sources primarily noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
old national can influence the effect of these factors through its management of credit extension and interest rate sensitivity  both of which are discussed in detail later in this report 
external factors  such as the overall condition of the economy  credit demand strength  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws  can also have significant effects on changes in net interest income from one period to another 
on a taxable equivalent basis  net interest income grew  a million increase over average earning assets grew or million during nonearning assets rose million  in part due to increased cash in late as a precaution for yk 
included in other assets is cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli discussed in the noninterest income section of this report 
much of the asset growth was funded by interest bearing liabilities which increased million or 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million or  and other liabilities and equity provided an additional million of funding 
several factors combined to lower old national s net interest margin to 
earning asset yield declined basis points to 
the full year impact of declining interest rates in and competitive market pressures resulted in a basis point decrease in loan yields  despite the federal reserve bank raising interest rates throughout the last half of loans  however  comprised a higher percentage of assets  increasing to of earning assets and of total assets 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points to 
growth in higher rate certificate of deposits and borrowings contributed to the net interest margin compression  particularly during the last half of in net interest income grew or million and totaled million 
average earning assets grew  a million increase 
interest bearing liabilities rose million or 
the yield on earning assets declined basis points as all asset categories experienced similar declines 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points due to growth in the higher rate liabilities 
net interest margin declined from to due to these trends 
additionally  approximately basis points of the decrease was due to the purchase of boli which generates tax free noninterest income that is not included in net interest income

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity and liquidity customer preferences for loans and deposits generate certain levels of interest rate risk  which is the impact changing interest rates have on net interest income 
asset liability management s goal is to maximize and maintain adequate growth of net interest income within certain interest rate sensitivity and liquidity guidelines established by old national s balance sheet management committee 
this committee  comprised of old national senior managers  monitors asset liability issues and guidelines 
old national uses both static gap and income simulation methods to measure the impact of interest rate changes on its net interest income 
static gap  measured at a point in time  measures interest rate risk as the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities within a given repricing period and is expressed as a ratio and as a dollar amount known as the gap 
a ratio of suggests a balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities within a given repricing period 
while the measurement process and related assessment of risk are somewhat imprecise  old national believes its asset liability management program allows adequate reaction time for trends in the market place as they occur  thereby minimizing the potential negative effect of its gap position against the event of interest rate changes 
table below reflects old national s interest rate sensitivity position within specified time periods and cumulatively over various time horizons 
in the table  assets and liabilities are placed in categories based on their actual or expected repricing date 
in the day cumulative time frame  the assets to liabilities ratio was  down from in asset growth was primarily in time horizons greater than one year while liability growth was slightly more in periods under one year 
net interest income simulation modeling is used to better quantify the impact of potential interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
with this understanding  management can best determine possible balance sheet changes  pricing strategies  and appropriate levels of capital and liquidity which allow old national to generate strong net interest income while controlling and monitoring interest rate risk 
old national simulates both an immediate interest rate shock up and down basis points and a gradual change in rates of basis points up or down over months and sustained for additional months 
key model assumptions include asset prepayment speeds  changes in market conditions  loan volumes  and pricing  deposit sensitivity  and customer preferences and are inherently uncertain 
the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or the impact of interest rate changes 
actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  changes in market conditions  management strategies  among other factors 
old national s policy limit using the gradual rate change for the maximum negative impact on net interest income over months is 
at december   old national was well within that limit as the model s fluctuation was for the first months and less than for the total month period

liquidity management in addition to the interest rate sensitivity the balance sheet management committee monitors the company s liquidity position 
the objective is to ensure the ability to meet cash flow needs of customers  such as new loan demand and deposit withdrawals  while at the same time maximizing lending and investment opportunities 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements may result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations with expensive funding sources 
too much liquidity on the balance sheet is similarly undesirable as earnings will suffer due to underutilized resources 
old national s banking operations maintain adequate liquidity with sufficient levels of liquid assets  unpledged securities  deposit growth  and other alternative funding sources  such as the federal home loan bank fhlb and the federal reserve bank 
at december   the bank s debt rating was rated a by moody s and a by standard and poor s 
the parent company s sources of liquidity include bank lines of credit  capital markets  and affiliate banks dividends which are subject to regulatory limits and in some cases require regulatory approval 
notes and of the consolidated financial statements address this further 
at year end old national had million in available lines of credit from unaffiliated banks 
old national has capacity to issue up to million of a million medium term note program available for future liquidity needs 
at december   these securities were rated baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poor s 
noninterest income besides net interest income  old national generates additional revenue  noninterest income  through fees and sales commissions from its core banking franchise and other related businesses  such as investment products and insurance 
noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  grew in compared to in the trust fee income grew in and in trust fees benefited from a strong equity market in both years which was partially offset by a poor bond market in service charges on deposit accounts rose dramatically in with a increase compared to a in as part of one bank  worry free checking was introduced which produced higher levels of collectible overdraft fees 
loan servicing fees were relatively unchanged in  up  after a decline in lower mortgage banking and commercial loan fees in negated higher consumer loan fees 
bank owned life insurance revenue  a new initiative in  represented income on officers life insurance coverage  and in old national had a full year of the revenue 
insurance sales hit million  up in after growth in the sycamore agency purchased on december   is not included but will contribute additional revenue in investment and brokerage business increased in with revenue exceeding million  compared to growth in the coordination of trust and brokerage services contributed to this growth 
the remaining other income category was down million from which included loan sale gains 
in old national realized million in net securities gains as management restructured the investment portfolio and used these one time gains to partially offset the one time charter consolidation expenses 
during and  old national had minimal security sales

the challenge for old national and the industry is to achieve cost efficiencies while still providing quality customer service 
one key ratio used to evaluate performance is the efficiency ratio  with lower percentages representing positive trends 
old national s efficiency ratio net interest income  tax equivalized  plus noninterest income  excluding securities gains  divided by noninterest expense  was in  in  and in in consolidation expenses of million negatively impacted this ratio 
if these are removed  the ratio for would have been salaries and benefits  which comprised over of total noninterest expense  grew in and in as a part of charter restructuring in  old national had duplicate expenses as centralized operations were staffed up to take over certain functions but did not fully take over these operations until late in the year 
old national s strong earnings results and retirements  severance  and incentives linked to charter reduction which totaled million in  combined to increase incentives by million over levels 
equipment expense declined in after a increase in partially due to accelerated depreciation on equipment to be upgraded 
marketing expense increased in compared to a in in old national had several corporate wide promotions  such as worry free checking  yk advertising  and charter consolidation marketing efforts 
data processing expense rose over in both and in old national outsourced credit card processing which increased this particular expense 
in old national had a full year of this outsource expense and additional costs and higher expenses related to yk 
communications and transportation expense increased in and in higher postage in influenced by yk and restructuring represented over half of the overall increase 
professional fees increased in and in  a big portion of which related to consolidation consulting services

the major differences between the effective tax rate applied to old national s financial statement income and the federal statutory rate are caused by interest on tax exempt securities and loans and state income taxes 
old national s effective tax rate was in  in  and in the drop in rate in was due to a change in state tax laws and the implementation of certain tax saving strategies

investment securities investment securities at december   comprised of total assets  down from at year end investment securities increased million  over  as the focal point for asset growth was loans rather than investments 
while it does not actively trade its investment securities  old national has classified all securities as available for sale to maximize flexibility to adapt to interest rate changes 
the principal and interest payments along with the ability to pledge or liquidate  if necessary  available for sale securities provide funding to help meet unforeseen liquidity needs 
the entire portfolio has an effective duration of years 
at december   old national held investment securities issued by the certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market value million by illinois  million by indiana 
there were no other concentrations of investment securities issued by an individual state and its political subdivisions which were greater than of shareholders equity 
average yields on the investment securities portfolio are calculated on a taxable equivalent basis 
yields are based on the amortized cost and are weighted for the scheduled maturity of each investment

community loan personnel have the authority to extend credit under guidelines established and administered by old national s credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  includes members of old national s executive and community bank management 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans  and charge offs 
the committee regularly reviews the loan policy to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
executive and credit committees at the local level provide additional knowledge  judgment  and experience to old national s lending administration 
old national maintains an independent corporate loan review program 
its loan review system evaluates loan administration  credit quality  compliance with corporate loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this program includes periodic on site visits as well as regular off site reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies  and charge offs 
old national lends to commercial customers in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling  and retailing 
old national s policy is to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  and kentucky 
old national has no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of its portfolio nor does its portfolio contain any loans to finance speculative transactions  such as large  highly leveraged buyouts or loans to foreign countries 
the loan growth in was spread among all major categories but was strongest in the commercial sector

consumer credit increased in after a decrease in this growth included direct loans with consumers  loans acquired from dealers and direct home equity loans 
in as part of the common product drive  a corporate wide promotion for home equity loans contributed to this growth 
the portfolio is well diversified with of the portfolio in commercial loans  in commercial real estate  in residential real estate  and in consumer credit 
over the past five years  commercial and commercial real estate loans have grown faster relative to the other categories 
old national s commercial lending is primarily to small to medium sized businesses in various industries in its region 
commercial real estate loans are generally made to similar companies in old national s geographical area 
these industries have been stable in old national s market area and provide opportunities for growth 
a significant percentage of commercial loans are due within one year  reflecting the short term nature of a large portion of these loans 
table on page presents the maturity distribution and rate sensitivity of commercial loans and an analysis of these loans which have predetermined and floating interest rates 
residential real estate loans  primarily family properties  represent the most significant portion of the loan portfolio 
this sector s percentage of our total loan portfolio has remained fairly constant over the last several years 
old national s portfolio includes both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
consumer loans include automobile loans  personal and home equity loans and lines of credit  student loans  and credit card loans 
loans in most categories have grown steadily over the past four years 
commercial loans increased an average of per year between and commercial real estate grew  and residential real estate loans grew over the same period

this evaluation is based on reviews of specific loans  changes in the loan type and volume of the portfolios given current and anticipated economic conditions  and historical loss experience 
loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible 
charge offs  net of recoveries  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the most significant improvement in net charge offs occurred within the consumer portfolio 
in management revised its underwriting policies to address the changing nature and risk of consumer lending 
charge off levels for consumer loans have declined in both and net charge offs to average loans have consistently ranged from to for the last five years 
old national makes monthly provisions at levels deemed necessary to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
for homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card  provision levels are determined using historic loss factors 
for non homogeneous loans  management allocates specific losses to loans in the highest risk categories with provisions for the remainder of the portfolio using historic loss factors 
in addition  provisions reflect other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the geographic area  specific industry financial conditions  experience of lending staff  and borrower risk associated with year the provision for loan losses was million in  slightly lower than million in and million in the lower provision levels reflect the loan portfolio s performance as a result of the strong economy in old national s markets

under performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans where the ultimate collectibility of interest is uncertain  but the principal is considered collectible  loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
each month  problem loan reports are prepared and reviewed at both the community and holding company levels 
these reports include loans which show signs of being unable to meet debt obligations in the normal course of business  carry other characteristics deemed by bank management to warrant special attention  or have been criticized by regulators in the examination process 
besides the loans classified as under performing  management closely monitors loans totaling million at december   for the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms 
for these loans the existing conditions do not warrant either a partial charge off or classification as nonaccrual 
management believes it has taken a conservative approach in its evaluation of under performing credits and the loan portfolio in general  both in acknowledging the portfolio s general condition and in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
under performing assets as of year end totalled million in and million in as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were fairly consistent with in  in  and in the growth in nonaccruals in reflected a conservative nonaccrual policy and not a general deterioration of the portfolio
