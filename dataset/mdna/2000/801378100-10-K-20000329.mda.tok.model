if computer systems cannot distinguish between the year and the year  system failures or other computer errors could result 
to date  the company is not aware of the occurrence of any significant year problems being reported 
some business risks associated with the year issue many remain throughout however  it is not anticipated that future year issues  if any  will have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company of addressing year issues was approximately million  a significant portion of which was lease financed 
this amount was incurred for new software and related hardware and installation costs during fiscal in the company s corporate offices and operating restaurants 
effect of inflation 
food and labor costs are significant inflationary factors in the company s operations 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the statutory minimum wage  therefore  increases in the minimum wage increase the company s costs 
in addition  most of the company s leases require it to pay base rents with escalation provisions based on the consumer price index  in addition to percentage rentals based on revenues  and to pay taxes  maintenance  insurance  repairs  and utility costs  all of which are expenses subject to inflation 
the company has generally been able to offset the effects of inflation to date through small menu price increases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation through menu price increases 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the company s implementation of its stock re purchase program 
during fiscal  the company spent million to repurchase  shares of its outstanding stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal the company had a net loss in the amount of million including depreciation and amortization of million 
additionally  the company had a non cash charge to record an impairment loss on an investment in affiliate in the amount of million 
the company also used million in cash to pay down other current liabilities and had a current year provision for deferred income taxes of million 
investing activities required the company to use million in cash to fund million of capital additions  million to purchase short term investments and million to purchase new related party notes receivable 
these outflows are partially offset by net cash received from acquisitions of  and million in collections from related party and notes receivable 
financing activities required the company to spend million comprised of the following million to purchase treasury stock   to repay capital lease obligations   to repay the company s revolving line of credit and current installments of long term debt and million to repay other long term liabilities  offset by  in proceeds from long term borrowings 
the current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in working capital is due in large part to capital expenditures used to convert two under performing jb s to timber lodge steakhouses coupled with expenditures to repurchase the company s common stock 
the company s negative working capital balance is due to the la salsa  timber lodge and jb s concepts  which all have relatively small receivable and inventory balances which typically turn faster than accounts payable to vendors 
during fiscal the company completed the conversion of two under performing jb s restaurants to the timber lodge steakhouse concept at an average conversion cost of approximately  including pre opening costs 
the company completed six jb s remodels to improve and update the customer areas of the restaurants during these remodels cost between  and  per restaurant 
the company funded the jb s conversions to timber lodge and jb s remodels through available cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
the company believes it will be able to meet its working capital requirements through its cash flows from operations or through borrowings from its existing credit facility 
the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  including acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financings  the sale of assets or from other sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that equity or debt financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company
