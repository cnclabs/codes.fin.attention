item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
to mitigate the risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in those transactions  the company will generally enter into forward currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a currency 
decisions on whether to use such forward currency exchange contracts are made based on the amount of those exposures the currency involved  and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
these hedge instruments are managed to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
accordingly  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
the company s primary exchange rate exposure is with various european currencies  including the euro  the japanese yen  the australian dollar  and the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income 
the following forward exchange contracts held by the company have maturity dates in fiscal year all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  and fair value impact at october  were as follows dollars in thousands except average contracted rate average contracted rate notional amount fair value impact gain loss buy us sell australian dollar 
 buy us sell canadian dollar  buy us sell great british pound 
 buy german mark sell us  buy japanese yen sell us  debt financing the company s interest rate exposure results from short term rates  primarily libor based borrowings from commercial banks 
toro currently does not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates because the existing agreement is favorable compared to similar types of borrowing arrangements at current market credit spreads based on points over libor 
at october   the financial liabilities of the company exposed to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of million of short term debt outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical increase of percent basis points in short term interest rates with all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt  which is not subject to interest rate risk 
at october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying value of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed 
assuming a hypothetical increase of percent basis points in applicable interest rates  the estimated fair value of long term debt would decrease by million 
commodities certain raw materials used in the company s products are exposed to commodity price changes 
toro manages this risk by using purchase orders and long term agreements 
the primary commodity price exposures are with aluminum  steel  and plastic resin
