item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of minimed inc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the discussion in this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see language relating to forward looking statements preceding item  business 
general our sales and profits have been generated primarily through the sale of external pumps and related disposable products used to deliver insulin in the intensive management of diabetes 
additionally  through our acquisition of two distribution businesses  we have broadened our product offerings to include other diabetes supplies and pharmacy products generally used in the treatment of this disease 
product development and manufacturing operations have focused on four product lines external pumps  related disposable products  implantable insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems 
future development of the external pump and disposable product lines will focus upon improving the existing technologies for our current use of diabetes treatment and utilizing these technologies for the treatment of other medical conditions 
on september   we sold assets and transferred technology related to our implantable pump program to mrg 
we have retained exclusive marketing rights to the implantable pump product line for specific medical conditions  including diabetes 
sales of continuous glucose monitoring systems commenced in  as we launched a physician version of this product line after receiving regulatory approval in june  our continuous glucose monitoring system has been characterized as a first of its kind technology  and full commercialization will be subject to successful implementation of manufacturing  sales  marketing and reimbursement plans 
our long term goal is to link data obtained from our continuous glucose monitoring systems to our insulin delivery systems to create an artificial pancreas capable of controlling glucose levels in patients without substantive patient intervention 
during  we entered into two strategic relationships that will affect future product development  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  as well as financial performance 
in february  we entered into an agreement with lilly giving us a worldwide license to formulate  package and sell a new formulation of lilly s insulin lyspro for use with our programmable insulin infusion pumps 
we will offer this insulin to our patients in pre filled cartridges to be used exclusively in our external programmable insulin infusion pumps 
in june  we entered into agreements with a division of elan corporation  plc to manufacture and market exclusively under our name for insulin delivery a disposable  constant flow infusion system developed by elan 
our current plans are to offer this disposable infusion system to patients with type diabetes  further broadening our potential markets 
we will also manufacture this infusion system for elan and its other licensees for use with a variety of other pharmaceutical compounds 
our ability to market products related to each of these agreements is subject to regulatory approval  the timing and certainty of which are not predictable

fiscal and fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales increased in over to  from  our sales growth is primarily the result of an increase of  or  in sales of external pumps and related disposable products 
sales of external pumps grew in  with external pump domestic sales growing and external pump international sales increasing 
the domestic increase is primarily related to increased unit volume combined with a small increase in average selling prices 
the increase in external pump international sales is unit volume driven  as realized international average sales prices were slightly lower than in the domestic price increase was a function of the our continued efforts to increase the percentage of pump sales processed directly with third party payors rather than selling pumps at larger discounts to independent dealers  and market acceptance of price increases on our pumps related to technological enhancements introduced during the last two years 
international average selling prices for pumps and related disposable products were slightly lower in compared to due to increased sales in emerging foreign markets where independent dealers are utilized  compared to the prices realized in the markets where we have direct operations 
sales of the related disposable products increased in  with domestic sales growth at and international sales growth at 
similar to our external pumps  this increase in sales of disposable products was primarily volume driven in both the domestic and international markets 
two other factors influenced the sales growth of our disposable products 
first  we experienced a shift in product mix of the infusion sets sold  with customers moving to the more expensive models of our infusion sets 
second  similar to our external pump product line  domestic average sales prices have increased as a result of processing more sales directly with third party payors by our direct sales organization  as contrasted to sales to independent dealers 
sales of implantable pumps increased by or  in over sales activity of this product line remains limited due to the lack of required regulatory approvals  and to date  sales of implantable pumps have been generated mainly in connection with clinical trials and compassionate use of the pumps for patients with particularly difficult cases 
we originally received certification for the implantable pump under the applicable directives issued by the eu  and received the ce mark in march  thus permitting commercial sale throughout the eu 
an enhanced version of the implantable pump received the ce mark in february separate approval from the eu  however  is required for commercial sale of the insulin for use in the pump 
the insulin is manufactured by an independent pharmaceutical company  which also controls the regulatory filings for its insulin 
the implantable pump and the special insulin also remain subject to regulatory review and approval in the united states 
no assurance can be given as to when any of these approvals will be received  if at all 
sales of other diabetes supplies increased  or  in over this increase resulted from overall market growth and the commencement of internal efforts to market these products to our external pump patient base 
average sales prices for these products have increased in over  as a decreasing percentage of our diabetes supplies business was derived from lower paying medicare patients 
pharmaceutical products sales decreased  or  in compared to the sales decrease is a further continuation of our narrowing and restructuring of the pharmacy operations to better support our future business activities 
we believe that our pharmacy operations can become an important element in our distribution of pre filled insulin cartridges  products to treat other medical conditions and possibly our disposable infusion system for the treatment of type diabetes 
during the fourth quarter of we recognized our first revenues on sales of the continuous glucose monitoring system  although these sales were modest 
cost of sales and operating expenses 
cost of sales increased in over to  from  as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to in from in our overall gross margin percentage improvement was achieved primarily through margin improvement in the implantable pump  other diabetes supplies and pharmacy products 
implantable pump margins improved primarily due to cost reductions achieved because of the sale of assets and transfer of technology to mrg 
future margins on implantable pumps may be adversely impacted by a contractual purchase commitment for these products to mrg see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources 
margin improvements in other diabetes supplies and pharmacy product areas are the result of our repositioning of these businesses 
gross margin percentages on domestic sales of external pumps and the related disposable products remained constant in compared to while average sales prices on external pumps increased  manufacturing costs of external pumps also increased  as our latest model external pump incorporates several technological advancements including a remote bolus programming device 
additionally  included in cost of sales for domestic external pumps is a nonrecurring charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of for the estimated costs of correcting a software error on certain external pumps sold in october and november of domestic disposable product gross margin percentages remained consistent from to while the shift in product mix to more expensive infusion sets resulted in increased sales prices  the gross profit margin percentages on these enhanced infusion sets are lower due to higher product costs 
international gross margin percentages on external pumps and related disposable products decreased in from due to our increased expansion into new markets where we are realizing lower prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in over to  from  as a percentage of net sales  these expenses remained consistent for compared to selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased sales volumes  which led to increased sales commissions and other variable field and in house sales costs 
additionally  we continued the expansion of our direct sales organization during through the addition of new sales representatives  continued development of our managed care marketing efforts and an expanding commitment to field education and training 
we also increased international selling and marketing expenditures to expand our overall international presence  particularly in germany and in new international markets 
general and administrative expenses increased to support our growth  primarily in the areas of reimbursement and information systems 
research and development expenses increased in over to  from  as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to during from during the increase in research and development costs resulted from greater resources directed toward the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems and the related pilot manufacturing operations  development efforts related to future generations of external pumps  expansion of the data communication capabilities of our products  support of efforts for the use of our core technology in the treatment of other medical conditions  and product development efforts related to our pre filled insulin cartridge program and our disposable infusion systems 
research and development expenses will continue to rise during  as we plan to introduce several new products over the next two years  including the consumer version of our continuous glucose monitoring system  new generations of external insulin pumps and related disposable products including pre filled insulin cartridges  expansion of our core technology for the treatment of other medical conditions and our disposable infusion system  both for the treatment of type diabetes and under our commitment to supply this product to elan and its licensees 
during the first quarter  we signed a research and development contract with american medical instruments  inc  also known as ami  a member of the marmon group of companies 
under the terms of the agreement we perform research and development services on the development of electronics and telemetry for future models of infusion pumps 
upon achievement of quarterly performance milestones  we have received million in funding  million received in each of and  respectively 
subject to payment of royalties to ami  we have the right to sell products utilizing the technologies developed pursuant to the agreement on a worldwide basis  with the exception of japan 
we also have the right to purchase the technologies developed at prices ranging from an aggregate of million to million during certain periods commencing january and concluding april  during each of and  we recorded the million we received under this research and development contract as a reduction of operating expenses 
costs related to completion of the obligations under this agreement are included in research and development expense 
from time to time we invest in new and developing technologies that may provide improvements to our core technology or that may provide additional applications for our existing technologies and products 
these investments may be in the form of equity investments  loans  research and development agreements  and strategic alliances or cooperation agreements 
no assurance can be given as to when such investments will provide useful new technologies or applications  if at all 
such investments may result in losses that could adversely affect our future earnings and results of operations 
other 
other income for and consisted primarily of interest income generated from our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
these amounts increased due to additional cash from our offering of common stock which raised  in net proceeds to us 
our effective tax rate for and has been computed giving consideration to the pretax results applicable to our foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions and a continual decrease in our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to improved operating results 
we have not incurred any material foreign income tax expense to date 
inflation has not significantly impacted our results of operations for the past three years 
fiscal and fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales increased in over to  from  this increase is the result of an increase of  or  in sales of external pumps and related disposable products  offset by slower overall growth in our other business activities 
sales of external pumps grew  with domestic external pump sales rising  and international external pump sales climbing at an even higher rate of 
in both the domestic and international markets  sales growth was driven by increased unit volumes combined with increased average selling prices 
domestic external pump selling prices increased due in large part to our efforts to process a more significant percentage of our sales internally  rather than providing discounts to independent dealers  and a slight price increase related to a new model pump introduced during the international price increase is due to increased sales through our direct subsidiaries  primarily in germany and sweden  compared to sales to independent distributors in these areas during sales of the related disposable products grew at a rate of  with the domestic and international sales increasing at and  respectively 
disposable products pricing remained relatively consistent for compared to sales of other diabetes supplies increased  or  in over this increase resulted from overall market growth  combined with additional sales of these products as a result of our acquisitions of distributor organizations 
average sales prices have decreased for these products due to reimbursement trends 
pharmaceutical products sales decreased  or  in over the pharmacy operation historically distributed products to treat a number of medical conditions  including diabetes  hiv aids and renal failure 
the sales decrease primarily resulted from the our narrowing and restructuring of the pharmacy operations to better support our core activities and to better position us for future opportunities 
sales of implantable pumps decreased by or  in over  primarily due to the continued lack of required regulatory approvals required for commercialization of this product line 
cost of sales and operating expenses 
cost of sales increased in over to  from  as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to in from in this improvement in gross margins was directly attributable to the external pump and related disposable product line 
external pump gross profits increased due to an increase in realized domestic and international sales prices  continued improvement in product reliability and economies of scale related to increased volumes 
gross margins on the related disposable products decreased in the domestic and international markets 
this decrease was primarily attributable to our addition of a new disposable product line which was developed and manufactured for us by an outside vendor 
we realized a higher per unit cost on this product line than on our historical disposable products 
gross profits were adversely impacted by the implantable pump product line during due to continued limited sales prior to the product s full commercial release 
with our sale of certain assets and transfer of certain technology and operating activities to mrg on september   we experienced improved margins on this product line following such transaction 
mrg was founded by alfred e 
mann  the company s founder  chairman  ceo and largest stockholder 
mr 
mann is also the chairman  a director and a significant shareholder in mrg 
gross profits on other diabetes supplies decreased to  in  compared to  in this decrease in gross profit margin for other diabetes supplies was primarily due to the lower domestic average sales prices described above 
gross margins  as a percentage of sales  have decreased for pharmaceutical products during compared to as a result of the restructuring of the pharmacy operations and discontinuation of certain pharmaceutical product lines which were more profitable but were not consistent with our long term plans 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in over to  from  as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased slightly to in from in selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased sales volumes  which led to increased sales commissions and other variable field sales costs 
additionally  we expanded our direct sales organization during through the realignment of sales territories and the hiring of new sales representatives 
we also increased international selling and marketing expenditures to expand our overall international presence  particularly in germany 
general and administrative expenses increased as we have continued to build our infrastructure to manage increasing domestic and international sales activity  strengthen our collection function and expand information systems capabilities 
research and development expenses increased in over to  from  as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to during from during the increase in research and development costs resulted from greater resources directed toward the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems  start up manufacturing operations of the continuous glucose monitoring systems  development of future generation external insulin pumps and related disposable products  data communication capabilities for external pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems and a joint development project with roche diagnostics 
other 
other income for and consisted primarily of interest income generated from our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
interest expense in and relates primarily to debt incurred by hms prior to our acquisition to fund operations and to finance its operating facility 
substantially all of the hms debt was retired during in future periods  we expect to incur interest expense related to the notes payable that were issued in connection with the purchase of dss see discussion below in liquidity and capital resources 
our effective tax rate for and has been computed giving consideration to the pretax results applicable to our foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions and a continual decrease in our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to improved operating results 
we have not incurred any material foreign income tax expense to date 
inflation has not significantly impacted our results of operations for the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations of  in compared to cash used in operations of  during the increase in operating cash flows was the result of increased overall profitability and our tax benefits from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
these increases were offset by continued growth in our accounts receivable driven by sales growth and our continuing shift in business to direct sales and billing activities to third party payors 
this sales shift has led to a significant increase in accounts receivable balances due from third party payors  which are generally realized over a longer payment cycle 
our use of cash in included several factors 
we used cash in to retire approximately  in current liabilities related to our acquisitions of hms and dss 
these liabilities included  in trade payables of the hms pharmacy operations   in trade payables and accrued liabilities related to dss operations   in other accrued liabilities and all of the accrued but unpaid amounts related to the million in merger related expenses recorded in fiscal if we had not retired these liabilities  we would have generated cash flow from operating activities of  rather than the  reported as cash used in operations 
we also experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable in due to our shift to selling direct to patients through our in house sales organization rather than through independent distributors 
we also experienced an increase in inventory balances during in support of higher levels of business activity 
during  our cash flows from operating activities was  generated primarily from our increased profits 
capital expenditures were  for   for  and  for our capital expenditures included continued building improvements  manufacturing expansion  the acquisition of additional research and development engineering equipment and information systems upgrades 
the and capital expenditures related primarily to building manufacturing capacity for the continuous glucose monitoring systems  as well as other building improvements  manufacturing expansion  research and development engineering equipment and information systems upgrades to support growth 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will continue to increase at an even faster rate in support of our new product activities and to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate continuing growth 
we retired million in bank debt related to hms operations and used million of cash during the first quarter of to complete our acquisition of dartec  a scandinavian distributor 
in  we entered into a financing transaction pursuant to which we are constructing a corporate headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facility on the campus of california state university  northridge  the first phase of which will be financed with a million credit transaction 
we are in the process of attempting to increase this debt arrangement to further expand this facility 
the transaction was structured as a synthetic lease financing for the facility development and  in a related transaction  we obtained a revolving line of credit to borrow up to million 
under the terms of the financing transaction  a special purpose trust subleases the land to us and leases the improvements to us 
in connection with these financing transactions  we pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral security  and are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants regarding the conduct of our business 
these arrangements could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital or acquire additional capital resources or engage in certain strategic transactions 
the synthetic lease has an initial term of five years  with two one year renewal options 
the underlying ground lease has a term of years with renewal options for up to an additional years 
under these arrangements  we are committed to annual payments ranging from million to million commencing during the second half of additionally  we made payments of  during and are committed to average annual payments in future periods of approximately  plus periodic cost of living adjustments  per the terms of the ground lease for the northridge property 
these lease payments will be recorded as rent expense in future periods 
when the synthetic lease terminates  we will be able to assume the obligations of the special purpose trust as the lessee under the ground lease if we exercise our option to purchase 
on october   we acquired dss  a distributor of our products and other diabetes supplies located in south florida 
we acquired substantially all of the net assets of dss with payment of million consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable   of which was paid in and  of which is due in in connection with this acquisition  we also assumed certain liabilities and retired approximately million in short term and long term debt of dss during the fourth quarter 
on november   we entered into an agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of medtronic  inc enabling medtronic to purchase million of our common stock at per share  the approximate market value of the stock at that time 
medtronic purchased  shares of unregistered common shares during the fourth quarter  and we granted medtronic certain registration rights associated with the shares 
other financing activities during included an unsecured line of credit which enabled us to borrow up to million 
this line of credit expired and had never been drawn and was replaced with a new credit facility  described above 
in the process of integrating certain hms operations  we discovered certain business practices relating to charges billed to the state of florida which were implemented by prior ownership and that may potentially result in liability 
these billing practices were related to business activities of an affiliated pharmacy 
we have corrected the practices  notified the state of florida of our findings and initiated legal action against the prior owners to seek indemnification for any related liability that may be incurred by us 
the amount of potential liability  if any  cannot be determined at this time  although we believe that indemnification for such liability would be available from the prior owners 
we also are involved in certain other litigation  the financial impact of which is uncertain see notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received million during each of and under terms of our research and development contract with ami 
as indicated above  we have the right to either purchase the technologies developed or acquire a fully paid up  exclusive worldwide license for these technologies  in either case at prices ranging from an aggregate of million to million  subject to downward adjustment  during specific periods beginning january through april  alternatively  we may elect to pay royalties on sales of products utilizing the technology developed pursuant to the contract 
we have also entered into an agreement by which  among other transactions  we have acquired an option to purchase the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to a long term glucose sensor and related products being developed by mrg for million within days of mrg s first successful human full implant in a clinical trial performed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements 
in the event that we pursue either of these opportunities  additional capital resources may be required 
to retain our exclusive marketing rights for the implantable pump  we are required to purchase minimum quantities of some products from mrg 
future minimum purchase commitments for implantable pump units from mrg based upon current prices are total  the implantable pump and related insulin have not been approved for commercial distribution in the united states 
the implantable pump has been approved for commercial distribution in the eu  but sales will be limited until the special insulin used with the pump is approved 
we have accrued  as of january  and  as of december  related to implantable pump purchase commitment obligations in excess of expected usage 
management believes that our current level of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next to months 
the requirements for additional capital and working capital  however  are subject to change and will depend upon numerous factors  including the level of capital expenditures  especially relating to the new corporate headquarters and the development of our new insulin cartridge and disposable pump businesses  research and development activities and results  competitive and technological developments  health care reimbursement trends  and the availability for our acquisition of complementary additional distribution channels  products  and technologies 
during future periods  we may require significant amounts of cash to pursue opportunities and promote continued growth and expansion 
quarterly results the following table sets forth some of our selected consolidated financial information for our eight most recent quarters 
in the opinion of management  this unaudited financial information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial information  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments  necessary to present this information fairly when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on this form k 
q q q q in thousands  except per share data net sales     cost of sales     gross profits     net income     basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share q q q q in thousands  except per share data net sales     cost of sales     gross profits     net income     basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share our results of operations have historically fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
these seasonal trends have resulted in sales and earnings for each of the first three quarters being significantly lower than sales in the fourth quarter 
fluctuations of earnings from quarter to quarter have and will continue to result from numerous factors  including response to practices of insurance companies and other third party payors with respects to reimbursement for our products  which tend to result in increased sales of our external infusion pumps and disposables later in the calendar year  after patients deductibles are satisfied  market acceptance of our products  timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions  competition  our ability to manufacture our products efficiently  timing of research and development expenditures  and the structure of our sales compensation program 
year compliance the year problem  which we call yk  arose as a result of computer programs and other electronic devices containing microprocessors having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any information technology system with time sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this improper calculation of dates could result in disruptions of normal operations and systems failures 
we implemented a year action plan program  which we call the plan  in the second quarter of so that our computer systems would function properly in the year and thereafter 
our plan involved the review of a number of internal and third party systems 
we completed our system review and made certain modifications to our existing software and systems and or conversions to new software 
we estimate that  as of december   the cost of remediating our internal systems and equipment was approximately million 
we funded this effort through our normal working capital 
as a result  the year problem did not pose any operational problems 
because we experienced no major year related issues internally or externally over the year transition  we not currently believe that we will incur material costs or experience material disruptions in our business associated with yk 
however  there can be no assurance that our or our vendors current systems and product offerings do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in short term debt securities that are classified as available for sale 
two of the main risks associated with these investments are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of the debt securities 
fluctuations in interest rates should not have a material effect on our financial statements because of the short term nature of the securities in which we invest 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the debt securities will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
we have limited our investments to investment grade or comparable securities and have not experienced any losses on our investments to date due to credit risk
