you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risks faced by us described in this report  including those set forth under the section entitled risk factors in item  and the other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec  including our most recent reports on form k  form k  and form q  and amendments thereto 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales in fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in net sales was primarily a result of increased unit sales of switch  router  and access products  growth in the sales of add on boards that provide increased functionality  optical transport products  and maintenance  service  and support sales see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we manage our business on four geographic theaters the americas  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  asia pacific  and japan 
summarized financial information by theater for fiscal and is presented in the following table in millions percentage of amount net sales july  july  july  july  years ended net sales americas   emea   asia pacific  japan sales adjustments  total   the revenue growth for each theater was primarily driven by market demand and the deployment of internet technologies and business solutions 
gross margin in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal the following table shows the standard margins for each theater july  july  years ended standard margins americas emea asia pacific japan the net sales and standard margins by geographic theater differ from the amounts recognized under generally accepted accounting principles because we do not allocate certain sales adjustments  production overhead  and manufacturing variances and other related costs to the theaters 
sales adjustments relate to revenue deferrals and reserves  credit memos  returns  and other timing differences 
standard margins increased for all geographic theaters as compared with fiscal the decrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to shifts in product mix  introduction of new products  which generally have lower margins when first released  higher production related costs  the continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas  and the above mentioned sales adjustments  which were not included in the standard margins 
we expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  heightened price competition  increasing levels of services  higher inventory balances  introduction of new products for new high growth markets  and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
we believe gross margin may additionally be impacted due to constraints relating to certain component shortages that currently exist in the supply chain 
we may also experience a lower gross margin as the product mix for access and optical product volume grows 
we have recently introduced several new products  with additional new products scheduled to be released in the future 
increase in demand would result in increased manufacturing capacity  which in turn would result in higher inventory balances 
in addition  our vendor base is capacity constrained  and this could result in increased cost pressure on certain components 
if product or related warranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have experienced  gross margin may be adversely affected 
our gross margin may also be impacted by geographic mix  as well as the mix of configurations within each product group 
we continue to expand into third party or indirect distribution channels  which generally results in a lower gross margin 
in addition  increasing third party and indirect distribution channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product  and to a certain degree  the timing of orders from our customers 
downward pressures on our gross margin may be further impacted by other factors  such as increased percentage of revenue from service provider markets  which may have lower margins or an increase in product costs  which could adversely affect our future operating results 
research and development r d expenses in fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  an increase of 
r d expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase reflected our ongoing r d efforts in a wide variety of areas such as data  voice  and video integration  digital subscriber line dsl technologies  cable modem technology  wireless access  dial access  enterprise switching  optical transport  security  network management  and high end routing technologies  among others 
a significant portion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel  partly through acquisitions  as well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on additional lab equipment 
we also continued to purchase technology in order to bring a broad range of products to the market in a timely fashion 
if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal r d 
all of our r d costs are expensed as incurred 
we currently expect that r d expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in technology to address potential market opportunities 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  an increase of 
sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions  additional marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products  the expansion of distribution channels  and general corporate branding 
the increase also reflected our efforts to invest in certain key areas  such as expansion of our end to end networking strategy and service provider coverage  in order to be positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities 
we currently expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative g a expenses in fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of 
g a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal g a expenses for fiscal and included acquisition related costs of approximately million and million  respectively 
excluding the acquisition related costs  the increase in g a expenses was primarily related to the addition of new personnel and investments in infrastructure 
we intend to keep g a expenses relatively constant as a percentage of net sales  however  this depends on the level of acquisition activity and our growth  among other factors 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets primarily relates to various purchase acquisitions see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets will continue to increase as we acquire companies and technologies 
the amount expensed to in process research and development in process r d arose from the purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of the existing products and patents  as well as the technology currently under development  were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
these risk factors have increased the overall discount rate for acquisitions in the current year 
we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high technology communications equipment industry 
however  we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations for our significant purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal and in millions  except percentages acquisition assumptions estimated cost to complete risk adjusted technology at discount time of rate for in acquired company acquisition process r d fiscal monterey networks  inc the optical systems business of pirelli spa aironet wireless communications  inc atlantech technologies jetcell  inc pentacom  ltd 
qeyton systems fiscal summa four  inc clarity wireless  inc selsius systems  inc pipelinks  inc amteva technologies regarding our purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal and  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
shipment volumes of products from the above acquired technologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present time 
therefore  it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology or product life cycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to interest income related to the general increase in cash and investments  which was generated from our operations 
net gains realized on minority investments were million in fiscal the net gains realized on minority investments were not material in fiscal our pro forma effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the actual effective tax rate was  which included the impact of nondeductible in process r d and acquisition related costs 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower effective rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations 
additionally  we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock option exercises see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales in fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in net sales was primarily a result of increased unit sales of lan switching products  access servers  high performance wan switching and routing products  and maintenance service contracts 
gross margin in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal the decrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to our continued shift in revenue mix toward our lower margin products and the continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas 
r d expenses in fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  an increase of 
r d expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase reflected our ongoing r d efforts in a wide variety of areas such as data  voice  and video integration  dsl technologies  cable modem technology  wireless access  dial access  enterprise switching  security  network management  and high end routing technologies  among others

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we do not expect the initial adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our operations or financial position 
we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year in september  the fasb issued emerging issues task force topic no 
d  accounting for payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises eitf d 
eitf d requires that payroll tax paid on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with an employee s exercise of stock options be recorded as operating expenses 
payroll tax on stock option exercises of million was expensed in fiscal in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
at this time  we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material effect on our operations or financial position  however  the sec s final guidance for implementation has not been released to date 
we are required to adopt sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and investments were billion at july   an increase of billion from july  the increase was primarily a result of billion of net unrealized gains on publicly held investments and billion of cash generated by operating and financing activities partially offset by investing activities  including net capital expenditures of billion  purchases of technology licenses of million  and investments in lease receivables of million 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal days sales outstanding in receivables increased to days for fiscal  from days for fiscal the increase in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding was due  in part  to growth in total net sales combined with conditions in a number of markets  resulting in longer payment terms 
inventories increased during fiscal  however  inventory turns remained constant at times 
the increase in inventory levels reflected new product introductions  continued growth in our two tier distribution system  and increased purchases to secure the supply of certain components 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
at july   we had a line of credit totaling million  which expires in july there have been no borrowings under this agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have entered into several agreements to lease acres of land located in san jose  california  where our headquarters operations are established  and acres of land located in boxborough  massachusetts  salem  new hampshire  richardson  texas  and research triangle park  north carolina  where we have expanded certain r d and customer support activities 
in connection with these transactions  we have pledged billion of our investments as collateral for certain obligations of the leases 
we anticipate that we will occupy more leased property in the future that will require similar pledged securities  however  we do not expect the impact of this activity to be material to our liquidity position see note to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  line of credit  and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure  and investment requirements through at least the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
for example  as a result of recent market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments  we experienced a million after tax unrealized loss during the third quarter of fiscal and a billion after tax unrealized gain during the fourth quarter of fiscal on these investments 
we have also invested in numerous privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
we also have certain real estate lease commitments with payments tied to short term interest rates 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio while increasing the costs associated with our lease commitments 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
investments the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held at july  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps over a month horizon 
beginning fair values represent the principal plus accrued interest and dividends of the interest rate sensitive financial instruments at july  ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest  dividends  and reinvestment income at a month horizon

the following analysis presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of public equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the hypothetical change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in each stock s price 
stock price fluctuations of plus or minus  plus or minus  and plus or minus were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
the following table estimates the fair value of the publicly traded corporate equities at a month horizon in millions valuation of securities valuation of securities given x decrease given x increase in each stock s price fair value in each stock s price as of july  corporate equities        our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the s p index or companies traded on the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq composite index has shown a movement in each of the last three years and a and movement in at least one of the last three years 
we also have an investment in kpmg consulting  inc in the principal amount of billion of series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  which carries a dividend rate on the original issue price until converted to common stock 
conversion is at our option upon or after the completion of an initial public offering of kpmg consulting  inc we have not included the investment in the above sensitivity analyses due to the nature of this investment 
leases we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases on our facilities where payments are tied to the london interbank offered rate libor 
we have evaluated the hypothetical change in lease obligations held at july  due to changes in the libor 
the modeling technique used measures hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the libor 
the hypothetical market changes reflected immediate parallel shifts in the libor curve of plus or minus bps  bps  and bps over a month period 
the results of this analysis were not material in comparison to our financial results 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in australian  canadian  japanese  korean  and several european currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
we also periodically hedge anticipated transactions with purchased currency options 
the foreign exchange forward and option contracts we enter into generally have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts for trading purposes 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results see note to the consolidated financial statements
