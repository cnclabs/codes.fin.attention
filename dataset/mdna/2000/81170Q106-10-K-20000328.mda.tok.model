item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
important factors that might cause such a difference include  among other things  general economic conditions  particularly the real estate market  in the company s primary market area  potential increases in the company s non performing assets as well as increases in the allowance for loan losses that might be necessary  concentrations of loans in a particular geographic area or with certain large borrowers  changes in government regulation and supervision  including increased deposit insurance premiums or capital or reserve requirements  changes in interest rates  and increased competition and bank consolidations in the company s market area 
these and other factors that might cause differences between actual and anticipated results  performance and achievements are discussed in greater detail in this form k under management s dicussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
general seacoast financial s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by seacoast financial s provision for loan losses  as well as noninterest income and expenses 
seacoast financial s noninterest income consists principally of gains and losses from sales of loans and securities  deposit and other banking fees 
seacoast financial s non interest expenses consist principally of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  data processing  marketing and professional services costs and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially affect seacoast financial and compass 
stock conversion and merger on november   the company completed its mutual to stock conversion and initial public offering of common stock whereby  shares were sold at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of the stock offering were million 
on december   the company merged with sandwich and issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of sandwich other than shares owned by seacoast financial and fractional shares based on an exchange ratio of shares of seacoast financial common stock for each share of sandwich common stock

change in fiscal year end in january  the board of directors voted to change the company s year end from october to december the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a comparison of financial condition at december  and october  the results of operations for the two month transition period ended december  are separately presented in the accompanying financial statements at page of this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to are for the calendar year ended december  and all references to and are for the fiscal years ended october comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased by million  or  from  million at december  to  million at december  this growth was due to a million  or  increase in loans  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in investment securities and a million decrease in cash  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
asset growth was funded primarily by a million  or increase in borrowings and  to a lesser extent  a million  or  increase in deposits 
the increase in loans occurred primarily in compass s indirect auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios 
from december  to december   indirect auto loans net of unearned discounts increased by million  or 
this growth is primarily attributable to the generally favorable interest rate environment and economic conditions which prevailed during the period and the continued emphasis of this area of lending 
residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  during due to the favorable conditions cited above and the utilization of two loan correspondents with whom compass originated million in residential mortgage loans  compass originated million of residential mortgage loans in  a increase over the net growth in this portion of the loan portfolio was also affected by the strategy to retain in portfolio fixed rate mortgage loan originations that in recent years were generally sold in the secondary mortgage market 
total deposits at december  were  million  an increase of million  or  compared to  million at december  this modest increase included an increase in core deposits of million  or  partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in certificates of deposit 
the increase in core deposits was primarily due to the expansion of the compass brand to the cape cod market through the acquisition of the former sandwich bank in december  partially offset by a continuing low interest rate environment wherein compass competes against other instruments available to the public such as mutual funds and annuities 
the decline in certificates of deposits reflects the same competitive factors which have impacted core deposit growth and  in addition  reflects aggressive price competition for such accounts among local financial institutions in reaction to rate increases initiated by the federal reserve bank during the second half of the year 
total borrowed funds were million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
during the year ended december   compass s net borrowings from the fhlb increased by million and its retail repurchase agreements increased by million

management expects to fully repurchase the remaining  shares under these programs during comparison of financial condition at december  and october  total assets increased by million  or  from  million at october  to  million at december  this growth was entirely due to an million  or increase in loans 
asset growth was funded by the net proceeds of the stock offering which amounted to million  of which million at october  was included in deposits earmarked for the purchase of common stock in the stock offering 
the increase in loans occurred primarily in the residential mortgage and indirect auto loan portfolios 
from october  to december   residential mortgage loans increased by million exclusive of a transfer of loans previously classified as held for sale  or  and indirect auto loans net of unearned discounts increased by million  or 
the growth during the two months ended december  is generally attributable to the favorable interest rate environment and economic conditions which prevailed during this period and  more specifically  is due to the previously disclosed temporary change in practice  which began in november  to retain in portfolio all fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations 
the company has continued to emphasize the origination of indirect auto loans through its network of automobile dealers causing the growth in this portfolio 
total deposits at december  were  million  a decrease of million  or compared to  million at october  as indicated above  a portion of the proceeds of the stock offering was funded by either deposit accounts of bank customers or by non customers who had funded their stock subscription with the bank at october  of the million of net proceeds of the stock offering  million was funded from the deposits of bank customers and million was funded from non customer subscription accounts  of which was held by the bank as deposits at october  these funds  totaling million  were transferred to stockholders equity in november when the stock offering was completed 
exclusive of this transfer  deposits increased by less than during the two months ended december   a cyclical period which has historically been one of modest deposit growth 
total borrowed funds were million at december  compared to million at october   a decrease of million  or 
the increase in stockholders equity of million to million at december  resulted from the net proceeds of the stock offering of million partially offset by the net loss of million for the two months ended december  as discussed more fully in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the net loss was caused by certain one time charges including merger costs of million associated with the sandwich acquisition and a writedown of banking premises and equipment of million necessitated by the decision to consolidate most banking functions in a new corporate headquarters which will result in the ultimate disposal of several buildings currently in use 
comparison of financial condition at october  and october  total assets increased by million  or  from  million at october  to  million at october  this growth was due primarily to a million  or  increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million  or  increase in loans  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in investment securities 
asset growth was funded primarily by a million  or  increase in deposits 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents at october  was primarily attributable to the receipt of significant funds being held in escrow in connection with the company s subscription offering of stock 
the increase in loans occurred primarily in compass s indirect auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios 
from october  to october   indirect auto loans net of unearned discounts increased by million  or 
this growth is primarily attributable to the favorable interest rate environment and economic conditions which prevailed during the period and the continued emphasis of this area of lending 
residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  during due to the favorable interest rate environment which prevailed  compass originated million of residential mortgage loans in  a increase over as the bank continued to sell fixed rate loans with terms of years or longer during and due to the high volume of loan refinancing attributable to lower interest rates  the net growth in this portion of the loan portfolio was constrained 
total deposits at october  were  million  an increase of million  or  compared to  million at october  the increase in deposits was primarily due to favorable economic conditions and the impact of escrowed deposits of million received in the subscription offering portion of the company s initial public offering of stock  partially offset by a continuing low interest rate environment wherein compass competes against other instruments available to the public such as mutual funds and annuities 
total borrowed funds were million at october  compared to million at october   a decrease of million  or 
during the year ended october   compass s net borrowings from the fhlb decreased by million and its retail repurchase agreements increased by million 
the increase in surplus of million to million at october  resulted from net income of million for the year ended october  and a million increase in unrealized gains net of taxes on securities available for sale  most of which pertained to the marketable equity securities portfolio  partially offset by elimination of the portion of the company s pre acquisition stock investment in sandwich which had been purchased in results of operations net interest income the company s performance is primarily attributable to its level of net interest income 
general economic conditions  corporate strategies  asset liability management and the policies of regulatory authorities all have a significant impact on the level of net interest income achieved 
during the period to  the company s net interest income increased from million for the year ended october  to for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this achievement has been attributable to the company s growth in average interest earning assets and the increase in the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities over that same period 
the increase in such ratio is primarily attributable to the of net proceeds from the company s initial public stock offering in november during the period to  the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities has declined slightly from in to in this decrease is primarily attributable to the relative increase in compass s utilization of borrowings  rather than lower cost deposits  to fund asset growth

net income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
due primarily to an increase in average interest earning assets of million  or  net interest income increased by million  or  from million in to million in the other significant factors affecting the change in net income was an increase of  in the provision for loan losses and an increase of million in non interest expense 
the company s effective rate declined to in from in interest income 
interest income was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase in interest income resulted exclusively from average interest earning asset growth of million or 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points in from in to in a significant portion of the increase in average interest earning assets was attributable to the indirect auto loan portfolio  which increased from million at october  to million at december   and the mortgage loan portfolio  which increased from million to  million  at those dates  respectively 
the net proceeds of the november stock offering of million had a significant impact on the company s interest income 
of the increase of million in interest income in  approximately million was attributable to the earnings on the use of the net proceeds of the stock offering after consideration of the impact of stock repurchases 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  or  from million in to million in the increase resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on such liabilities 
total average interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  with most of the increase occurring in lower cost core deposits 
because of the level of loan growth  compass increased its advances from the fhlb with the average amount of such borrowings outstanding increasing by million  or  from million in to million in provision for loan losses 
compass establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that management estimates is appropriate to absorb future charge offs of loans deemed uncollectible 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers past and anticipated loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions  volume and type of lending and the levels of nonperforming and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses monthly in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for loan losses increased by  or  from million in to million in the total allowance of million at december  represented 
of total loans  a decrease from at october  this decrease reflects the impact of the growth in the loan portfolio in which growth has occurred in the historically less risky residential mortgage loan and indirect auto loan portfolios 
at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was compared to at december  non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of fees and charges for bank services  net interchange fees on the processing of merchant credit card receipts  gains or losses from sales of assets  loan servicing fees and other income resulting from various types of banking transactions 
total non interest income was million in and included in non interest income in is a million gain on termination of the bank s pension plan 
exclusive of this non recurring item  non interest income declined million due entirely to a million decrease in gains on the sale of loans and investments 
such decline is a result of the change in practice  beginning in november  whereby compass is no longer selling fixed rate residential mortgage loans with terms of years or longer in the secondary mortgage market 
as a result of the decision to terminate its defined benefit pension plan and to enhance its k plan  compass expects to realize annual savings of approximately  beginning in and a non recurring settlement gain of approximately million in non interest expense 
non interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million related to salaries and employee benefits  which rose to million in this increase is attributable to overall salary increases averaging in  costs associated with the esop established in november  and restricted stock awarded in july  partially offset by elimination of certain executive positions at the former sandwich bank

marketing expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to lower than normal marketing costs at the former sandwich bank in the period due to the impending merger with the company and increased costs in associated with a program to attract new customers affected by the branch divestiture required by the fleet bankboston merger 
professional services expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with being a public company as well as costs incurred to develop the bank s strategic plan  assess business expansion opportunities  implement the stock award program  implement the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and review the defined benefit pension plan 
other non interest expenses increased  or  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to certain nonrecurring costs associated with the merger with sandwich 
income taxes 
total income tax expense was million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was lower in than in primarily because of greater utilization of non bank subsidiaries that were taxed at a lower rate for state tax purposes and an increase in federal low income housing tax credits 
comparison of operating results for the years ended october  and october  general 
net income increased by million or  from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  the improvement was attributable to higher net interest income of million  a  decrease in the provision for loan losses due to a continuation of the favorable trends in the various factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and an increase in net gains on sales of loans of million 
also impacting the change in net income was an increase of million in non interest expense due to higher salaries  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing expenses and marketing costs 
the increase in net interest income was due to growth in average interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended october  was million  compared to million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or 
all of the increase in interest income resulted from growth in average interest earning assets of million  or as the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points in from in to in the principal areas of growth related to real estate loans up million  or and indirect auto loans up million  or 
most of the real estate loan growth resulted from increased originations of one to four family real estate loans 
the increase in indirect auto loans resulted from an improved economic environment within compass s local markets  the expansion of such lending into rhode island and the continued emphasis of this area of lending 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended october  was million  compared to million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or 
this increase resulted entirely from a higher average balance of interest bearing liabilities up million  or

compass provided million for loan losses in the year ended october  compared to million in the year ended october   a decrease of  or 
the total allowance of million at october  represented of total loans  a decrease from at october  these decreases were primarily influenced by a reduction in the balance of adversely classified loans and fewer delinquencies 
non interest income 
total non interest income was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in the gain on sale of mortgage loans  from  in the year ended october  to million in the year ended october  with the reduction in interest rates on and year fixed rate mortgages which occurred in and  the volume of fixed rate mortgage loan originations increased which contributed to this increase 
also  compass earned  of fees in under a new relationship with an outside vendor which processes its official checks

non interest expense 
non interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  of this increase  million related to compensation and employee benefits  which rose to million for the year ended october  the higher level of compensation and employee benefits was caused by overall salary increases averaging  increased commissions related to higher mortgage loan originations  an increase in incentive compensation and other employee benefits as well as staffing increases in the lending area and in a new branch opened in may occupancy and equipment expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended october  this increase was primarily due to an increase in rent expense attributable to the relocation of the bank s operations department  the opening of a new branch  an upgraded branch and a one time reduction in rent expense in of  attributable to a leased facility no longer utilized

liquidity and capital resources compass s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents and debt securities is a product of its operating  investing  and financing activities 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage related securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and  in the case of deposits  other instruments available to the public such as mutual funds and annuities 
as a voluntary number of the fhlb of boston  compass is entitled to borrow an amount up to the value of its qualified collateral that has not been pledged to others 
qualified collateral generally consists of residential first mortgage loans  us government and agency securities and funds on deposit at the fhlb 
at december   compass had million in unused borrowing capacity that is contingent upon the purchase of additional fhlb of boston stock 
use of this borrowing capacity may also be impacted by regulatory capital requirements 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
the measure of a bank s liquidity is its ability to meet its cash commitments at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price 
at december   the company maintained cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year of million  or of total assets 
compass invests excess funds  if any  in federal funds sold which provides liquidity to meet lending requirements 
at december   construction of the bank s new corporate headquarters was in progress 
at that date  the estimated remaining construction and related costs to be incurred were million 
compass believes it has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these expenditures 
at december   compass had commitments to originate loans  unused outstanding lines of credit  standby letters of credit and undisbursed proceeds of loans totaling million 
compass anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit maturing within one year from december  amounted to million 
compass expects that substantially all maturing certificate accounts will be retained by compass at maturity  although the percentage retained may be below historical levels due to increased price competition for these deposits 
compass s tier capital measured of risk weighted assets at december  total capital  including the tier allowance for loan losses  was of risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio was 
these ratios placed compass in the well capitalized category according to regulatory standards 
the company s tier capital measured of risk weighted assets at december  total capital  including the tier allowance for loan losses  was of risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio was 
these ratios placed the company in excess of regulatory standards set forth by the federal reserve board 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
management does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the financial position or operating results of the company 
year issue the year issue commonly referred to as yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to define the applicable year 
the yk issue  which was common to most corporations  including banks  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily but not exclusively computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information as the year approaches and beyond 
the following constitutes the company s yk readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
compass took numerous remedial steps over the past several years to prepare for the change of century 
these steps included forming a yk project team to develop and implement a yk action plan  replacing or upgrading noncompliant hardware and software  working with third party service bureaus and other vendors to ensure that compass s mission critical information systems were yk compliant  and establishing contingency plans in the event that an unforseen problem were to arise 
compass has experienced no problems or issues relating to yk as of the date of this report 
compass s technology infrastructure performed without any disruption  loss of data or customer inconvenience during rollover weekend  which was the period from friday  december  through the opening of normal business activities on monday  january  extensive monitoring and testing was performed with service bureaus and key outside vendors to satisfy connectivity and performance requirements 
there were no yk reportable incidents that weekend or thereafter 
all mission critical systems that included hardware  software  program interfaces  operating systems as well as other mechanical or computer generated requirements  including compass s main central processing system and network performed normally  as expected 
bank customers were able to make deposits to or withdrawals from deposit accounts  credit loan payments  apply for new loans  etc  and engage in normal banking activities 
the yk project team will continue to monitor performance of mission critical systems in for potential yk issues 
the chief components of compass s expense related to the yk issue has been the replacement of personal computer equipment and the purchase or upgrade of third party software 
external maintenance and internal modification costs have been expensed as incurred 
costs of new hardware and software have been capitalized and are being depreciated in accordance with compass s policies 
management expended approximately million on its year readiness efforts through december  of which  was for capitalizable items 
compass completed five mailings of yk information to all customers with statement accounts 
also  letters have been sent to major commercial loan customers and automobile dealerships informing them of the year issue and how it can impact businesses 
an overall assessment of the yk readiness of compass s commercial loan customers was completed in october  with an overall assessment of low to medium risk 
the bank will continue to monitor its large commercial loan relationships through account officers contact programs 
to date  compass is not aware that any of its commercial loan customers have encountered any material yk problems with their computer systems 
if compass s commercial customers are not year compliant and suffer adverse effects on their operations  their ability to meet their obligations to the bank could be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the chief market risk factor affecting the financial condition and operating results of seacoast financial and compass is interest rate risk 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given compass s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board 
through such management  compass seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net earnings to changes in interest rates 
compass s asset liability committee  comprised of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and reviewing with compass s board of directors on a quarterly basis its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on compass s and seacoast financial s operating results  compass s interest rate risk position and the effect changes in interest rates would have on compass s net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies seacoast financial and compass use to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate loans  origination of indirect auto loans which have relatively short maturities and origination of loans with maturities at least partially matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and iii classifying a significant majority of its investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
seacoast financial quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
compass s internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for every basis points immediate shift in interest rates  its estimated net interest income over the next months should decline by less than 
in utilizing a basis point increase in rates in its simulation model  the full impact of annual rate caps of basis points common to most adjustable rate mortgage loan products is considered 
the rate shocks used assume an instantaneous and parallel change in interest rates 
prepayment speeds for loans are based on published median dealer forecasts for each interest rate scenario 
as of december   seacoast financial s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve and twenty four month periods is as follows percentage change in estimated net interest income over months months basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates based on the scenario above  net income would be adversely affected within compass s internal guidelines in both the twelve and twenty four month periods 
for each one percentage point change in net interest income  the effect on net income would be  assuming a tax rate
