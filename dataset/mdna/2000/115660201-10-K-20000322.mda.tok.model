in  gas and oil production cost was 
taxes on gas and oil production increased from to as a result of the higher gas and oil sales but remained constant as a percentage of sales

capital resources and liquidity growth and acquisitions the company continues to pursue opportunities which will add value by increasing its reserve base and presence in significant natural gas areas  and further developing the company s ability to control and market the production of natural gas 
as the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  it will benefit from its financing flexibility and the leverage potential of the company s overall capital structure

the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company is able to adjust the level of its capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors

markets and prices wildhorse provides gathering  processing and storage to rocky mountain gas and oil producers 
during  the company s share of wildhorse s investments approximated million for gas gathering and processing assets 
the company percent and km percent jointly own wildhorse 
the company dedicated significant amounts of its rocky mountain gas production to wildhorse for gathering  and processing 
the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as no amounts of the company s future gas and oil production have been sold at contractually specified prices

forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas no 
must be applied to derivative instruments that were issued  acquired  or substantially modified after december  the company is evaluating sfas no 
and has not yet quantified the impact adopting the statement will have on its financial statements 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use

the company adopted sop in the first quarter of fiscal and adoption did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company utilizes various financial instruments which inherently have some degree of market risk 
the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rate fluctuations 
price fluctuations the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
accordingly  in order to increase the financial flexibility and to protect the company against commodity price fluctuations  the company may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  enter into non speculative hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements relating to natural gas and crude oil 
in connection with an advance payment for future natural gas deliveries  the company entered into three gas price swap contracts with third parties under which the company became a fixed price payor for  mmbtu per day for a twelve month period commencing january at a weighted average price of per mmbtu 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus an applicable margin or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately  as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value
