compared to net interest income an analysis of the company s net interest income and average balance sheet for the last five years is presented in table one and table two 
net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
the increase was due largely to the growth in average earning assets offset  to some extent  by a decrease in net interest margin 
average earning assets increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase  while yields earned on average assets decreased by basis points compared to the same period 
average loans and acceptances discounted increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase  while average interest earning deposits due from other banks increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
net interest margin decreased to percent for the year ended december  from percent for the same period in  a basis point decrease 
the primary reasons for this decrease were i loan yields relative to reference rates decreased in certain countries in the region and ii transactions with larger customers and transactions with multi national customers  which command more competitive pricing 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase  reflecting an increase in loans in the region and the united states  partially offset by a decrease in prevailing interest rates and a tightening of loan spreads in the region as discussed above 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase  reflecting the increase in deposits to fund asset growth and a two basis point increase in interest rates paid 
average interest bearing deposits increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
the growth in deposits was primarily a result of the company increasing its core deposit base from its expanding branch network  as well as its international customers 
the company s time deposits due from banks also increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in an analysis of the company s yields earned and average loan balances segregating domestic and foreign earning assets is presented in table three 
the yields earned on domestic loans have decreased by three basis points to percent from percent 
provision for credit losses the company s provision for credit losses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this percent increase was largely a function of the percent growth in total loans 
net loan chargeoffs during the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million for the year ended december  the allowance for credit losses was increased to million at december  from million at december   a percent increase 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was percent at december  from percent for the same period in a more detailed review of the provision for credit losses is presented in table seventeen through table nineteen 
non interest income non interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
trade finance fees and commissions increased by thousand due largely to lending facility fees which increased by thousand during compared to as a result of the growth in loans 
structuring and syndication fees increased by thousand as a result of various structuring and syndication transactions completed during the year increasing these fees to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
customer service fees increased by thousand 
the changes in non interest income from year to year are analyzed in table six 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
the growth in expenditures was primarily to support revenue growth 
a discussion of the significant components of noninterest expense in compared to is as follows employee compensation and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase 
this was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees to at december  from at the same period in the majority of the employees were added to support the puerto rico branch and other areas within the bank 
there were also salary increases for existing personnel 
occupancy expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  a percent increase as a result of the additional branches 
other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  primarily due to the increase in legal expense as a result of various litigation actions commenced by or against the company in the company s efficiency ratio experienced a favorable decrease to percent in from percent in the changes in operating expenses from year to year are analyzed in table seven 
the company s income tax expense for was million  for an effective tax rate of percent of pretax income 
income tax expense for was million for an effective rate of percent 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is the result of a state income tax refund for prior year filings 
the increase of income tax expense was the result of the percent increase in pretax income 
as the company increases its foreign loans and investments in relation to total assets these activities are not taxable in the state of florida  thus reducing the overall effective tax rate 
note six of the consolidated financial statements includes an analysis of the components of the provision for income taxes 
balance sheet review compared to the company manages its balance sheet by monitoring interest rate sensitivity  credit risk  liquidity risk and capital positions to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income that might result from changes in interest rates 
control of interest rate risk is conducted through systematic monitoring of maturity mismatches 
the company s investment decision making takes into account not only the rates of return and their underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  including minimum cash reserves  withdrawal and maturity of deposits and additional demand for funds 
total consolidated assets increased one percent  or million for the year ended december   which included an increase of million in interest earning assets and a decrease of million in non interest earning assets 
the increase in consolidated assets reflects an increase of million in securities available for sale offset by a decrease in net loans of million 
the overall increase in consolidated assets was principally funded by deposits from the branch network and in retained earnings 
cash  demand deposits with other banks and federal funds sold cash  demand deposits with other banks and federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents 
balances of these items fluctuate daily depending on many factors which include or relate to the particular banks that are clearing funds  loan payoffs  deposit gathering and reserve requirements 
cash  demand deposits with other banks and federal funds sold were million at december  compared to million at december  interest earning deposits with other banks and securities interest earning deposits with other banks decreased to million at december  from million at december  as part of its overall liquidity management process  the company places funds with foreign correspondent banks 
these placements are primarily short term  typically days or less 
the purpose of these placements is to obtain an enhanced return on high quality short term instruments and to solidify existing relationships with correspondent banks 
the banks with which placements are made and the amount placed are currently approved by the bank s asset liability committee 
in addition  this committee reviews adherence with internal interbank liability policies and procedures 
as indicated in table eight these interest earning deposits with other banks are well diversified throughout the region and in other countries 
the level of such deposits has decreased principally  related to reductions in ecuador  bahamas and the dominican republic 
the short term nature of these deposits allows the company the flexibility to redeploy these assets into higher yielding loans which are largely related to the financing of trade 
investment securities increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase has been primarily in foreign debt securities classified as available for sale 
on december  management changed its original intent with respect to million in bearer debt securities which were classified as loans and accounted for as held to maturity securities under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities  along with all other securities classified as held to maturity  were transferred to and are being accounted for as securities available for sale at fair market value under sfas no

loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio decreased by million during the year ended december  in relation to december  this decrease was due primarily to the transfer of bearer debt securities classified as loans to securities available for sale discussed earlier 
at december   commercial domestic loans increased by million which resulted from management s ability to increase lending in the u 
s 
market 
at december  approximately percent of the company s portfolio consisted of loans to domestic borrowers and percent of the company s portfolio consisted of loans to foreign borrowers 
this represents an increase of percent in u 
s 
exposure as the company concentrated its efforts on this market due to slow economic conditions in the region 
details on the loans by type are shown in table nine below 
the company s loan portfolio is largely trade related in nature and is relatively short term 
approximately percent of loans had maturities of less than one year 
additionally  the loan portfolio is an important source of liquidity since the company s predominant business  international trade finance  is self liquidating in nature and a significant part of the loans and extensions of credit mature within one year 
the term to maturity of the company s loans at december  are shown on table ten

these assets represent a customer s liability to the company while the company s corresponding liability to third parties is reflected on the balance sheet as bankers acceptances outstanding and deferred payment letters of credit outstanding 
deposits the primary sources of the company s domestic time deposits are its eight bank branches located in florida and one in puerto rico 
the company has three bank branches in miami  one each in tampa  winter haven  sarasota  west palm beach and weston 
in pricing its deposits  the company analyzes the market carefully  attempting to price its deposits competitively with the larger financial institutions in the area 
table two provides information on average deposit amounts and rates paid to each deposit category

other includes those countries in which contingencies represent less than percent of the company s total contingencies at each of the above dates 
these countries had contingencies  which did not exceed percent of the company s total contingencies as of the period indicated 
liquidity the company seeks to manage its assets and liabilities to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income that might result from changes in interest rates through systematic monitoring of maturity mismatches 
the company s investment decision making takes into account not only the rates of return and their underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  including minimum cash reserves  withdrawal and maturity of deposits and additional demand for funds 
for any given period  the pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice 
an excess of assets or liabilities over these matched items results in a gap or mismatch  as shown on table sixteen 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity and normally means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income while a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
however  because different types of assets and liabilities with similar maturities may reprice at different rates or may otherwise react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates may not necessarily have such effects on net interest income 
all of the company s assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars and therefore the company has no material foreign exchange risk 
cash and cash equivalents were million on december   a decrease from million from december  during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities was million and net cash provided by financing activities was million 
for further information on cash flows  see the consolidated statement of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s principal sources of liquidity and funding are its diverse deposit base and the sales of bankers acceptances as well as loan participations 
the level and maturity of deposits necessary to support the company s lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand and through its asset liability management process 
considerations in managing the company s liquidity position include  but are not limited to  scheduled cash flows from existing assets  contingencies and liabilities  as well as projected liquidity needs arising from anticipated extensions of credit 
furthermore  the liquidity position is monitored daily by management to maintain a level of liquidity conducive to efficient operations and is continuously evaluated as part of the asset liability management process 
historically  the company has increased its level of deposits to allow for its planned asset growth 
customer deposits have increased through the branch network  and private banking customers  as well as deposits related to the trade activity 
the majority of the company s deposits are short term and closely match the short term nature of the company s assets 
at december  interest earning assets maturing within days were million  representing percent of total earning assets 
the short term nature of the loan portfolio and the fact that a portion of the loan portfolio consists of bankers acceptances provides additional liquidity to the company 
liquid assets at december  were million  percent of total assets  and consisted of cash and cash equivalents  due from banks time and foreign debt securities 
at december  the company had been advised of million in available interbank funding 
table sixteen presents the projected maturities or interest rate adjustments of the company s earning assets and interest bearing funding sources based upon the contractual maturities or adjustment dates at december  the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company and the related interest rate sensitivity gap given in the following table may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods

in addition  although the company s credit losses have been relatively limited to date  management believes that the level of the company s allowance should reflect the potential for political and economic instability in certain countries of the region and the possibility that serious economic difficulties in a country could adversely affect all of the company s loans to borrowers in or doing business with that country 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses requires management s judgment  including application of the factors described above to assumptions and estimates made in the context of changing political and economic conditions in many of the countries of the region 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s current allowance for credit losses will prove to be adequate in light of future events and developments 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was approximately million  an increase of percent from million at december  this increase relates to the increase in provision for credit losses discussed earlier 
table seventeen provides certain information with respect to the company s allowance for credit losses  provision for credit losses and chargeoff and recovery activity for the periods shown

the company usually places an asset on nonaccrual status when any payment of principal or interest is over days past due or earlier if management determines the collection of principal or interest to be unlikely 
loans over days past due may not be placed on nonaccrual if they are in the process of collection and are either secured by property having a realizable value at least equal to the outstanding debt and accrued interest or are fully guaranteed by a financially responsible party whom the company believes is willing and able to discharge the debt  including accrued interest 
in most cases  if a borrower has more than one loan outstanding under its line with the company and any of its individual loans becomes over days past due  the company places all outstanding loans to that borrower on nonaccrual status 
the company does not have a rigid chargeoff policy but instead charges off loans on a case by case basis as determined by management and approved by the board of directors 
in some instances  loans may remain in the nonaccrual category for a period of time during which the borrower and the company negotiate restructured repayment terms 
the company attributes its consistent basis of asset quality to the short term nature of its loan portfolio  the composition of its borrower base  the importance that borrowers in the region attach to maintaining their continuing access to financing for foreign trade and to the company s loan underwriting policies 
the company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under these standards  individually identified impaired loans are measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received  using the historical effective loan rate as the discount rate 
alternatively  measurement may also be based on observable market prices or  for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment  measurement may be based on the fair value of the collateral 
the company evaluates commercial loans individually for impairment  while groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans generally residential mortgage and installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s nonperforming loans at the dates indicated 
total nonperforming loans to total loans increased when compared to historical levels as a result of additional loans entering the nonperforming category

 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
at december  and december  the company had no nonaccruing investment securities 
for the year ended december  the amount of interest income that was accrued on the loans in the previous table was approximately thousand 
for the year ended december  the amount of interest income that would have been accrued on the loans in the previous table in accordance with their contractual terms was approximately million  of which million represented interest income on foreign loans and thousand on domestic loans 
management does not believe that there is a material amount of loans not included in the foregoing table where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers would cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in such loans becoming nonaccruing loans 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  after adjustments for fair value accounting 
this increase was due primarily to million of retained earnings 
during the company paid dividends on preferred stock of thousand  which were within the amounts allowed by banking and holding company regulations 
the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
the regulations require the company and the bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tier i capital as defined in the regulations to total average assets as defined and minimum ratios of tier i and total capital as defined to risk weighted assets as defined 
the company was required by the occ to record  under protest  a transfer risk reserve of million related to the bank s exposure in ecuador 
this reserve was recorded for regulatory reporting purposes only and not for the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company is appealing  within the occ  this requirement 
note eight of the consolidated financial statements reports company and bank capital ratios 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management in the normal course of conducting business activities  the company is exposed to market risk which includes both price and liquidity risk 
the company s price risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates  and foreign exchange rates that may result in changes in values of financial instruments 
the company does not have material direct market risk related to commodity and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the company may not be able to satisfy current and future financial commitments or that the company may not be able to liquidate financial instruments at market prices 
risk management policies and procedures have been established and are utilized to manage the company s exposure to market risk 
the strategy of the company is to operate at an acceptable risk environment while maximizing its earnings 
market risk is managed by the asset liability committee which formulates and monitors the performance of the company based on established levels of market risk as dictated by policy 
in setting the tolerance levels of market risk  the committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital potential changes in the outlook in market rates  global and regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the company s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios 
it is the strategy of the company to maintain as neutral an interest rate risk position as possible 
by utilizing this strategy the company locks in a spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
given the matching strategy of the company and the fact that it does not maintain significant medium and or long term exposure positions  the company s interest rate risk will be measured and quantified through an interest rate sensitivity report 
for any given period  the company s pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice 
an excess of assets or liabilities over these matched items results in a gap or mismatch 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity and normally means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
on the other hand a negative gap denotes liability sensitivity and normally means that a decline in interest rates would have a positive effect in net interest income 
however  because different types of assets and liabilities with similar maturities may reprice at different rates or may otherwise react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates may not necessarily have such effects on net interest income 
table sixteen provides the company s interest rate sensitivity reports as of december  this table shows that interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded interest earning assets by million 
the company monitors that the assets and liabilities are closely matched to minimize interest rate risk 
on december  the interest rate risk position of the company was not significant since the impact of a basis point rise or fall of interest rates over the next months is estimated at percent of net income 
substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars  therefore the company has no material foreign exchange risk 
in addition  the company has no trading account securities  therefore it is not exposed to market risk resulting from trading activities 
note thirteen of the consolidated financial statements reports fair value of financial instruments 
as reported in this note  the carrying values approximate their fair values which generally minimizes the exposure to market risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
this minimal risk is the result of the short term nature of the company s interest earning assets and the matching maturity level of the interest bearing liabilities 
on a daily basis the bank s chief financial officer and the bank s treasurer are responsible for measuring and managing market risk
