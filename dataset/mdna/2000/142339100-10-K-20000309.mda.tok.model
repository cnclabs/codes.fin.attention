item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
carlisle companies incorporated reported sales of billion in  up  or million  from sales of billion 
the primary contributing factor to this increase was generated through product line expansion and market share gains 
in addition  we completed several complementary acquisitions in and in  sales increased or million  as a result of internal growth as well as acquisitions made in and the full year impact of those acquisitions completed in net earnings in were million  or per share  a increase over net earnings of million  or per share 
net earnings  in  increased  reflecting not only the increased sales levels  but also cost reductions 
in january  carlisle exited its perishable cargo business  which impacts the year to year comparisons of operating results 
after adjusting for the effect of this divestiture  pro forma sales and net earnings increased and  respectively 
the quarterly pro forma results are shown in table below 
table pro forma sales millions without as reported perishable cargo operation change change first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total     net earnings millions pro forma without as reported perishable cargo operation change change first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total sales and net earnings in mark the eighth consecutive year of year to year improvements 
approximately of this year s growth came from the combination of market growth  product line extensions  market share gains and cost reductions 
the strong rebound in the automotive market  the expansion of sales of insulation and thermoplastic polyolefin tpo roofing membrane  as well as strong growth in our specialty tire and wheel  systems and equipment  and foodservices businesses are the primary contributors to our sales increase 
improved operational efficiencies at several operations  along with sales increases  account for the increased earnings from internal operations 
continuing progress was made on the program to improve the profitability of assets employed in the business 
the effective tax rate was reduced from to 
this reduction was the result of the implementation of various state tax strategies initiated over the last two years 
during  we completed five complementary acquisitions 
we purchased global manufacturing  a manufacturer of stamped steel wheels for industrial and recreational applications and styled steel wheels for the automotive aftermarket johnson truck bodies  a manufacturer of fiber glass custom truck bodies for the delivery of food products to stores and homes  innovative engineering limited  an engineering and equipment supplier of cheese making systems  marko international  inc  a supplier of table coverings  table skirtings and other accessories for the foodservice market  and the custom steel wheel business of cragar industries  inc  which produces and markets cragar brand custom steel wheels to the automotive aftermarket 
four acquisitions were completed in vermont electromagnetics and quality microwave interconnects  inc  both manufacturers of specialty cable assemblies and connectors  industrial tire products  inc  a distributor of industrial and recreational tire and wheel assemblies  and hardcast europe bv  a dutch manufacturer of adhesive and sealant products for the construction market 
operating segments construction materials segment sales grew in to million  an increase of million over sales of million 
this sales growth resulted from the expansion of insulation and thermoplastic polyolefin tpo shipments to the roofing systems market by carlisle syntec 
carlisle coatings waterproofing experienced higher sales driven by its tape and sealant products 
in  segment sales increased from sales of million as a result of increased market share and new products 
segment earnings were up in to million  reflecting increased sales levels  improved operational performance and favorable warranty experience  partially offset by the absorption of increased raw material costs and changes in product mix 
also  during  carlisle syntec successfully implemented an integrated company wide information system  which will further improve the efficiencies of this segment 
the segment earnings of million were up over segment earnings of million  primarily due to increased sales 
return on assets improved from to as a result of both increased asset efficiency and profit margins 
industrial components segment sales were million in  a increase over sales of million 
the primary cause of the increase was the growth of new customers and new products in the specialty tire and wheel business of carlisle tire wheel  as well as acquisitions that were completed in and decreased customer requirements for aerospace bulk cable negatively impacted tensolite s sales 
sales at motion control industries and carlisle industrial brake friction were down in  due to lower demand in the heavy duty friction aftermarket and off highway industrial brakes for mining and agricultural applications 
in  segment sales increased over sales of million 
the primary cause of this increase was the growth of tire and wheel assemblies  especially to the aftermarket  increased shipment of high performance wire to aircraft manufacturers  and the acquisition of two high speed data cable assembly companies 
segment earnings increased to million in the main factors in the increase were product line extension and operational improvements at our specialty tire and wheel businesses 
offsetting these improvements were lower earnings at our specialty wire and cable business and carlisle industrial brake friction due to less robust markets 
in  segment earnings of million increased over segment earnings of million 
this earnings growth was consistent with the increase in sales 
return on assets in increased to from in automotive components in  segment sales increased to million over sales of million 
this growth was the result of a very strong automotive and light truck market coupled with new product introductions 
segment sales were up in  over sales of million 
this increase was due to product line extensions  which were offset by the effects of the general motors gm strike 
segment earnings of million represent an increase of over segment earnings of million 
earnings in increased due to the impact of the gm strike in as well as improved product mix 
in the fourth quarter  this business was streamlined and an unprofitable operation eliminated 
earnings in decreased from the level of million due primarily to the inefficiencies generated by the rapid ramp up of production for new programs interrupted by the gm strike in return on assets improved from in to in as asset efficiency increased and profit margins improved 
general industry all other the general industry all other segment sales of million were flat with sales of million 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the effect of the perishable cargo divestiture in january  sales increased over sales and earnings at carlisle systems equipment account for much of this pro forma increase  due to the acquisition of johnson truck bodies as well as internal growth 
carlisle transportation products sales were up over primarily due to a strong highway construction market 
higher sales were recorded in our foodservice business due to product line expansions in both international and domestic markets 
carlisle foodservice products completed the significant upgrade of a new customer service system  as well as opening two new distribution facilities 
segment sales in were up over sales of million 
this increase was related to higher sales of specialty trailers to construction markets  plastic permanentware to the foodservice industry and refrigerated containers to the shipping industry 
segment earnings of million increased over segment earnings of million 
pro forma earnings grew  after excluding the perishable cargo business  reflecting primarily the increase in sales in this segment 
earnings in were up over earnings of million 
this growth was due to the general increase in sales  improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased share of the leasing market in our perishable cargo business 
return on assets increased to in  from in  as a result of improved profit margins 
financial results gross margin  expressed as a percent of sales  represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
these margins declined from of sales in to in  and increased to in the decline from to largely reflects the competitive marketplace and changing mix in carlisle s total sales 
in  improved operational efficiency  as well as improved product mix  accounted for the higher margin rate 
selling and administrative costs  expressed as a percent of sales  declined from in to in  but increased to in  reflecting the continued emphasis on cost control throughout all operations and lower cost structures in carlisle s overall businesses 
total costs  which include raw material  manufacturing  selling  general and administrative costs  expressed as a percentage of total sales  have remained fairly consistent  decreasing slightly in to of sales from of sales in and of sales in the improvement in this total cost relationship in was due to improved operating efficiencies 
the decline from s level of percent of sales was due to operational improvements offset by the gm strike and the change in product mix in the construction materials operations 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in  due to the lower debt levels maintained throughout the year 
planned capital expenditures and acquisitions were financed through internally generated cash flows 
other  net decreased to million in due to the reduction of the company s ownership in its leasing joint venture

the level of receivables represented a increase over levels and was primarily the result of higher december sales 
inventories  valued primarily by the last in  first out lifo method  were million at year end  a increase over the year end level of million 
the increase in inventory at year end was primarily due to higher inventory at specialty tire and wheel and roofing operations in preparation for the spring selling season  as well as from acquisitions made during the current year 
the inventory level increased over  due primarily to acquisitions made during the year 
capital expenditures totaled million in  a significant reduction from the million incurred in the level was more consistent with previous levels  which reflects a normalized level of capital spending 
the increase was primarily attributable to investments in production capacity in mexico  expanded warehousing and distribution facilities for our foodservice operation  increased production capacity for tire and wheel assemblies  specialty trailer products  high speed data wire and cable assemblies  and plant and equipment to manufacture insulation and tpo roofing membranes 
liquidity  capital resources and environmental cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in cash used in investing activities was million versus million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was attributable to cash received from the divestiture of the perishable cargo business  net of a million tax payment  as well as a reduction in the level of capital expenditures 
the net cash used in financing activities in was million versus cash provided of million in the amount reflects the repayment of short term borrowings  outstanding at the end of  and dividend payments 
the net cash provided by financing activities in  of million  reflects the net increase in debt after the early payment of higher cost debt and stock repurchases 
carlisle has a million revolving credit facility available for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
in may  carlisle issued to the public million of ten year bonds at a rate of 
the net proceeds from these bonds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and to fund other needs throughout the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity 
carlisle continues to maintain substantial flexibility to meet anticipated needs for liquidity and investment opportunities 
carlisle management recognizes the importance of the company s responsibilities toward matters of environmental concern 
programs are in place to monitor and test facilities and surrounding environments and  where practical  to recycle materials 
carlisle has not incurred material charges relating to environmental matters in or in prior years  and none are currently anticipated 
year during the last several years  and in the normal course of business  carlisle has replaced a substantial portion of its older computer software and systems with new systems that are year compliant 
these investments are expected to assist carlisle in improving its operational ratios 
with respect to the remaining information systems  as well as the company s embedded technology  the company adopted a program involving both internal personnel and third party consultants of i assessment  ii remediation  and iii authentication 
the company has completed the assessment phase  the remediation phase  and the authentication phase  which included simulated testing in a year environment 
the company will continue testing its systems throughout the first quarter of the cost to the company  of completing these efforts did not exceed  carlisle has maintained a formal communication program with its significant suppliers and large customers  which it will conclude in the first quarter of as part of this program  carlisle has  and will continue to evaluate the supplier s year compliance plans and state of readiness and determine whether a year related event will impede the ability of a particular supplier to continue to provide goods and services 
contingency plans were adopted for any significant supplier that did not provide an appropriate and timely response to carlisle or if the results of a risk assessment identified a business process at risk of a year failure 
there were no disruptions to carlisle businesses as a result of the changeover to the year however  there can be no guarantee that year failures experienced by third parties during the first quarter of would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operations 
backlog and future outlook backlog was million at december  compared to million excluding carlisle perishable cargo backlog of million in higher backlog at carlisle systems equipment and carlisle foodservice reflects the strong market penetration achieved by these businesses 
automotive components backlog was down from december due to the high demand in the fourth quarter  created by the gm strike 
also  construction materials backlog was down due to reporting enhancements made in conjunction with the implementation of new business software 
the elimination of capacity limitations  through significant capital expenditures in and the continued implementation of lean manufacturing systems  allowed more rapid response to customer needs and contributed to backlog reductions in several businesses 
reduced aerospace wire demand is reflected in the lower backlog 
we continue to concentrate on our longstanding operating principles of targeted market leadership  growth from within  lean organizational structure  low cost  decentralized operations  and strategic acquisitions to achieve our sales and earnings growth objectives 
as we move ahead  we are confident that adherence to these principles will bring continued operating success 
with a growing market and a commitment to constant increased operating efficiency  should prove to be another strong year for carlisle
