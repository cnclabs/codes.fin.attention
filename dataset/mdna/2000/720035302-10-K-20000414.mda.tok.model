year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue of  decreased  or  from prior year levels 
lower average selling prices and changes in the videoconferencing products sales mix to more products at the lower end of the product line principally account for the decline 
the company s revenue from sales to foreign markets was approximately and of total revenue in and  respectively 
the company expects that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenue 
revenue from sales to foreign markets was principally comprised of sales originating in the united states of  the united kingdom of  and japan of  revenue from sales to foreign markets in were principally comprised of sales originating in the united states of  the united kingdom of  and japan of  gross margin 
overall gross margin decreased  or  to  in versus gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in both declines were primarily caused by lower average selling prices coupled with increased relative sales of lower margin products in the videoconferencing products segment 
higher videoconferencing services costs also contributed to the lower gross margin performance 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from but increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
a headcount decrease  partially offset by  of severance and related expense   settlement cost of shareholder litigation  and  related to subleasing excess real estate  is responsible for the lower dollar expenses 
research and development expenses of  were essentially the same as in and represented and of revenue for and  respectively 
research and development expenditures  prior to the capitalization of software costs  were  in  or of revenue 
the company capitalized software costs of  in  excluding completed technology purchased as part of the starlight acquisition 
no such costs were capitalized in  as no current projects in progress had achieved technological feasibility 
videoconferencing products 
the videoconferencing products segment develops  manufactures and markets visual communications systems and collaboration software 
videoconferencing products scale from personal desktop systems to large conference room solutions 
additionally  the segment markets a wide range of network infrastructure products and peripheral devices 
videoconferencing product revenue decreased to  in from  in the decrease can be attributed to lower average selling prices and significant changes in product sales mix 
trends toward lower average selling prices are expected to continue in response to increased competition 
shifts in sales mix from large room systems such as the concorde and venue product lines to compact class room systems  such as swiftsite ii and intel teamstation system  continued in traditional large room systems represented of total room system sales in compared with in overall unit sales grew only versus the prior year with room systems increasing and personal systems decreasing 
revenue was further impacted by a delay in releasing swiftsite ii  a next generation compact room system  until the second quarter of  and lower investment in legacy product features and functionality 
significant resources have been redirected to next generation 
table of contents products being jointly developed with intel corporation that are scheduled for release starting in the second quarter of the videoconferencing products segment generated an operating loss of  in compared to a  operating loss in significant charges of  and  are included in the and losses  respectively 
severance and other workforce reduction related costs account for the charges 
the charges included  for incomplete technology acquired in connection with the november acquisition of starlight networks plus  related to the write down of inventory and capitalized software to their net realizable value plus other costs associated with discontinuance of a video network server product line 
absent these charges the videoconferencing product segment operating losses would have been  in versus  in lower revenue  decreased software development cost capitalization  capitalized software amortization related to swiftsite ii  and amortization of goodwill and completed technology purchased as part of the starlight acquisition were the primary contributors to the earnings decline 
ongoing operating expenses excluding capitalized software decreased approximately versus as segment headcount was reduced by nearly during the year in response to lower revenue expectations 
gross margin was in excluding charges compared with a figure of 
videoconferencing services 
the videoconferencing services segment provides maintenance as well as professional consulting and management services for videoconferencing products sold by the company and its competitors 
segment revenue increased from  in to  in maintenance revenue was higher than the prior year while professional services increased 
the professional services growth came largely from managing multipoint videoconferences for customers and from custom product integration sales and services 
operating profits were  in  which represents a decrease from the prior year s  figure 
higher average costs for contracted services  increased provision for spare parts obsolescence  higher selling expenses  and development costs associated with new service offerings are responsible 
audioconferencing multilink 
the audioconferencing segment develops  manufactures  markets and services multipoint audio control units 
segment revenue decreased  or  from to  in this decrease relates to the delayed introduction of multilink s next generation product line  the system  which occurred in december the segment recorded a  operating loss during compared to a  operating profit the previous year 
charges of  related to the july sublease of multilink s former facility at riverside drive in andover  massachusetts are included in s results 
decreased revenue and sharply increased research and development spending on enhancing current products and developing next generation products are the other major factors responsible for the profitability decline 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
the company s revenue decreased  or  in from s  level 
the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of decreased unit shipments of videoconferencing products offset by increased videoconferencing services revenue 
sales to foreign markets accounted for approximately of total revenue in both and revenue from sales to foreign markets in were principally comprised of sales originating in the united states of  the united kingdom of  and japan of  revenue from sales to foreign markets in was principally comprised of sales originating in the united states of  the united kingdom of  and japan of  gross margin 
the company s gross margin of  decreased  or  compared to gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased due to decreased significant charges included in cost of revenue for the videoconferencing products segment in versus  as discussed below

research and development expenses decreased  or  in from and were and of revenue for 
table of contents and  respectively 
research and development expenditures  prior to the capitalization of software costs  were  in and  in  or and of revenue  respectively 
the company capitalized software costs of  in  excluding completed starlight technology  and  in these amounts represent and of aggregate research and development expenditures for and  respectively 
as discussed below  total operating expenses decreased by  year over year due to a decrease in significant charges included in videoconferencing products and audioconferencing segment results as well as efforts by management to reduce the company s overall cost structure through headcount and program reductions 
videoconferencing products 
segment revenue fell  or  to  in compared to  with a decline in overall videoconferencing system unit volume primarily responsible for the decrease 
group system shipments were down  mainly in the concorde and swiftsite lines  while desktop personal system shipments decreased 
network server product volume  which is driven largely by group and desktop personal shipments  also declined 
average selling prices were generally lower across all products compared to  but a shift in mix towards higher priced group and associated network products kept overall average selling prices nearly flat 
delayed introduction of swiftsite ii  the company s successor compact system to swiftsite i  from the fourth quarter of to the second quarter of accounted for much of the group systems volume decline and the favorable mix as higher priced systems made up a larger proportion of revenue 
the videoconferencing products segment generated a  operating loss during compared to a  loss the previous year 
the losses for both years include significant charges  with  of the  operating loss reduction from to resulting from lower charges in the charges totaled  as discussed previously 
charges of  are included in the loss and include  for various write downs of excess and obsolete inventory   for capitalized software costs impaired as a result of canceled development projects   for product retrofit accruals   for severance charges and office closings   for advances to vertical partners written off to reflect changing business conditions and shifts in distribution channels and to write off other assets associated with the canceled development projects 
absent these significant charges  the videoconferencing product segment operating loss would have been  in compared to a  loss the previous year 
for  an reduction in research and development expenditures along with an reduction in other operating expenses due to management s efforts to reduce the company s overall cost structure more than offset a gross margin decline caused by the lower segment revenue 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was approximately in both years excluding charges 
videoconferencing services 
segment revenue increased from  in to  in growth in professional service revenue  particularly from managing multipoint videoconferences for customers  was primarily responsible for the increase 
operating profits were  in  which represents a increase over the prior year s  figure 
higher revenue and lower field operating expense account for the improvement 
audioconferencing 
segment revenue decreased  or  from prior year levels to  in a decrease in average selling prices that was partially offset by increased unit shipments accounted for the decrease 
the segment generated  of operating profit during compared to a  operating loss the previous year 
operating expenses in included  for investment banking and other advisory fees recorded when the company acquired multilink as well as  to establish accruals for severance  sales tax and benefit liabilities 
the loss would have been without these charges 
the year over year profitability improvement between and was driven largely by reductions in research and development and sales expenses due to lower headcount 
gross margin improved versus  despite lower revenue  as a result of improved service profitability 

table of contents other net interest income expense 
the company had net interest expense of in compared with net interest income of  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from lower invested cash balances and a full year of interest expense on the minuteman facility s capital lease

other income expense 
other income of  in consists principally of net gains on foreign currency transactions and a  gain from the third quarter sale of realnetwork shares acquired through an investment in a company later acquired by realnetworks 
net gains on foreign currency transactions are also the primary component of s other income of  both and figures also include net sublease income related to the minuteman facility 
other expenses of  in consisted primarily of a  write off of an equity investment offset by net gains on foreign currency transactions and net gains on sales of securities 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for  and was   and  respectively 
the and rates differ from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
due to uncertainty surrounding the company s ability to fully realize deferred tax assets  picturetel established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in and recognized no deferred tax benefits in and the rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign taxes offset by research and development tax credits and increased valuation allowances related to certain current year tax credits and net operating losses whose benefits are uncertain

capital spending of  in included leasehold improvements at the minuteman facility while internal software development  securities purchases  and the starlight acquisition are responsible for the balance of the investing cash usage 
financing activities generated  of cash in  with the principal source being  of cash from the issuance of convertible preferred stock to intel corporation 
principal payments on capital leases were the major use of cash 
financing activities used  of cash in  primarily to pay principal on capital leases 
cash utilization is of major concern to the company 
to reduce this usage  the company has restructured several areas  reduced staffing  intensified programs to reduce working capital  and curtailed capital spending

the revolving credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all 
table of contents assets of the parent company and certain stock of its subsidiaries 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants  including net income loss and minimum cash requirements 
the company is retroactively in compliance with these covenants after receiving a waiver for not meeting its fourth quarter net income requirement

the required collateral was  as of december  we have received a report from our independent accountants containing an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses and requirement for additional financing raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
moreover  management s plans to continue as a going concern rely heavily on forecasted revenue from new products being jointly developed with intel corporation  new multi media applications services  and enhanced compact videoconferencing systems  all of which are planned for delivery commencing in the second quarter of under generally accepted auditing standards  the company s auditors have concluded that they are unable to rely on future revenue from these new products and services in evaluating the achievability of management s plan to continue as a going concern 
in addition to the revenue plan  management is currently negotiating an expanded credit facility and may seek additional equity investment 
management is also continuing to identify and implement internal actions to improve the company s liquidity

the industry standards for such new technologies and networks  however  are still in the early stages of development  which the company believes has led to customer uncertainty and  accordingly  a slowdown in the growth of the general market for videoconferencing products 
as a result of customer preferences  the company continues to experience a shift in its sales model to videoconferencing systems with lower average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing cost reductions for all of its products or in developing and marketing suitable new products and related services with attractive margins for these new technologies and networks 
the possible transition  migration and or convergence of technologies is difficult to predict and could have profound implications for the industry and the business of the company 
further  there is significant risk that existing products could be rendered obsolete due to changing technology 
the company s failure to develop and market new products on a timely basis or to enhance its existing products or to respond effectively to technological changes  new industry standards or product announcements by competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
this increased competition resulting from such partnerships and acquisitions  together with mergers among competitors and a slowdown in the growth of the general market for visual collaboration products  has led and may continue to lead to increases in the defection or dilution of picturetel s distribution channel partners to competitors  decreases in average selling prices and margins in both group and desktop visual collaboration systems  and a lower segment market share by picturetel for products and services in the emerging area of network based visual collaboration 
in some cases  picturetel competes with its channel partners for various services  which increases the complexity of channel management 
in addition  competitors may offer network based visual collaboration software solutions or incorporate standard algorithms into processor chips free of additional charge  which may reduce the value picturetel technology provides to the market  especially in its lower end visual collaboration products 
in addition  the prices which picturetel is able to charge for its visual collaboration products and services may further decrease from historical levels as a result of new product introductions by competitors  price competition  technological advances  or otherwise 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on picturetel s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing 
certain key subassemblies and products are currently available only from one vendor and several vendors are smaller corporations with limited financial resources that could prove to be inadequate 
in some cases components are sourced from only one vendor  even where multiple sources are available  to maintain quality control and enhance the working relationship with the vendor 
in addition  the company from time to time enters into development arrangements with third parties to develop and incorporate new features and functions into the company s products 
failure of these third parties to fulfill their respective obligations under these development arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business could also be adversely affected by delays or interruptions in delivery  and poor quality of supplies  subassemblies or products from key vendors 
in addition  the company designs and procures certain circuits  components and subassemblies from non videoconferencing divisions of its competitors  such as sony and panasonic corporation 
the failure to obtain adequate supplies or the requirement to redesign and source supplies from another manufacturer may take substantial time and result in significant expense  each of which could adversely impact product shipments and materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
recent history of losses 
the company s revenue decreased during as compared to and decreased between and losses from operations were   and  in  and  respectively 
on april   the company announced that it expects consolidated first quarter revenue to be between and million with a corresponding net loss of between and per share 
continued negative operating results could adversely impact the company s relationship with customers  vendors and employees  as well as its liquidity and ability to remain in compliance with covenants under its revolving credit agreement 
we have received a report from our independent accountants containing 
table of contents an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses and requirement for additional financing raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans to continue as a going concern rely heavily on forecasted revenue from new products being jointly developed with intel corporation  new multi media applications services  and enhanced compact videoconferencing systems 
there can be no guarantee that such revenue increase will occur or will be sufficient to meet the company s needs 
in addition to the revenue plan  management is currently negotiating an expanded credit facility and may seek additional equity investment 
however  there is no guarantee that either of these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will be sufficient to meet the company s needs 
product protection and intellectual property 
the company s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
the company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
in absence of broad patent protection  which is not likely  and despite the company s reliance upon its proprietary confidential information  competitors of the company have been able to use algorithms  or other features similar to those used by the company  to design and manufacture products that are directly competitive with the company s products 
the company believes that due to the rapid pace of technological change in the visual collaboration industry  legal protection for its products is less significant than factors such as the company s use  implementation and enhancement of standards based open architecture and the company s ongoing efforts in product innovation 
although the company does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against the company from time to time 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against the company in the future or that such claims will not be successful 
the company could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
potential fluctuations of quarterly operating results 
the majority of the company s revenues in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter  and a substantial portion of the company s orders and shipments typically occur during the last weeks of each quarter such that forecasting of revenue and product mix is both complex and difficult 
unanticipated variations in the timing of receipt of customer orders in any quarter may produce significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues 
as a result  a shortfall in revenue compared to internal expectations may not evidence itself until late in the quarter and any resulting impact on earnings may not be determinable until several weeks after the end of the quarter 
the company s ability to maintain or increase net revenues depends upon its ability to increase unit volume sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or to maintain the current level of unit volume sales 
other factors which may cause period to period fluctuations in operational results include the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product mix of sales  changes in the relative proportions of sales among distribution channels or among customers within each distribution channel  changes in manufacturing costs  and general economic factors such as the recent decline of currency values in the asian markets 
international operations 
revenue related to international operations of the company totaled approximately  and of total revenues for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
management of the company expects international revenues to continue to constitute a significant portion of total revenues in future periods 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products and  to the extent the company is unable to do so  its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company s sales to international distributors are denominated in us dollars in order to minimize risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency rates 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  however  could make the company s product more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
sales by the company s foreign subsidiaries are generally made in the foreign subsidiary s local currency  in which case fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to such other currencies could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
currently  the company employs various currency hedging strategies to reduce these risks 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from asian markets 
given the 
table of contents current general weakness in the asian markets  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current revenue levels or growth in such markets 
there can be no assurance that the above factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology corporations  the market price of picturetel common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company and by its competitors  changes in the mix of products and sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology corporations and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such corporations 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of picturetel common stock in any given period 
dependence on key personnel 
on august   the company announced that dr 
norman gaut had succeeded bruce r 
bond as chairman of the board  ceo and president of the company 
in february  mr 
bond succeeded dr 
gaut as chief executive officer and president  and had been elected chairman of the board in june at that time  dr 
gaut had retired as an active employee while remaining a member of the board of directors 
dr 
gaut accepted this position at a difficult time for the company and there is no assurance that this transition will be successful 
the company depends on a limited number of key senior management personnel  including norman gaut  arthur fatum  vice president and cfo  david grainger  group vice president and general manager of services  timothy duffy  group vice president and general manager of conferencing products  robert byrnes  group vice president for emerging products  lawrence bornstein  vice president  human resources  and john nye  president and general manager  multilink 
there has been and continues to be considerable turnover in the company s senior management team over the past several years  and the loss of the services of one or more of the company s senior management team or the inability to attract  retain  motivate and manage additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or operating results of the company 
in addition  the company continues to experience an increase in voluntary employee attrition from engineering and other departments 
there is no assurance  given the competitive nature of the current job market  that the company will be able to adequately fill the open positions 
year compliance 
in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
euro 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and established the euro  making the euro their common legal currency on that date 
based on a recent assessment  the euro conversion is not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company and its subsidiaries face exposures to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
the company s primary currency exposure 
table of contents has been related to foreign currency denominated receivables and receivables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
historically  the company has hedged currency exposures associated with foreign currency denominated receivables by entering into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against the foreign currency receivable transaction 
forward contracts generally have a maturity date within four to six months of the contract date 
the goal of the company s hedging activity is to minimize the exposures inherent in these transactions 
the company s hedging activities minimize the company s exchange rate risk because the gains and losses on these contracts offset the losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 
the criteria the company uses for designating a forward contract as a hedge include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of the forward contract to the underlying transaction 
the following table represents hypothetical changes in fair value in the company s foreign currency forward contracts 
the modeling technique measures the fair value of the forward contract by currency type arising from potential changes in foreign currency rates

the company s primary market risk exposure for its investments relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
as a result  the company does not hedge these interest rate exposures
