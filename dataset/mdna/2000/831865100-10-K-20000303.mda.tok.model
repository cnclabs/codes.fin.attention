the company purchased magnetek  inc s worldwide motor operations for million in the third quarter of in connection with the magnetek motors acquisition  additional purchase liabilities of million were recorded which included employee severance and relocation  as well as certain facility exit costs 
the reduction in cash and cash equivalents of million during  as well as the majority of the increases in accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable  were primarily attributable to the acquisition 
in addition  electric motor technologies inventories increased in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of higher customer demand in the first quarter of working capital declined in primarily as a result of the decline in cash and equivalents associated with the million acquisition of general electric s compressor motor business 
capital expenditures of continuing operations were million in compared with million in and million in the increase in capital spending during occurred in the company s electric motors operation 
the company is projecting capital expenditures of approximately to million 
the increase over historical expenditures is due to the magnetek motors acquisition 
cash flow from continuing operations is expected to adequately cover these capital expenditures 
long term debt increased million from million at december   to million at december   primarily as a result of the magnetek motors acquisition 
additionally  the company s leverage  as measured by total debt to total capital  increased to percent at the end of compared with percent at the end of in conjunction with the acquisition  the company terminated its existing million  multi year credit facility and established a new million  five year revolving credit facility and a million  day revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks 
barring any acquisitions  the company expects the combination of cash flow and the previously announced sale of the storage and fluid handling businesses will result in a significantly lower leverage ratio at the end of the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during under its stock repurchase program 
since the program s inception in january  approximately million shares have been repurchased

a 
o 
smith corporation has paid dividends for consecutive years 
the company paid a total of 
per share in versus 
per share in results of operations sales from continuing operations in were billion  surpassing sales of million by million or percent 
approximately million of the increase was related to acquisition activities within the electric motors business during the past two years with another million attributable to the inclusion of sales for the water heater operation in china which became wholly owned in december the remaining growth occurred in the company s core electric motor and water heater businesses 
sales from continuing operations in increased approximately million compared with sales due mostly to the mid acquisition of the hermetic compressor motor business and a full year of sales from the subfractional motor business acquired in march on january   the company announced its intent to exit the storage tank and fiberglass pipe markets 
this decision is consistent with the company s commitment to an expanded presence in the electric motor and water products markets and the strategy to become a consolidator in these industries 
as a result of the anticipated sale of these businesses  smith fiberglass products company and a 
o 
smith engineered storage products company have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s gross profit margin for was percent  compared with the percent and percent gross margins achieved in and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin resulted from the previously discussed acquisitions and the chinese water heater operation which carry lower margins than the base motors and water heater businesses 
the decrease in gross margin from to was due to the previously discussed subfractional and hermetic compressor motor acquisitions 
sales for the electric motor technologies segment in increased million or over percent to a record million from sales of million 
sales in were million 
the acquisition of the magnetek motors business on august   added approximately million in sales while the hermetic compressor motor business acquired mid year contributed approximately million to sales during the first half of stronger sales of hermetic motors and fractional motors for heating  ventilating  and air conditioning hvac applications accounted for most of the remaining improvement in sales as the air conditioning industry experienced a good year in most of the increase in sales from to was due to the previously mentioned subfractional and hermetic compressor motor acquisitions 
sales in were also bolstered by a recovery in the hermetic motor business resulting from improvement in the hvac industry 
earnings for the electric motor technologies segment in increased to a record million or almost percent higher than the million earned in earnings in were million 
the favorable trend in earnings resulted primarily from the higher sales volume due to acquisitions and growth in the base electric motor business 
sales for water systems technologies increased million from million in to million in sales in were million 
this segment s chinese operation became wholly owned in december  and accordingly  million of sales for this entity have been included in higher commercial product and other international sales accounted for the balance of the increase 
earnings for water systems technologies were million in  reflecting improvement over and earnings of million and million  respectively 
much of the earnings improvement was due to higher gross margins in resulting from favorable cost performance 
as previously mentioned  the company announced its intent to divest the smith fiberglass products and engineered storage products companies 
sales for these discontinued operations declined from million in to million in  with a further decline to million in pricing related weakness in the petroleum production and chemical markets over the past few years resulted in reduced capital spending and an associated reduction in demand for storage tanks and fiberglass pipe 
the discontinued businesses of smith fiberglass products and engineered storage products generated a loss from operations equivalent to 
per share in compared with earnings of 
and 
in and  respectively 
the company recorded an after tax charge of approximately million to cover the estimated costs associated with the disposition of these businesses 
the total loss from discontinued operations was 
per share in the company expects its divestitures to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of the total earnings from discontinued operations in included per share associated with the sale of the automotive products company in april selling  general  and administrative sg a expense in was million  a million increase over the million recorded in the increase in expense is due to the additional sg a associated with the magnetek motors acquisition and the initial consolidation of the chinese water products operation 
sg a in remained fairly consistent with the million recorded in relative to sales  sg a dropped steadily from percent in to percent in the decline in sg a relative to sales reflects synergies associated with the previously discussed hermetic compressor motor acquisition 
interest expense  net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations  was million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the higher interest expense was the result of incurring additional debt to finance the magnetek motors acquisition 
the decline in interest expense from to was a function of slightly lower interest rates and greater amounts of capitalized interest associated with major plant and equipment expenditures 
interest income declined from million in to million in and million in as marketable securities were liquidated during the period to repurchase shares of common stock and to fund the million compressor motor acquisition 
a further decline in interest income occurred in as the remaining securities were liquidated to fund a portion of the magnetek motors acquisition 
other expense was million in and was significantly higher than the previous two years due mostly to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the company s recent acquisitions 
the company s effective tax rate over the past three years has averaged percent and has been relatively consistent 
the differential from the statutory rate was due primarily to the utilization of state tax loss carry forwards associated with liquidated subsidiaries and research and development tax credits 
outlook the company has a number of important objectives in place for completing the divestitures announced in january will continue to receive significant attention until those objectives are completed 
completion is expected before the end of the third quarter 
the electric motor technologies platform will continue to integrate the magnetek motors acquisition  leveraging cost savings from materials  sg a  and plant rationalization 
the company continues to project the incremental earnings of 
to 
per share in as forecasted at the time of the acquisition 
consolidation opportunities in both commercial and residential markets for water systems technologies will continue to be explored 
losses in the company s operation in china are projected to decline as sales growth continues to accelerate 
on a consolidated basis  the company projects sales will surpass billion and earnings growth will exceed the stated target of percent 
other matters year during  the company completed its efforts to address any potential year issues 
as a result of company wide efforts  a 
o 
smith corporation experienced no business issues with respect to the commencement of key customers  vendors  and service providers have performed normally early in and the company does not anticipate any future material adverse effect on its business operations  products  or financial prospects 
costs specifically associated with renovating software for year readiness were funded through operating cash flows and were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
environmental the company s operations are governed by a number of federal  state  and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials  the discharge of pollutants into the environment  and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties 
the company has expended substantial financial and managerial resources complying with such laws 
expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in and are not expected to be material in any single year 
although the company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to maintain compliance  there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future 
however  since the same laws govern the company s competitors  the company should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
market risk the company is exposed to various types of market risks  primarily currency and certain commodities 
the company monitors its risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enters into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year 
the company does not engage in speculation in its derivatives strategies 
further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations 
the company uses futures contracts to fix the cost of its expected needs with the objective of reducing price risk 
futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage 
at december   the company had commodity futures contracts amounting to approximately million of commodity purchases 
a hypothetical percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of million 
it is important to note that gains and losses from the company s futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 
in addition  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
at december   the company had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical percent movement in the respective currencies  the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to million 
it is important to note that gains and losses from the company s forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 
the company s earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are determined by short term money market rates 
at december   the company had million in outstanding floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of percent at year end 
a hypothetical percent annual increase or decrease in the year end average cost of the company s outstanding floating rate debt would result in a change in annual pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the company believes  anticipates  expects  projects  or words of similar import 
although the company believes that its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business  there can be no assurance that its financial goals will be realized 
although a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from the replacement of previously installed product  and such sales are therefore less volatile  numerous factors may affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company considers most important among such factors  the stability in its electric motor and water products markets  the timely and proper integration of the magnetek motors acquisition  and the implementation of associated cost reduction programs 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company  or persons acting on its behalf  are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements
