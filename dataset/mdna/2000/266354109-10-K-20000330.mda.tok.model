the elimination of the spending on cenestin sales  marketing and promotion will result in a material improvement in the company s operating performance in the first quarter of management believes that a combination of reduced spending levels resulting from the company s agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  and its projection of revenue levels  could be sufficient to position the company for profitability in the second quarter of the company s ability to attain profitability  the time frame required to do so  and the potential level of such profitability  are dependent upon a number of factors including the rate at which cenestin penetrates the ert market  the successful commercialization of apri and other products recently approved by the fda  development of additional potential sources of revenue  the profit level generated from the company s current business base including the level of revenue received under the company s agreement with warner lambert  and the level of spending on clinical and bioequivalency studies

net sales of the baseline products decreased by million in compared with the decline was primarily attributable to price erosion on certain of the company s existing products 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to shipment of products sourced from other manufacturers that were in a backorder status at december  and the contribution from newly approved products offset by a decline in revenues from the company s methylprednisolone product and lower revenue from several products for which the company instituted price increases late in the second quarter of while the adjustment to the selling price of those selected low margin products reduced unit sales volume  the action resulted in improving margins

see analysis of cash flows operating activities for information relating to cenestin shipments to date and deferred revenue 
in keeping with the company s revenue recognition policy  approximately million in sales of cenestin was recognized in the fourth quarter of  based on end user prescription data 
management believes the company s approach to revenue recognition for cenestin is appropriate due to the limited time cenestin has been promoted by the joint solvay pharmaceuticals duramed sales force  the fact that cenestin is duramed s first introduction of a brand product  the more than  sample packages that have been supplied to the sales force and the large pipeline fill of cenestin 
management believes that cenestin has the potential to become a market leader in the ert market and will become a significant component of the company s total sales

the company expects gross margin to increase in with the anticipated increase in cenestin and apri revenues 
as discussed in the outlook above  solvay pharmaceuticals will share the gross profits generated from cenestin and gedeon richter will share in the profits of apri 
the increased gross margin in reflected the favorable impacts of pricing actions taken toward the end of the second quarter  contract revenues from warner lambert  and contributions from newly approved products  partially offset by increased competition for the company s methylprednisolone product 
the reduced gross margin in primarily reflected the continued decline in methylprednisolone profitability  principally due to price erosion 
the margin erosion for methylprednisolone was partially offset by sales of products sourced from other manufacturers and  in the fourth quarter  the positive contribution from the manufacturing agreement signed with warner lambert in september various factors are expected to impact the company s gross margin in and beyond  the most significant of which will be the rate at which cenestin penetrates the ert market 
additionally  the company s gross margin could be favorably impacted by successful introduction and marketing of other recently approved products  additional approvals of pending applications and contributions from the company s agreement with warner lambert 
fda approval of the company s pending applications is outside the company s control and management cannot predict whether or when these approvals will be obtained 
the company s generic products are subject to price deterioration as market conditions change  particularly when additional competitive products are introduced as a result of fda approvals as experienced with certain of the company s products  particularly methylprednisolone and the company s oral contraceptive product  apri 
these impacts can be material depending on the products affected

the decrease in product development expense in was due principally to a reduction of spending for bioequivalency studies in an effort to conserve resources 
additionally  product development expenses during were impacted by reduced spending on duramed europe operations

in  the company restructured the operation to conserve resources while still providing duramed with access to certain rights to products developed by duramed europe 
in  in view of the fda s decision regarding the company s generic conjugated estrogens anda  the company determined that it was prudent to write off existing conjugated estrogens inventory 
accordingly  a charge in the amount of  was recorded in the first quarter of and reflected in product development expenses for the year 
while general accepted accounting principles do not allow for reversal of the write off  the product inventory has been maintained and utilized in the sales efforts for cenestin 
the company s product development emphasis is on hormonal therapies  modified release technologies  and controlled substances development 
product development expenses for and beyond are dependent on the timing of biostudies and clinical studies and the company s continuing efforts to balance product development spending and available resources 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing expenses for decreased  compared with  excluding brand marketing expenses of million 
the decrease principally relates to the reduction of the sales and marketing staff positions and attendant costs assigned to the baseline business 
the brand marketing expenses relate to the company s marketing program for cenestin 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  in compared with  excluding a charge in the first quarter of of  in connection with contractual commitments associated with the company s generic conjugated estrogens product 
the increase in selling expenses in was a result of increased costs associated with preparing for the launch of its synthetic conjugated estrogens product as a brand product

if equity capital is raised  the extent of dilution to current shareholders will be dependent on the amount of equity capital obtained and the terms under which it is raised
