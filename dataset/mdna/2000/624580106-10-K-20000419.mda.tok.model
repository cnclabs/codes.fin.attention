general wholesale sales 
among the more significant factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures  and product pricing decisions 
fiscal sales were also impacted by the sale of the piaget and corum businesses 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales are affected by foreign exchange rates 
significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
the company s business is very seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s domestic markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays  and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center around significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
these markets are a less significant portion of the company s business and therefore  their impact is far less than that of the selling seasons in north america 
during fiscal  the company completed the sale of both the piaget and corum distribution businesses and substantially all the assets associated with these businesses 
prior to the sale  the company had been the exclusive distributor of these brands in north america 
the company completed the sale of its piaget business to vlg in february and sold its corum business to corum switzerland in january the disposition of these brands negatively impacted sales in fiscal retail sales 
the company s retail operations consist of outlet stores located throughout the us and five full priced movado boutiques 
the company does not have any overseas retail operations 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence domestic wholesale operations 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations  and therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist season associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
luxury and premium retail price point models generally earn lower gross margins than more popular moderate price models 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower retail prices 
gross margins in the full priced movado boutiques exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns full channel margins from manufacture to point of sale in this business 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is  therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
in addition  the company s wholesale operation periodically engages in liquidation sales of discontinued models at reduced prices 
the level of these sales in a particular period can also have a significant impact on the company s gross margins 
manufacturing costs of the company s brands consist primarily of component costs  internal and subcontractor assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in the us  switzerland and the far east 
the company seeks to control and reduce component and subcontractor labor costs through a combination of negotiations with existing suppliers and alternative sourcing 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics and minor assembly in the us and switzerland and a product sourcing operation in the far east 
the company has historically controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company  therefore  hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program has  in the recent past  been reasonably successful in stabilizing product costs and therefore gross margins despite exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of sales commissions  sales force costs and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary proportionally with overall sales levels 
retail operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rents 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  the cost of part time help to meet seasonal needs  and shipping costs and supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs and various other general corporate expenses 
operating expenses over the last three fiscal years reflect the effect of the implementation of the company s growth strategy 
the more significant expenses associated with this strategy included advertising and marketing expenses designed to increase market share for all of the company s watch brands  both domestically and internationally  additions to the company s sales force  salaries and rents associated with additional outlet stores and the movado boutiques  the addition of staff to support distribution  inventory management and customer service requirements coincident with growth of the company s business  and general and administrative expenses  such as employee benefits and the development of the company s information systems infrastructure 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and net sales 
comparative net sales by product class were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands concord  movado  coach and esq domestic    international    piaget and corum   other    net sales    total net sales increased for the year ended january  sales from ongoing operations  excluding the disposed piaget and corum distribution businesses  increased to million from million in the prior year 
domestic sales of the company s core concord  movado  esq and coach brands increased 
all of the company s core brands experienced high single or low double digit percentage growth rates in the domestic market 
international sales of the company s core brands increased led by the continuing international rollout of the coach watch brand in the far east  which resulted in a near doubling of coach watch international sales in fiscal international sales of the concord brand also increased approximately 
other net sales  which includes the company s outlet stores  movado boutiques and after sales service business  increased over the prior year 
this growth was primarily attributable to double digit comparable store sales gains in both the outlets and the boutiques and new store openings in both of these retail venues  offset by a decrease in after sales service revenues as a result of the sale of the piaget business 
gross margins 
the gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the fiscal gross margin included a one time charge of million to write down non core component inventories 
the company s non core component inventory is the result of stockpiling component parts necessary to support after sales service of core product  which is subsequently discontinued due to new product model introductions 
during fiscal  the company initiated a project to convert such of its non core component inventory that is no longer necessary for after sales service into finished watches for sale through liquidation channels or the company s outlet division 
while this program was successful in converting a portion of such total non core component inventory into saleable finished watches in fiscal and the company expects to continue this program  there will inevitably be some residual non core component inventory that will not be cost effective to attempt to assemble into finished product 
fiscal gross margins also reflect a million negative adjustment to inventory following physical counts conducted at year end 
the company believes the inventory adjustment was caused by issues associated with the existing distribution environment and implementation of new information systems in the us in fiscal the company s us sales have increased significantly in recent years resulting in a corresponding increase in unit volumes processed by and warehoused in the existing us distribution facility which operates in converted office space located in lyndhurst  nj 
managing the unit volume growth was also complicated by the implementation in of new information systems requiring distribution personnel to adjust to new technology  procedures and practices in conducting product shipment and warehouse operations 
the company has transitioned to the new information system environment and will address the physical space constraints issue by relocating its distribution operations to more traditional warehouse space see operating expenses below 
the new larger space will permit the company to employ more effective and efficient product handling and storage practices 
excluding the charges described above  gross margins for fiscal were of sales compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to fourth quarter sales mix  which included a higher level of lower margin liquidation sales and outlet sales than the previous year 
this was due  in part  to underproduction of higher margin core range products and substitution of lower margin non core items to meet demand for product 
higher levels of liquidation and outlet sales also reflected the company s commitment to reduce working capital employed in the business 
the company s gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  principally as a result of sales mix  particularly an increase in the proportion of concord  movado and esq sales to net sales 
the company s gross margin also benefited by increases in the us dollar against the swiss franc 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal were million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal fiscal operating expenses include a million fourth quarter nonrecurring charge associated with the planned relocation of the company s us distribution operations 
this charge includes a write off of assets that are not transferable to the new facility as well as lease termination costs associated with exiting the company s existing facility 
excluding this charge  operating expenses were million or of sales compared to million or of sales in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses of approximately or million relates to several areas  including advertising and marketing expenses  which increased million or  selling expenses  which increased million or  distribution costs  which increased million or  and general and administrative expenses  which increased million or 
the increase in advertising costs related to increased media and cooperative advertising programs with retailers in support of the company s brands  higher advertising production costs due to the launch of new media campaigns for both the concord and esq brands  increased spending on point of sale support material such as displays and product brochures  and the development of a new advertising and marketing management team 
selling expenses increased in both the company s wholesale and retail businesses 
selling expenses in the wholesale business primarily reflect higher levels of sales commissions due to sales increases across the company s brands 
headcount increases in the coach and esq brands to support growth also resulted in increased compensation and travel expenses 
selling expenses for fiscal also reflect the first year of amortization of the company s major trade show exhibition facility constructed for use at the annual basel international watch and jewelry show 
increases in selling expenses associated with the company s retail operations relate primarily to the addition of four new outlets and one movado boutique in fiscal as well as the annualization of costs of stores opened during fiscal distribution expenses are largely variable in nature and these expenses grew proportionately with increases in unit volume shipments 
increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily in the area of human resources and information systems 
the company experienced increases in employee benefit costs associated with a growing workforce as well as recruiting fees  specifically associated with the hiring of two senior executives in the fourth quarter 
information systems related expenses increased as the company began amortizing its significant investment in its new us core system effective with the march implementation date and incurred year remediation expenses relative to systems in the switzerland and its other international subsidiaries 
the company also added information systems support personnel in fiscal interest expense 
net interest expense in fiscal was consistent with the previous year amounting to million 
gross interest expense increased by  or due primarily to the first full year of interest expense on million of series a senior notes which were issued in december these increases were offset largely by interest income from the investment of the million proceeds from the company s sale of the piaget business in february net interest expense for fiscal and was million and consisted primarily of interest on the company s senior notes  series a senior notes  revolving lines of credit and borrowings against working capital lines 
income taxes 
the company s income tax provision amounted to million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively  or of pretax income for fiscal and for fiscal and the effective rate for fiscal reflects a tax benefit as a result of a current year net operating loss in the company s us operations 
also  a portion of the company s consolidated operations are located in non us jurisdictions  and  therefore  the company s effective rate differs from us statutory rates 
the majority of the company s non us operations are located in jurisdictions with statutory rates below us rates 
the company believes that the near term future effective tax rate will increase to the to range reflecting the company s current expectation that domestic earnings will gradually increase as a percentage of the overall earnings mix 
however  there can be no assurance of this result as it is dependent on a number of factors  including the mix of foreign to domestic earnings  local statutory tax rates and the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions 
liquidity and financial position cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were million compared to a use of cash in operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal resulted from a reduction in working capital  in particular  inventories and accounts receivable 
operating cash flows in fiscal and were negative due to increases in both inventory and accounts receivable 
the company generated net positive cash flows from investing activities in fiscal of million primarily as a result of the sale of its piaget business to vlg for million in cash 
this compared to million and million cash utilized in investing activities in fiscal and  respectively  primarily for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal and related primarily to management information systems projects  the addition of four new outlet stores and one movado boutique  and construction of a major tradeshow exhibition facility used annually at the basel international watch and jewelry show 
the company s capital expenditures for fiscal and fiscal amounted to million and million  respectively 
expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to planned expenditures for the company s information systems  including retail information systems  expansion of the company s movado boutiques and further expansion of the company s network of outlet stores 
expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to improvements in the company s management and sales management information systems and costs incurred in connection with the expansion of domestic distribution operations 
the company expects that annual capital expenditures in the near term will approximate the levels experienced in fiscal and and will relate primarily to relocating its us distribution operations  various information systems projects and leasehold improvements associated with additional outlet stores 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million in fiscal this compares to million and million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and  respectively 
at january  the company had two series of senior notes outstanding 
senior notes due january  were originally issued in a private placement completed in fiscal these notes have required annual principal payments of million since january the company repaid million and million in principal amount of these notes in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at january   million in principal amount of these notes remained outstanding 
during fiscal  the company issued million of series a senior notes under a note purchase and private shelf agreement dated november  this agreement allows for the issuance for up to two years from the date of the agreement of senior promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to million with maturities up to years from their original date of issuance 
the million series a senior notes issued in fiscal bear interest at and mature on october  the notes are subject to annual repayments of million commencing october  the company finances its seasonal working capital requirements through borrowings under its bank lines of credit 
the company borrows from its bank group under both a million unsecured revolving line and million of annually renewable working capital lines of credit 
borrowings under the revolving line are governed by a three year agreement among the company and its bank group 
the agreement was originally dated july  and was last amended in march to revise certain financial covenants and substantially increase the company s ability to purchase shares under its ongoing share repurchase program 
the company is presently in discussions with its bank group regarding a renewal of the agreement and expects to complete the renewal by may due to significant increases in market interest spreads since the july  agreement was completed  the company expects that interest spreads contained in the new revolving credit agreement will be significantly higher than those contained in the current agreement 
the company is also renegotiating its annually renewable working capital lines coincident with renewal of the revolving credit facility since these lines are with three members of the company s bank group that are party to the revolving credit facility 
at january   the company had million of outstanding borrowings under its bank lines as compared to million at january  under a series of share repurchase authorizations approved by the board of directors  the company has maintained a discretionary buy back program throughout fiscal current year purchases under the repurchase program amounted to million 
as of the date of the filing of this report on form k  the company had remaining million against an aggregate authorization of million 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million of stock under a  share program that had been authorized by the board of directors in march this program had been put in place to mitigate the dilutive impact of employee compensation programs 
cash dividends in fiscal amounted to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash and cash equivalents at january  amounted to million compared to million at january  net debt to total capitalization at january  was as compared to at january  in summary  the company made significant progress in fiscal improving its liquidity by selling underperforming assets piaget and corum and significantly reducing working capital committed to the business per sales dollar generated  primarily through the success of its inventory reduction programs 
the company plans to continue to focus on improving its cash flows in fiscal recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas in june sfas requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and established new accounting practices for hedge instruments 
sfas was originally scheduled for implementation for fiscal years ending after june   however  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
which defers the effective date of sfas for one year 
for the company  sfas will be effective for the first quarter of fiscal management is currently analyzing the effect that sfas is expected to have on the company s statement of position and results of operations 
market risks the company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company purchases various financial instruments  predominately forward and option contracts 
gains and losses on financial instruments resulting from this hedging activity are offset by the effects of the currency movements on respective underlying hedged transactions 
if the company did not engage in a hedging program  any change in the swiss franc to local currency would have an equal effect on the entities cost of sales 
as of january   the company s hedging portfolio consisted of various dates ranging through january  with an average forward rate of swiss francs per dollar 
the company has million of option contracts with a maturity date of february  the option contracts have an average strike price of swiss francs per dollar 
as of january   the carrying value of the options amounted to approximately million  which represents the unamortized premium of the option and a fair market value of approximately million 
in addition  the company has certain debt obligations with variable interest rates  which are based on libor plus a fixed additional interest rate 
the company does not hedge these interest rate risks 
the company also has certain debt obligations with fixed interest rates 
the difference between the market based interest rates at january  and the fixed rates was minimal 
year the company initiated a project in the project to improve and standardize data and computer technology and consequentially all obsolete hardware and software either have been replaced with systems that are year compliant or  in the case of certain business applications software in switzerland  canada and the far east  have been made year compliant pending replacement 
as part of the project  new client server core business applications software supporting manufacturing  distribution  sales  accounting and after sales service was implemented in the us in march the company expects to complete the implementation of this software in switzerland during fiscal and in canada and the far east thereafter 
the company monitored the year system status of customers and vendors involved with electronic data interchange edi with our systems by the use of questionnaires 
as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k  all of the company s mission critical systems have been successfully tested for year compliance  and the company has not experienced any significant year problems with any of those systems or with the systems of any suppliers or customers with whom the company is involved in edi 
although the company has not experienced any significant year problems to date  it plans to continue to monitor the situation closely 
while we cannot be sure that we have been completely successful in our efforts to address the year issue or that problems could not still arise that would cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition  we believe that our most reasonably likely worst case scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather that with our internal systems 
we are limited in our efforts to address the year issue as it relates to third parties  however  and rely solely on the assurances of these third parties as to their year preparedness 
costs associated with systems replacement and modification to become year compliant under the contingency plan outside of the project were million 
the estimated cost of the project is approximately million 
the total amount expended on the project through january  was approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the company will not incur significant year related costs due to the failure of customers  vendors and other third parties to be year compliant
