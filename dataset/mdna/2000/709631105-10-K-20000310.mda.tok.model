this diversification enables the company to consistently improve results despite difficult markets in one or another segment 
continuing demand for power tools and service equipment  ever rising needs for clean water throughout the world  and the critical importance of protecting sensitive electronics give pentair s chosen businesses excellent prospects for strong long term performance 
the company s basic operating strategies ongoing cost containment  new product development  multi channel distribution  and the pursuit of value added acquisitions drive the businesses in both growing and softer economies 
pentair is focusing on implementation of its corporate wide process redesign and cost savings programs initiated in which management believes will continue to improve operating efficiencies and therefore performance 
pentair began implementation in of a program to consolidate a number of its businesses into larger  more effective units which will be better positioned to compete in their respective markets 
pentair s tool businesses  porter cable and delta  will consolidate their operations in the first quarter of  following an earlier combination of their sales organizations 
also underway in and to be completed in is the consolidation of two service equipment businesses century and lincoln automotive  including the closing of one manufacturing facility 
the tool businesses also have completed construction of a new  square foot warehouse facility in jackson  tennessee 
the warehouse is expected to go into full operation in the first quarter of  when two smaller warehouses for delta and porter cable will close 
the acquisition of essef in august has increased the complexity and opportunities in the wft businesses 
pentair has closed one of the acquired facilities and relocated manufacturing operations  over the next few quarters  pentair intends to continue reorganization and consolidation of units in order to improve manufacturing efficiencies and financial performance 
in addition  the company s eee segment combined five separate north american facilities into one business  pentair electronic packaging  in order to focus on the high growth custom and modified enclosure market for datacom and telecom products 
the company continues to look for synergistic acquisitions in each of its business segments  in line with its pattern over the past five years 
of the fifteen acquisitions made since  most were smaller businesses or product lines  which fit with existing operations  offering new products or expanded geographic scope 
three recent transactions in and  however  were stand alone acquisitions of large established businesses  two in pentair s wft segment general signal pump group and essef and one in its pte segment devilbiss air power company 
pentair intends to continue to pursue smaller  bolt on purchases  but will also carefully review larger targets that have the capability to significantly expand its current segments  or in appropriate cases  that establish an additional business segment 
segment discussion pentair operates in three segments professional tools and equipment pte  water and fluid technologies wft  and electrical and electronic enclosures eee 
professional tools and equipment the pte segment includes the tool businesses delta and porter cable  and the equipment businesses century and the newly acquired devilbiss air power company 
products manufactured include woodworking machinery  portable power tools  battery charging and testing equipment  welding equipment  lubricating and lifting equipment  air compressors  generators and pressure washers 
versus net sales increased substantially in  from million to  million  or 
net sales in the fourth quarter increased 
the devilbiss air power company acquisition accounted for a significant portion of the sales increase 
the increase in internal growth in is attributable in large part to continued innovation and new product introductions by each of the businesses in this segment 
pte operating income for the year increased to million  after the restructuring charge  or 
excluding the restructuring charge  operating income was million  or an increase of 
for the fourth quarter  operating income for the segment was million or better than  attributable to the devilbiss air power company acquisition 
both full year and fourth quarter operating income for the segment was unfavorably impacted by two factors one time costs not covered by the restructuring charge incurred as a result of the consolidation of operations as well as severe competitive pressures for certain automotive and service products 
segment return on sales before restructuring charge was down basis points to for the full year  although operating margins for the segment excluding acquisitions was comparable to the recorded for segment return on sales after the restructuring charge was 
for the fourth quarter  return on sales for the entire segment was compared to in the same period in  attributable in part to the new acquisition 
versus pte sales increased by million or 
these businesses continue to outperform their markets  upholding a performance record that includes three consecutive years of double digit sales growth and five consecutive years of double digit operating income growth 
the tool businesses continued to introduce innovative new products such as a plate joiner and jigsaw and expanded its offering of pneumatic nailers  staplers and accessories 
the service equipment business increased sales of booster pacs and expanded its automotive offering with the product line acquisition of t tech automatic transmission fluid exchangers 
operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in profitability increased in the tool business due to favorable sourcing opportunities and volume efficiencies 
profitability also increased in the service equipment business due to productivity improvements and facility rationalizations 
outlook the professional tools and equipment segment is expected to continue to realize sales growth in  both as a result of the devilbiss air power company acquisition and  more importantly  continued organic growth as a result of continued new product introductions and increased cross selling of products  including acquired products  across all major distribution channels 
operations will be adversely impacted for the first half of as a result of continuing one time costs for consolidations of segment business units and start up costs at the new jackson  tennessee distribution center 
nonetheless  pentair expects continued improvement in operating margins and income throughout the coming year  as a result of the acquisition and of other manufacturing  purchasing and distribution efficiencies 
water and fluid technologies the wft segment includes the pump and pool businesses pentair pump group and one of the newly acquired essef businesses  the water treatment businesses pentair water treatment which consists of fleck controls plus the remaining essef business and lincoln industrial 
products manufactured include pumps for wells and water treatment  sump pumps  pool and spa equipment such as valves  pumps  filters  lights and related equipment  valves and pressure vessels for water treatment products and automated and manual lubrication systems 
versus net sales increased substantially in  from million to million  or 
the essef acquisition accounted for the majority of the increase for the year 
net sales in the fourth quarter increased  with organic growth accelerating to over of prior period sales 
wft operating income for the year increased to million  after the restructuring charge  or 
excluding the restructuring charge  operating income was million  or an increase of and excluding acquisitions  operating income increased nearly 
for the fourth quarter  operating income for the segment was million or better than  while excluding acquisitions  operating income was up over from the prior year 
both full year and fourth quarter operating income for the segment increased as a result of supply management initiatives and strong labor productivity 
segment return on sales before restructuring charge improved basis points to for the full year  although operating margins for the segment excluding acquisitions increased over basis points over segment return on sales after the restructuring charge was 
for the fourth quarter  return on sales for the entire segment was  down from the year earlier quarter which was 
this decrease is entirely attributable to the essef acquisition  excluding acquisitions this segment s return on sales for the period increased nearly basis points 
versus wft sales increased by million or  primarily due to the full year effect of the pump business acquisitions  internal growth accounted for approximately of the sales increase 
net revenues were adversely impacted in part by the deliberate elimination in of the unprofitable sales from the layne bowler product line  acquired as part of the general signal pump acquisition in operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in the group s performance benefited from improved performance at the water conditioning control valve business  increased profitability at european operations  and over million worth of manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies resulting from the integration of the acquired pump businesses 
outlook as a result of the essef acquisition  the wft segment greatly expanded its product and geographic capabilities 
the segment plans to focus more resources on its growth in overseas markets  especially by pentair water treatment  while continuing to implement its operating improvement initiatives previously adopted and while integrating the newly acquired businesses into its ongoing operations 
as a result of the increasing importance of the water markets to the segment following the essef acquisition  pentair announced that it is investigating strategic alternatives for its lincoln industrial business 
electrical and electronic enclosures the eee segment includes hoffman enclosures  schroff  pentair electronic packaging a newly integrated north american enclosures business  comprised of schroff us  the newly acquired web and the us affiliates of the former walker dickson business and pentair enclosures uk products manufactured include metallic and composite cases  subracks and cabinets that house and protect electrical and electronic controls  instruments and components 
versus net sales increased in  to million  most of which is attributable to the acquisition of walker dickson and the acquisition of web 
overall net sales in the fourth quarter increased  with internal growth up nearly from prior period sales 
the improvement in internal growth in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to expanded distribution in north america of standard electrical enclosure products and increased penetration into the faster growing datacom and telecom product markets  as well as accelerating growth of standard electronic enclosures in europe 
fourth quarter sales in local currency in europe improved quarter over quarter  although in us dollar terms the growth amounted to 
eee operating income for the year after the restructuring charge increased slightly to million 
excluding the restructuring charge  however  operating income improved and operating income  excluding acquisitions  increased over 
for the fourth quarter  operating income for the segment was million or better than  while excluding acquisitions  operating income was up nearly from the prior year 
segment return on sales before restructuring charge improved significantly for the full year  from to  although operating margins for the segment excluding acquisitions increased nearly basis points over segment return on sales after the restructuring charge was 
for the fourth quarter  return on sales for the entire segment was  up dramatically from the very weak year earlier quarter which was only 
excluding acquisitions  however  the increase was even stronger  which is largely attributable to vastly improved performance at the european enclosure businesses and to strong performance of all of the north american businesses 
versus eee sales decreased million or 
enclosures americas sales were lower in largely due to lower automotive and machine tool capital spending 
enclosures europe sales also decreased due to slow sales of standard product throughout europe  while enclosures asia sales were below due to the weak asian economy 
with the october acquisition of pentair enclosures uk  pentair strengthened its position in markets serving high growth manufacturers in information and communication technology markets 
operating income as a percent of sales was flat at  the same overall profitability as  despite a decrease in sales 
enclosures americas increased profits due to overhead reductions and repositioning of the sales force to focus on high growth customers and leverage modification capabilities 
enclosures europe earnings declined in part due to lower volumes and unfavorable product mix throughout europe 
in addition  the closing of one facility in france and resultant headcount reductions were delayed by a lengthy government approval process until the fourth quarter of enclosures asia profitability decreased due to the weak asian economy 
outlook pentair plans to continue process improvement and reorganization at all of the businesses in the eee segment 
while no further significant headcount reductions are currently planned  the expansion of the enclosure businesses around the world will be critical to the segment s future success in the rapidly expanding datacom and telecom fields  especially in creating a world wide capability to serve these markets  whether in the americas  europe or asia 
special restructuring charge in the first quarter of  the company recorded a special restructuring charge of million million after tax or

the anticipated benefits noted above are net of the costs of adding employees at other pentair locations 
the benefits do not  however  take into account one time costs associated with these restructuring plans 
the company anticipates that the associated one time costs will amount to approximately million  one quarter of which was incurred in  with most of the balance to be incurred in the first quarter of these costs are not included in the restructuring charge  since they relate to asset relocations  start up costs and training and recruiting of employees at other locations
