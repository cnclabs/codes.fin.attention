item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the metals service center industry was faced with a difficult market from a pricing standpoint during most of however  the company experienced record sales and earnings results  primarily due to the inclusion of sales and earnings from the four companies acquired by reliance in and the seven companies acquired by reliance in  as well as generally strong demand  product diversity and effective sales management 
although pricing for most of the company s products remained near all time lows during most of  the company was able to increase its gross margins during this period by lowering its selling prices at a slower rate than the reductions in metal costs 
in the second half of the year  as increases in certain metal costs were announced  the company began increasing selling prices for these products before the increases in the costs of these materials were effective 
again  this allowed the company to increase gross margin percentages 
the expanded product and geographic diversity obtained through recent acquisitions also contributed to the record results 
in  the company was impacted by reduced sales to the aerospace industry due mainly to decreased purchasing patterns by certain of its large aerospace customers 
during  aerospace sales were a large contributor to the company s revenues and earnings 
improvements in the semiconductor and electronics industries  along with continued strong demand in construction and related industries  allowed the company to replace the loss in aerospace related business with increased sales to these industries 
the company believes its results have been less volatile to the economic trends affecting the industry because its operations are geographically diversified  it has a wide range of products  and its customer base and the industries to which it sells are highly diversified 
reliance s diversification and financial performance have benefited from several significant acquisitions during the reported periods  each of which has been immediately accretive to earnings 
additionally  the company s successful efforts to continue to expand through strategic acquisitions and to increase its efficiencies and physical capacities through capital expenditure programs have enabled it to lessen the impact of regional economic recessions on the overall results of its operations 
management believes that the company is positioned to take full advantage of improved economic environments  while at the same time it is poised to operate efficiently in less favorable economies because of its tight cost controls  high inventory turnover and diversification 
management does not anticipate the same rate of growth in gross margins and net income in as in recent years  due to increasing costs of materials for most of its products  net of the impact of any acquisitions which may be made during recent developments the company completed four acquisitions during  and has already completed one acquisition in through these acquisitions  the company made its entry into the midwest market of the united states 
in addition  two new facilities were opened  two existing facilities were closed  and two foreign companies were formed

liebovich s annual sales were approximately million 
in february  the company s subsidiary  valex corp 
valex  purchased certain assets of one of its leading domestic competitors  advanced microfinish  inc although the purchase price amount was not material  this purchase increased valex s product diversification and provided additional technology to service the semiconductor industry 
in june  phoenix corporation phoenix metals  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  expanded its market presence by opening a new service center location in brentwood nashville  tennessee 
during december  the company opened a new tube service co 
facility in portland  oregon 
the tube service products were previously being sold through a reliance metalcenter division in portland 
opening these facilities allowed the company to expand its product diversification in existing geographic markets 
the company closed two facilities in  a reliance metalcenter division in casper  wyoming  and a chatham steel corporation chatham processing facility in birmingham  alabama  as they were not performing at levels acceptable to the company 
the company expanded its foreign presence in through valex  by establishing a corporation in france  valex sarl  and by forming a joint venture in korea  valex korea co  ltd

results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales    gross profit    operating expenses    depreciation expense    income from operations    year ended december  compared to year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands other than share and per share amounts consolidated net sales increased  or  for the year compared to  which reflects an increase in tons sold of and a decrease in the average selling price per ton of 
the increase in sales volume during was primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of sales from the acquisitions along with sales from the acquisitions  as follows phoenix metals  acquired january   durrett sheppard steel co  inc durrett  acquired january   chatham  acquired july   lusk metals  acquired september   american metals corporation american metals  acquired october   steel bar corporation steel bar  acquired october   engbar pipe steel co 
engbar  acquired october   liebovich  acquired march   allegheny  acquired september   and arrow metals  acquired october  collectively  the acquisitions 
the increased sales volume was somewhat offset due to a decrease of approximately in tons sold to the aerospace market during the average selling price for decreased from the average selling price due to lower costs of material for most of the company s products  and a shift in product mix 
as most of the companies acquired during and sell primarily carbon steel products  which generally have a lower selling price than other products sold by the company  the shift in product mix has contributed to lower average selling prices 
reduced aerospace sales volume also contributed to the lower average selling price  as the heat treated aluminum products sold to the aerospace industry are among the most high priced products sold by the company 
further  prices of heat treated aluminum products decreased during  which also lowered the average selling price 
excluding sales of the acquisitions  sales declined  primarily due to lower selling prices and changes in product mix 
the lower sales amount includes a increase in tons sold  which is primarily due to general economic improvements  especially in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the average selling price decreased by in as compared to  primarily due to reduced selling prices of most of the company s products  a greater shift toward carbon steel products  and reduced sales to the aerospace market in the company recorded a one time net gain of  from a life insurance policy  which was not taxable to the company  in connection with the company s supplemental executive retirement plan serp during the life insurance proceeds related to the death of one of the company s executive officers in january and are net of the amount to be paid to his beneficiary under the terms of the serp

this allowed the company to expand its gross margin percentage during this period of changing prices 
in addition  certain of the acquisitions typically operate at higher gross margin percentages than the company has historically operated at on a consolidated basis 
this positively contributed to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the period 
warehouse  delivery  selling  and general and administrative expenses increased  or  for due to the increased sales volume primarily from the acquisitions 
these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the lower selling prices experienced during  and due to certain of the acquisitions typically operating at higher expense levels than those historically experienced by the company on a consolidated basis 
these acquired companies also operate at higher gross margin levels  as discussed above 
excluding the acquisitions  these expenses decreased by  in compared to  on an increased sales volume of which illustrates the impact of lower selling prices on these expenses expressed as a percentage of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  for compared to the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of both the depreciation expense and the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisitions

ssa  and georgia steel supply company georgia steel  which were acquired during  along with sales from companies acquired in  which include phoenix metals  durrett  chatham  lusk metals  american metals  steel bar and engbar  collectively  the acquisitions 
the average selling price for decreased from the average selling price due to lower selling prices based on lower costs of material for most of the company s products  a shift in product mix and continued lower selling prices for electropolished stainless steel tubing and fittings sold to the semiconductor manufacturing industry in  as compared to as most of the companies acquired during sell primarily carbon steel products  which generally have a lower selling price than other products sold by the company  the shift in product mix has contributed to lower selling prices 
also  because the selling prices of electropolished stainless steel tubing and fittings sold to the semiconductor manufacturing industry are significantly higher than most other products sold by the company  the reduced quantities of this product sold during resulted in a significant decline in the overall average selling price

in addition  the company s ability to turn its inventory faster than most of its competitors allowed the company to maximize its gross margins during this period of declining prices 
warehouse  delivery  selling  and general and administrative expenses increased  or  for compared to these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the dollar increase in expenses reflects the increase in sales volume for the period  which includes the sales and related operating expenses of the acquisitions 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to selling prices declining throughout  while volume was increasing  and fixed costs remained constant 
depreciation and amortization expense increased for compared to the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of depreciation expense and the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisitions 
income from operations increased from  in to  in the increase was mainly attributable to increased gross profit and the inclusion in of operating income from the acquisitions 
interest expense increased  in compared to due to an increase in the average debt outstanding to fund the acquisitions 
the effective income tax rate of the company decreased from in to in  mainly due to the election of a tax treatment that allows the amortization of goodwill for certain of the acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands other than share and per share amounts at december   working capital amounted to  compared to  at december  cash flow from operations increased significantly for as compared to mainly due to the company s continued focus on inventory turnover  resulting in inventory levels decreasing by  excluding the addition of inventories from companies acquired in  from december  also contributing to this increase were increased net income  improved accounts receivable collectibility  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which resulted primarily from the timing of year end purchases 
the company s capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and material handling and processing equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and the company s revolving line of credit 
the syndicated credit facility has a borrowing limit of  with an allowance to use up to  of the line of credit to make acquisitions 
as of december    was outstanding under this credit facility 
the company also has an agreement that allows the company to issue and have outstanding letters of credit in an amount not to exceed  additionally  the company has agreements with insurance companies for private placements of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of  the senior notes that were issued in the private placements have maturity dates ranging from to  with an average life of years  and bear interest at an average fixed rate of per annum 
such sources of liquidity  as discussed above  were sufficient to fund the acquisitions 
the purchase price of the acquisitions made in totaled approximately  see recent developments section for a complete discussion of the acquisitions made in net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were  for the year 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company anticipates that the funds generated from operations and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
the purchase of hagerty was funded with borrowings on the company s line of credit 
the board of directors declared a for common stock split  in the form of a stock dividend  effective september   to shareholders of record september  on august   the board of directors of the company approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of the company s outstanding common stock through its stock repurchase plan  for a total of  shares 
the company has purchased a total of  shares of its common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in february  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of per share  which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
the company did not repurchase any shares during the company believes such purchases enhance shareholder value and reflect its confidence in the long term growth potential of the company 
inflation the company s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  the company has been successful in adjusting prices to its customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality the company recognizes that some of its customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of the company s geographic  product and customer diversity  however  the company s operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of the company s products and holiday closures for some of its customers 
there can be no assurance that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to  at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the amortization of goodwill amounted to  or approximately of pretax income 
the company s estimate of the useful life of goodwill of years is considered appropriate due to the long term nature of the business  including its customers  supply sources and longevity of operations 
the risk associated with the carrying value of goodwill is whether future operating income before amortization of goodwill will be sufficient on an undiscounted basis to recover the carrying value 
the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
the measurement of possible impairment is either based upon significant losses of an entity or on the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if an impairment exists  the amount of such impairment is calculated based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
in management s opinion  the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and no impairment exists at december  however  any significant change in the useful lives of goodwill  as estimated by management  could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in  the company completed its conversions  testing and modifications of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
