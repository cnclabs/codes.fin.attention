item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in the development of intuitive interface devices for a variety of home and business applications 
we were incorporated in california in february and reincorporated in delaware in july from to  we developed and refined our force sensing resistor  or fsr  technology and sold it to customers for electronic  musical  medical and other applications  which we now refer to as the specialty components market 
in  we introduced our first branded computer pointing device  portapoint  and in  we introduced our first wireless pointing device  remotepoint 
with the advent of this latter device  we established ourselves as a leading supplier to oems in the computerized presentation system market  which we now call the business communication market 
in  we introduced products for e transactions applications and began developing products for the home entertainment market 
revenue  net of allowances for returns and warranty  is recognized upon shipment of product 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
revenues have increased steadily during the last five years as we have established ourselves in new markets and built a base of oem customers in the computer and computer peripheral industry 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined between and as a result of the increasing percentage of our business that involved sales of computer products to oems but has remained relatively steady over the last three years 
product development and research expenditures  which includes engineering  contract engineering and development and material costs of development  have generally increased as revenue has increased but has remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in existing markets and to develop new ones 
selling  general and administrative expense  which includes sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising  sales commissions  reseller incentives  tradeshow costs and other sales expenses  has declined each year as a percentage of sales  reflecting the amortization of a relatively fixed expense requirement over a larger revenue base 
because of net operating loss carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we historically have not paid income tax 
beginning in  some of these loss carryforwards began to expire or become fully utilized  therefore income taxes are expected to increase on both a percentage and absolute dollar basis 
other income expense was significant in as the result of a non recurring legal settlement expense 
prior to  operations was a net user of cash and we funded this through existing cash balances  private placements of equity and to a lesser extent  bank and lease financing 
in  operations was a net provider of cash  generating million 
sales of business communication intuitive interface devices accounted for of our total sales in and of our total sales in the three years ended december  our business communication sales in dollars grew at an average annualized rate of in because our market share for business communication interface devices is approximately  we expect that our ability to achieve further revenue growth in this market will largely depend on growth in the market itself 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communication market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately of our revenues came from japanese customers 
as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we have licensed certain technology related to the production of fsr sensors to international electronics and engineering  a former affiliate based in luxembourg  for use in connection with sales of sensors to the automotive industry 
we are entitled to royalties in connection with sales of automotive sensors outside europe 
royalties earned in approximated  we have occasionally licensed other aspects of our technology in connection with the settlement of intellectual property disputes and expect to continue to do so in the future 
beginning in the second quarter of this year  we plan to spend between and million to market our technology to digital set top box manufacturers  cable and other service providers and others in the home entertainment market and increase customer awareness and product development efforts in the e transactions market 
as a result  we expect product development expense to increase more quickly than revenue 
we also expect marketing and sales expense to increase at a rate that exceeds its historical rate of increase as a result of these expenditures 
in june and june  the aicpa issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
and required its adoption beginning january  the company will adopt this standard in january and is currently analyzing the statement to determine the impact  if any  on the company s financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues gross profit operating expenses product development and research selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense income tax net income fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenues increased from million in to million in this revenue growth is a result primarily of growth in sales to the business communication market and  to a lesser extent  from a threefold increase in home entertainment sales to million reflecting our initial penetration of that market 
gross profit as a percent of sales did not change appreciably 
product development and research expense increased from million in to million in while increasing marginally as a percentage of sales 
the increase reflects our continuing commitment to develop products that will support our leadership position in our existing and targeted markets 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in and but declined as a percentage of sales from in to in the percentage decrease represents the amortization of a relatively stable general and administrative burden over increased sales 
income taxes were significant for the first time in at  as our japanese subsidiary fully utilized its tax loss carryforwards and began to accrue tax on income 
we expect income taxes to increase absolutely and as a percentage of pretax income as the federal and state income tax loss carryforwards become fully utilized or expire as well 
other expense was insignificant in and declined from as a result of a one time charge related to a legal settlement expense of  in operating income was million and net income was million in  the increases over were primarily attributable to increased sales 
fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenues increased from million in to million in this revenue growth resulted from our focus on developing and marketing our computer pointing device product line primarily in the business communication market 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from in to in this decline was a result of the growth of our sales to oem customers  which typically carry a lower gross profit percentage as compared to non oem sales 
additionally  in  the business communication industry experienced the rapid product development and price competition typically experienced in the computer hardware industry 
product development and research expense decreased from million in to million in during  development costs were materially affected by the development costs  both internal and external  relating to the introduction of our versapad registered trademark technology and the development of remotelink technology 
in resources were added to support the increased oem business both in the us and japan and to develop the new product freedomwriter first shipped in december and a new touchpad peripheral introduced in july selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased from in to in this decline resulted from the amortization of relatively fixed costs over a greater base of sales and the shift in product mix towards oem sales 
we recorded a profit from operations of  in and  in results were affected by a one time write off due to yield problems related to the new versapad technology that more than offset continued strong revenue growth and cost containment efforts 
the improvement in was a result of continued growth from the oem business which allowed for strong cost containment that offset the lower gross profit percentage 
other expense  relatively minor in prior years  reached  in due to a one time legal settlement expense of  the revenue growth in our computer pointing device product line  and operating cost control contributed to achieve net income of  in and  in the results in were affected by a one time write off due to yield problems related to the new versapad technology that more than offset continued strong revenue growth and cost containment efforts 
the results in were negatively impacted by a one time charge related to a legal settlement of  quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of revenue 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to fairly present the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million versus million at the end of this increase resulted from positive results from operations  from the proceeds from debt agreements obtained through japanese banks and equity issuances related to employee stock options 
operations changed from a net user of cash of  in to a net provider of cash of million in this improvement resulted from the positive results from operations coupled with improved accounts receivable and inventory management and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we spent  in and  in to purchase additional manufacturing equipment and computer equipment related to our internal computer network 
in  we invested  in new patents 
in  we negotiated an increase in the maximum available under our japanese bank line of credit to million  none of which was used as of december  our us line of credit was unused at december  and had million of availability as of that date 
we also believe there are a number of sources available for the leasing of equipment 
the exercise of outstanding stock options is a potential source of equity capital that may be available to us 
we believe that our current cash balances  lines of credit and net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  an unforeseen downturn of results in sufficient magnitude could effect our ability to meet that forecast 
foreign currency exchange risk the japanese subsidiary generally makes its sales and collects its accounts receivable in japanese yen 
to hedge these revenues against future movements in exchange rates  we will from time to time purchase foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are then offset by gains or losses on the underlying exposure and consequently a sudden or significant change of foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on net income or cash flows to the extent future revenues are protected by forward currency contracts 
during  the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the normal course of business to manage its exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
the principle objective of such contracts was to minimize the risks and costs associated with financial and global operating activities 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
there were no off balance sheet derivatives during or the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million 
during fiscal  the company recognized  of losses on foreign currency exchange contracts which is reflected in revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
year compliance we have assessed the year compliance of each of the products we manufacture and sell 
we believe each of those products and their component parts is year compliant 
we have assessed the sensitivity of our internal manufacturing control  accounting and information management systems and determined that a majority of our systems have no material year deficiencies 
as of march   we have not experienced any problem indicating that our information technology systems are not year compliant 
we cannot assure you that we have successfully identified all of our internal year issues 
the failure to identify and address internal year issues in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we requested each of our suppliers of critical parts and services to provide information to us about the entity s anticipated year compliance 
to date  we have not received notice of or become aware of any material year deficiency by a significant vendor  financial institution or customer 
as of march   we have not experienced any problems or received any notification that any major supplier  subcontractor or customer is not year compliant 
we have not incurred significant expenditures for software  hardware  and system related costs in connection with remediation of year issues
