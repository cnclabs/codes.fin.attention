value at risk under securities and exchange commission rules  the company is required to disclose information about its exposure to market risk 
as permitted by sec rules  the company used a statistical technique known as value at risk var to estimate the potential daily earnings effect of adverse changes in fair value of its trading positions 
var incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of the company s trading portfolio  including equity and interest rates  associated volatilities  as well as the correlation that exists among these variables 
the company calculated var using a variance covariance model with confidence level of over a one day holding period 
that is  the company s var represents a potential one day loss in value that would be exceeded less than of the time if the portfolio were unchanged 
among the benefits  a var model permits the estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporates a range of varied market risks in the calculation  reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification  and is comprehensive yet relatively easy to interpret 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the fact that past changes in market risk will not always accurately predict future changes in a portfolio s value  the model does not include all of a trading portfolio s market risk factors  and any published var results which reflect a point in time analysis ie  december  positions do not fully capture the market risk of positions that may not be liquidated or hedged within one day 
the company is aware of these and other limitations and therefore views var as only one component in its risk management review process 
the table below presents the company s var results for each of the company s primary risk exposures as well as on an aggregate basis and incorporates substantially all financial instruments generating market risk 
since var is based on historical data and changes in market risk factor returns  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance or its ability to manage and monitor risk 
also  there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below 
the company s var results are as follows in thousands december  primary market risk interest rate var  equity var sub total   less diversification benefit total  the diversification benefit represents the elimination of market risks which are present and are offsetting in both the interest rate var and the equity var 
during  the company s var varied from a high of million to a low of million primarily due to an increase in financial instruments generating market risk as a result of current year acquisitions 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
during  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company did not experience any significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year change 
through december   the company s costs related to year were minimal and were funded out of working capital 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any unidentified year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
