net revenues 
net revenues are presented below in five categories windows application servers  computing appliances products  management services products  microsoft royalties and other revenue 
windows application servers revenue represents fees related to the licensing of the company s metaframe and winframe products  subscriptions and additional user licenses 
computing appliances products revenue consists of license fees and royalties from oems who are granted a license to incorporate and or market the company s multi user technologies in their own product offerings 
management services products consist of system option products such as load balancing services  resource management services and other options  which are applicable to both the metaframe and winframe product lines 
microsoft royalties represent fees recognized in connection with the development agreement 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to increases in the volume of shipments of the company s metaframe product line and associated additional user licenses  which began shipping in june  while sales of the winframe product line and associated additional user licenses decreased 
the company expects that revenue from metaframe based products will constitute an increasing percentage of net revenue and that revenue from winframe based products will decrease as a percentage of net revenues 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues in was due to an increase in revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft and increases in the volume of shipments of management services products  primarily due to higher sales levels of the load balancing services product as end users continue to implement larger scale metaframe solutions 
the company anticipates the revenue from the development agreement with microsoft will account for a decreasing percentage of net revenues 
net revenues of computing appliances products declined in due to decreased volume of licensing to oems 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of the company s metaframe product and additional user licenses  which were first shipped in june  and increases in unit sales of management services products 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues in was attributable to an increase in unit sales of winframe and an increase in revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft 
an analysis of the company s net revenues is detailed in the table below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to windows application servers computing appliances products management services products microsoft royalties other revenue net revenues international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this annual report 
the increase in international revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the company s increased sales and marketing efforts in europe and asia 
the company anticipates that international revenues will account for an increasing percentage of net revenues in the future 
an analysis of geographic segment net revenue is detailed in the table below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to americas emea asia pacific other consolidated net revenues the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to continued demand for citrix products in the americas and europe  middle east africa emea regions and larger scale metaframe implementations in these regions 
the emea revenue increase is also due to greater sales and marketing efforts in europe and the opening and expansion of additional sales offices in that region 
the decrease in other revenue  which primarily consists of revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft and revenue from oems  decreased due to a lower volume of licensing to oems 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in the americas and emea regions due to the release of the company s metaframe product  which was first shipped in june emea revenue also increased due to a greater sales and marketing presence in europe via the addition and expansion of offices in various european countries 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues in was attributable to an increase in other revenue due to an increase related to the development agreement with microsoft 
the company will continue investing in international markets and expanding its international operations by establishing additional foreign operations  hiring personnel  expanding its international sales force and adding third party channel partners 
international revenues may fluctuate in future periods as a result of difficulties in staffing  dependence on an independent distribution channel  competition  variability of foreign economic and political conditions and changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  localized product release timing and marketing such products in foreign countries 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
cost of oem revenues included in cost of revenues primarily consisted of cost of royalties  except where the oem elected to purchase shrink wrapped products  in which case such costs were as described in the previous sentence 
all development costs incurred in connection with the development agreement are expensed as incurred as a separate component of cost of revenues 
the company s cost of revenues exclude the amortization of core technology 
gross margin 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of net revenues from to was primarily due to increases in sales of the metaframe product and related user licenses 
the metaframe product line has a relatively high gross margin contribution as the metaframe product line bears no royalties 
additionally  the increase in gross margin contribution is partly due to an adjustment to royalties payable associated with higher than expected additional user licenses deployed with metaframe products 
gross margin related to the development agreement increased from to due primarily to an increase in revenue related to the development agreement as well as a decrease in related engineering and support expenses which decreased due to the maturity level of the metaframe product 
the overall increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues for was partially offset by an increase in inventory reserves 
the company anticipates gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will decrease as the company increases its consulting services offering which has a lower gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of net revenues from to was primarily attributable to the introduction of the metaframe product line which has a relatively high gross margin contribution  as it bears no royalty  compared to the winframe product line 
in the third quarter of  the company began shipping winframe version  which had a higher gross margin than the previous winframe version  due to lower royalty fees and fewer components 
the overall increase in gross margin was partially offset by gross margin contribution related to the development agreement revenue  which has a lower gross margin as a percentage of net revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
to date  all internal software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
increases in research and development expenses in and resulted primarily from additional staffing  associated salaries and related expenses required to expand and enhance the company s product lines 
additionally  in  research and development expenses increased as a result of third party expenses associated with the translation and localization of the metaframe and winframe products 
these costs were partially offset by the allocation of certain research and development expenses to cost of revenues for the portion of these expenses associated with the development agreement revenues 
all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred except for certain intangible assets related to the acquisitions and licensing described herein 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses in resulted  in part  from increased sales staff and associated salaries  commissions and expenses related to expansion of the company s sales force 
the increase was also due to higher levels of promotional activities and marketing programs directed at customer and business partner acquisition and retention  increased marketing staff and associated salaries  and additional advertising activities related to specific product lines and corporate branding 
promotional activities include various demand generation programs and other promotional activities such as direct mail campaigns  programs directed at resellers and trade shows 
increases in sales  marketing and support expenses in resulted primarily from increases in promotional and advertising activities to expand product specific marketing programs  such as the metaframe launch in the increase was also due to increased sales and marketing staff and associated salaries  commissions and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
increases in general and administrative expenses in and resulted primarily from increased staff  associated salaries and related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the company s operations and in  for additional expenditures related to improvements to its information systems 
amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in and is primarily due to the acquisition of insignia solutions  plc in february  apm ltd 
in june  vdonet corporation ltd 
in july  and the epicon licensing arrangement in january these acquisitions resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  at their respective date of acquisition or licensing 
additionally  for  the increase was due to the acquisition of viewsoft  inc in july which resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of approximately million 
as of december   the company had net goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  associated with these transactions  remaining to be amortized over four years following the acquisitions 
the company anticipates that amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets will increase due to the continuation of the company s acquisition efforts 
in process research and development 
in  the company completed the acquisition of certain in process software technologies from viewsoft  in which it allocated million of the purchase price to ipr d 
during  the company completed acquisitions and a licensing of certain in process software technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to ipr d 
the company allocated million  million and million for ipr d related to the insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions  respectively  and million for ipr d related to the licensing agreement with epicon 
since the respective dates of acquisition and licensing  the company has used the acquired in process technology to develop new product offerings and enhancements  which have or will become part of the company s suite of products when completed 
functionality included in products using the acquired in process technology have been introduced at various times following the respective transaction dates of the acquired assets and licensing  and the company currently expects to complete the development of the remaining projects at various dates in upon completion  the company has offered and intends to offer the related products to its customers 
the nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products or features and functionalities within the citrix suite of existing products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the company currently expects that products utilizing the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the software industry  particularly the server based computing environment  changes in technology  changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause the company to alter or abandon product plans 
failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in process research and development will not deviate from the projections used to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions 
ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed technology  and the company as a whole  are subject to a variety of factors which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transactions  and the estimates discussed below should not be considered the company s current projections for operating results for the acquired assets or licensed technology or the company as a whole 
the fair value of the in process technology in each acquisition was based on analyses of the markets  projected cash flows and risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows 
in developing these cash flow projections  revenues were estimated based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual service offering revenues  characteristics of the potential market for the service offerings and the anticipated life of the underlying technology 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were estimated based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process research and development  and included assumptions that certain expenses would decline over time  although there are no acquirer specific synergies identified in the assumption model 
the company assumed material net cash inflows would commence in for the epicon licensing agreement and insignia acquisition and in for the apm  vdonet and viewsoft acquisitions 
appropriate adjustments were made to operating income to derive net cash flow  and the estimated net cash flows of the in process technologies in each acquisition were then discounted to present value using rates of return that the company believes reflect the specific risk return characteristics of these research and development projects 
the selection of discount rates for application in each acquisition were based on the consideration of i the weighted average cost of capital  which measures a company s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in its target capital structure  ii the corresponding weighted average return on assets which measures the after tax return required on the assets employed in the business weighted by each asset group s percentage of the total asset portfolio  and iii venture capital required rates of return which typically relate to equity financing for relatively high risk business projects 
the risk adjusted discount rates were    and for the epicon licensing agreement  insignia  apm  vdonet and viewsoft acquisitions  respectively 
revenues attributable to the acquired in process technology were assumed to increase  depending on the product  between the first two to five years of six to seven year projection periods at annual rates ranging from to before decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from to as other products are released in the marketplace 
projected annual revenue attributable to the products ranged from approximately million to million over the term of the projections 
these projections were based on aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  giving consideration to transaction volumes and prices  anticipated growth rates for the client server market  anticipated product development and product introduction cycles  and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
projected revenues from the in process research and development were assumed to peak during periods between and  depending on the product  and decline from to as other new products are expected to enter the market 
gross profit was assumed to increase in the first two to five years of the projection period  depending on the product  at annual rates ranging from to  decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from to annually  resulting in annual gross profits ranging from approximately million to million 
increases and decreases in gross profit are assumed to move in tandem with increases and decreases in revenue 
the gross profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately the same as the revenue growth rate 
the assumption model s expected gross profit percentage was used consistently throughout the respective periods 
operating profit was assumed to increase depending on the product  in the first two to four years of the projection period at annual rates ranging between and due to an expected operating loss in the first year of one of the projects  and decrease over the remaining years at rates between and annually  resulting in annual operating profits of approximately million to million 
general and administrative expenses are assumed to move in tandem with increases and decreases in revenue 
selling and marketing expenses are expected to decline over time compared to revenues due to general business trends associated with the life cycle of the product 
operating profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately the same as the revenue growth rate 
the company used discount rates ranging from to for valuing the in process research and development acquired in these transactions  which the company believes reflected the risk associated with the completion of the individual research and development projects acquired and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to the completion of the projects 
a description of the in process research and development and the estimates made by the company for each of epicon  insignia  apm  vdonet and viewsoft is summarized below

the actual and estimated costs to complete and completion dates of the in process and core technology acquired or licensed for each acquisition are as follows epicon insignia apm vdonet viewsoft in thousands date acquired licensed january february june july july cost incurred to date      estimated cost to complete   total estimated project cost      estimated cost to complete at date of valuation   estimated completion date at date of valuation first quarter first quarter first quarter second quarter fourth quarter of of of of of current estimated completion date completed in completed in third quarter third quarter third quarter first quarter second quarter of of of of of the estimated completion date of the in process and core technology related to the apm acquisition has been extended as certain personnel working on this project have been allocated to other projects 
the completion date of the in process and core technology acquired from vdonet has been delayed from the originally anticipated completion date due to changes in the development of these technologies resulting from end user feedback 
the estimated completion date of the viewsoft project has been delayed from the originally anticipated completion date due to increases in project scope and a longer testing period 
the company is currently unable to determine the impact of such delays on its business  future results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with completing these projects or that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop these technologies 
interest and other income 
the increase in interest and other income in was primarily due to interest earned on the invested net proceeds from the issuance of the zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures in march the company may acquire or make investments in companies it believes are related to its strategic objectives 
such investments will reduce the company s cash and or investment balances and therefore may reduce interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense in was primarily due to interest related to the zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures issued in march income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate amounted to in  and in july  the company changed its organizational structure whereby it moved certain operational and administrative processes to overseas subsidiaries 
the company provides current income taxes on foreign earnings as if those earnings will be repatriated 
the company is in the process of evaluating what amount  if any  of the foreign earnings that will be permanently reinvested 
based on the results of the company s evaluation process  the level of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings may change and may significantly impact results of operations in the period of change 
liquidity and capital resources during  cash provided by operating activities was million related primarily to net income of million  tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of million due to increased marketing expenses  accrued taxes and royalty fees and an increase in product returns of million primarily due to product swaps caused by the release of metaframe and the overall increase in the company s revenues

the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance upon strategic relationship with microsoft microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems 
citrix depends upon the license of key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses and technical support 
citrix also depends upon its strategic alliance agreement with microsoft pursuant to which the company and microsoft have agreed to cooperate to develop advanced operating systems and promote windows application program interfaces 
the company s relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties competition with microsoft 
nt terminal server is  and future product offerings by microsoft may be  competitive with citrix s current winframe and metaframe products  and any future product offerings by citrix 
expiration of microsoft s endorsement of the ica protocol 
microsoft s obligation to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred method to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows clients expired in november microsoft may now market or endorse other methods to provide multi user windows access to non windows client devices 
dependence on microsoft for commercialization 
citrix s ability to successfully commercialize its metaframe product depends on microsoft s ability to market nt terminal server products 
citrix does not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to the company s knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
product release delays 
there may be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of nt terminal server 
dependence upon broad based acceptance of ica protocol citrix believes that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its ability to make ica protocol a widely accepted standard for supporting windows applications 
if another standard emerges or if the company otherwise fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft includes as a component of nt terminal server its remote desktop protocol rdp which has certain of the capabilities of the company s ica protocol  and may offer customers a competitive solution 
the company believes that its success is dependent on its ability to enhance and differentiate its ica protocol  and foster broad acceptance of the ica protocol based on its performance  scalability  reliability and enhanced features 
in addition  the company s ability to win broad market acceptance of its ica protocol will depend upon the degree of success achieved by its strategic partners in marketing their respective platforms  product pricing and customers assessment of its technical  managerial service and support expertise 
if another standard emerges or if the company fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon strategic relationships in addition to its relationship with microsoft  the company has strategic relationships with ibm  compaq  hewlett packard and others 
the company depends upon its strategic partners to successfully incorporate the company s technology into their products and to market and sell such products 
if the company is unable to maintain its current strategic relationships or develop additional strategic relationships  or if any of its key strategic partners are unsuccessful at incorporating its technology into their products or marketing or selling such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition the markets in which citrix competes are intensely competitive 
most of its competitors and potential competitors  including microsoft  have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
the announcement of the release and the actual release of products competitive with the company s existing and future product lines  such as nt terminal server and related enhancements  could cause existing and potential customers of the company to postpone or cancel plans to license the company s product lines 
this would adversely impact the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company s ability to market ica  metaframe and other future product offerings may be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices implementing the company s product offerings which attach to nt terminal server 
in addition  alternative products exist for internet commerce that directly or indirectly compete with the company s products 
existing or new products that extend website software to provide database access or interactive computing can materially impact the company s ability to sell its products in this market 
as markets for the company s products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries  may enter the markets in which the company competes and further intensify competition 
finally  although the company believes that price has historically been a less significant competitive factor than product performance  reliability and functionality  the company believes that price competition may become more significant in the future 
the company may not be able to maintain its historic prices  and any inability to do so could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology citrix relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
the company s efforts to protect its proprietary technology rights may not be successful 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  tradename  or copyright could have a material adverse effect on the company 
despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to obtain and use information regarded as proprietary 
a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from the licensing of its products under a shrink wrap license agreement that is not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the company s ability to protect its proprietary rights may be affected by the following differences in international law 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
third party infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
this may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such third parties 
such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
product concentration the company anticipates that its metaframe product line and related enhancements will constitute the majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to generate revenue from its metaframe product will depend upon market acceptance of nt terminal server products 
the company expects that revenue from metaframe based products will constitute an increasing percentage of total revenue in the near future and that revenue from winframe based products will continue to decrease over time as a percentage of total revenue 
declines in demand for products based on metaframe technology may occur as a result of new competitive product releases  price competition  lack of success of its strategic partners  technological change or other factors 
dependence on key personnel the company s success will depend  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship at any time 
the effective management of the company s anticipated growth will depend  in a large part  upon the company s ability to i retain its highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel  and ii to attract and maintain replacements for and additions to such personnel in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense and may affect the company s ability to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
new products and technological change the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements  including enhancements to certain key technology licensed from microsoft 
these market characteristics will require the company to continually enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
additionally  the company and others may announce new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
the company believes it will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the development  licensing or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to existing products 
this will increase the company s cost of revenues and operating expenses 
the company cannot currently quantify such increase with respect to transactions that have not occurred 
the company may use a substantial portion of its cash and investments to fund these additional costs 
the company may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies and to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
if the company is unable to add additional staff and resources  future enhancement and additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential for undetected errors despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  new products may contain errors after commencement of commercial shipments 
additionally  the company s products depend upon certain third party products which may contain defects and could reduce the performance of the company s products or render them useless 
since the company s products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in the company s products or the products of third parties upon which the company s products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by the company s customers 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company does not control its distributors and resellers 
additionally  the company s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from the company and may also represent other lines of products 
need to expand channels of distribution the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its direct sales force and add third party distributors both domestically and internationally 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce the company s profits 
need to attract large enterprise customers the company intends to attract and service large enterprise customers by expanding its direct sales force and offering consulting services 
the company s inability to attract large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles which could negatively impact our revenues 
further  as the company attempts to attract large enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding activities which will increase our operating expenses  but may not proportionally increase our operating revenues 
maintenance of growth rate the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the levels attained in  and the company s growth during those three years is largely attributable to the introduction of metaframe in mid and winframe in late to the extent revenue growth continues  the company believes that its cost of revenues and certain operating expenses will also increase 
due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  its income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease as a percentage of revenues in in process research and development valuation the company has in the past re evaluated the amounts charged to in process research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing arrangements 
the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission or the accounting profession 
any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission  may materially adversely affect future results of operations through increased amortization expense 
revenue recognition process the company continually re evaluates its programs  including specific license terms and conditions  to market its current and future products and services 
the company may implement new programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to its current and future product lines 
the company may recognize revenues associated with such enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or over the product s life cycle 
the company modified its licensing fees with certain customers to a per usage basis 
the company may implement a different licensing model  in certain circumstances  which would result in the recognition of licensing fees over a longer period which may result in decreasing revenue 
the timing of the implementation of such programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements and other factors will impact the timing of the company s recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with its products  related enhancements and services 
as a result of these factors  the company currently cannot quantify the impact of the re evaluation of its programs on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
product returns and price reductions the company provides certain of its distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product evaluation 
the company also provides certain of its distributors with price protection rights 
to cover these product returns and price protections  the company has established reserves based on its evaluation of historical trends and current circumstances 
these reserves may not be sufficient to cover product returns and price protections in the future  in which case the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
international operations the company s continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
such international operations are subject to certain risks  such as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  dependence on independent distributors and resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic and political conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
volatility of stock price the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of the common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue or earnings growth  analyst reports or recommendations and other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock  regardless of the company s actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions the demand for the company s products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth and higher operating expenses the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations  the number of its employees and the geographic area of its operations 
in addition  the company has completed certain domestic and international acquisitions since october such growth and assimilation of acquired operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
the company believes that it has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions 
however  its systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support its current or future operations 
in addition  the company may not be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for its products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its expanding product line  expand its sales and marketing organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed product 
the company plans to increase its professional staff during as it implements sales  marketing and support and product development efforts  as well as associated administrative systems  to support planned growth 
as a result of this planned growth in the size of its staff  the company believes that it will require additional facilities during although the company believes that the cost of such additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or results of operations  the company anticipates that operating expenses will increase during as a result of its planned growth in staff 
such an increase in operating expenses may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company maintains a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in the company s investment portfolio are not leveraged and are generally classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
the company does not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively
