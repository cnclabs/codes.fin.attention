risk management to minimize the risk of price changes in the natural gas and natural gas liquids markets  kinder morgan uses certain financial instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange  the kansas city board of trade and over the counter markets including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts and fixed price swaps 
kinder morgan is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments but  given their existing credit ratings  does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pursuant to a policy approved by its board of directors  kinder morgan is to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with i pre existing or anticipated physical gas and condensate sales  ii gas purchases and iii system use and storage in order to protect profit margins  and is not to engage in speculative trading 
commodity related activities of the risk management group are monitored by kinder morgan s risk management committee  which is charged with the review and enforcement of the board of directors risk management policy 
the risk management committee reviews the types of hedging instruments used  contract limits and approval levels and may review the pricing and hedging of any or all commodity transactions 
all energy futures  swaps and options are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of these risk management instruments reflects the estimated amounts that kinder morgan would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts 
market quotes are available for substantially all financial instruments used by kinder morgan 
gains and losses on hedging positions are deferred and recognized as gas purchases expense in the periods in which the underlying physical transactions occur 
kinder morgan measures the risk of price changes in the natural gas and natural gas liquids markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
kinder morgan utilizes a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of percent for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a percent probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
instruments evaluated by the model include forward physical gas  storage and transportation contracts and financial products including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
value at risk at december   was million and averaged million for kinder morgan s calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on kinder morgan s portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in kinder morgan s portfolio of derivatives during the year 
as a result of kinder morgan s planned divestiture of certain of its businesses  primarily its commodity marketing business  it is expected that kinder morgan s portfolio of financial instruments held for the purposes of hedging  and corresponding exposure to loss from such instruments  will be smaller in the future 
kinder morgan s treasury department manages interest rate exposure utilizing interest rate swaps  caps or similar derivatives within board established policy 
none of these interest rate derivatives is leveraged 
kinder morgan currently is not hedging its interest rate exposure resulting from its short term borrowings 
the market risk related to short term borrowings from a one percent change in interest rates would result in an approximate million annual impact on pre tax income  based on short term borrowing levels as of march  there are recently issued accounting pronouncements that change the accounting and reporting requirements for certain risk management activities see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements
