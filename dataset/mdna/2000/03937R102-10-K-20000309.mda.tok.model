item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers certain periods when the company operated as the specialty chemical businesses of olin 
however  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been prepared as if the company were a separate entity for all periods discussed 
it should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
sales consist of sales to third parties net of any discounts 
gross margin is defined as sales less cost of goods sold  which includes raw materials  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with the manufacture of the company s various products 
other operating expenses include selling  administration  research and development 
in addition  segment operating income includes the equity in earnings of affiliated companies 
results of operations consolidated years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts sales gross margin selling and administration nonrecurring expenses research and development equity in earnings of affiliated companies interest expense extraordinary gain  net net income basic income per share diluted income per share weighted average common stock outstanding basic diluted notes represents nonrecurring expenses related to an unfavorable arbitration award and the decision to delay construction of a facility in china 
pro forma financial information in january  olin borrowed million and on february   the company assumed this debt from olin 
pro forma net income for and reflects the pro forma effects of borrowings assuming million was outstanding and that the company had seasonal weighted average borrowings related to the water chemicals segment of million at an aggregate effective rate of 
pro forma common stock outstanding represents the number of common shares issued at the distribution date and assumes that such shares were outstanding for all periods prior to the distribution 
see note pro forma financial information unaudited to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
extraordinary gain  net in represents a gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the settlement of a million face value note through a payment of million  net of related taxes of year ended december  compared to sales increased 
the sales increase was due to a increase in volumes partially offset by a decrease in prices 
the increase in volumes was primarily related to the water chemicals segment 
the decrease in pricing was primarily related to the microelectronic chemicals and performance chemicals segments 
gross margin percentage was in and in higher raw materials and manufacturing costs more than offset the impact of higher volumes 
selling and administration expenses  excluding nonrecurring expenses  as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in due to higher sales and lower expenditures 
selling and administration expenses decreased in amount due to the effect of cost cutting initiatives implemented by the company in  which more than offset incremental public company costs 
research and development expenses increased due to higher expenditures associated with the photopolymers business 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased million due to the favorable performance of both of the company s joint ventures 
interest expense was million in compared to pro forma interest expense of million in the decrease was primarily due to lower average working capital borrowings and lower rates on such borrowings than those assumed in the prior year 
the effective tax rate decreased to in from in as a result of higher equity in earnings of affiliated companies  partially offset by lower foreign tax credits 
results for include an extraordinary gain on the extinguishment of debt of million after tax  or per share  and nonrecurring charges of million after tax  or per share 
the company s sales and operating income for are expected to be higher than sales for are expected to be to higher than diluted income per share for is expected to be to higher than these estimates are based upon expected improved financial performance across a number of arch s businesses 
in microelectronic chemicals  the recovery in the semiconductor industry  added new photopolymer product qualifications and actions to improve the short term performance of process chemicals should benefit this segment 
in water chemicals  the company expects improved performance as a result of strategically focusing on our branded business 
as for the performance chemicals segment  recovery in the asian markets should benefit the hydrazine business  and organic growth within the segment is expected to improve results 
the company also expects to derive additional benefits overall from continuing cost reduction initiatives 
year ended december  compared to sales decreased 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in prices and a decrease due to the sales of the surfactants  fluids  non urethane polypropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol collectively  surfactants business and the conversion of the flexible polyol business to a tolling operation 
under the tolling operation  the company does contract manufacturing for a third party who sells the manufactured product to other parties 
gross margin percentage was in and in higher gross margin as a result of the impact of the surfactants supply agreement and the conversion of the polyols business to a tolling operation were primarily the main contributors to the increased gross margin percentage 
excluding the results of the surfactants business which was sold in and the related supply agreement  the gross margin percentage for and would have been and  respectively 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in due to lower sales and higher expenses 
selling and administration expenses increased in amount due to higher administration expenses for information technology systems primarily sap implementation and increased international operating expenses 
research and development expenses decreased due to the consolidation of the foreign research efforts for photopolymers into the us operations and the sale of the surfactants businesses to basf in november the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  resulting from the utilization of higher foreign tax credits and lower state taxes in in november  the company completed a transaction with basf whereby the company received million for the sale of its performance chemicals surfactants business and a three year supply agreement 
of the proceeds received  million was allocated to the sale of the surfactants business based on the fair value of such business and million was allocated to the supply agreement 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
in the supply agreement  the company agreed to reserve production capacity for surfactants products at its brandenburg  kentucky facility and to supply basf with such products in exchange for a million payment made at the time of signing the agreement  plus recovery of all fixed and variable costs during the term of the agreement 
the agreement expires on december  unless extended  the company does not believe it will be extended 
the million payment was recorded as deferred income and is being amortized ratably into operating income over the three year period 
unless the supply agreement is extended beyond  which the company does not expect to happen  no future income will be realized with respect to this supply agreement after december  sales and operating income for each of the years ended december  and include million related to the amortization of deferred income under the supply agreement 
microelectronic chemicals years ended december  in millions results of operations sales operating income loss year ended december  compared to sales decreased and the operating loss decreased in the results were negatively impacted by the depressed performance of the process chemicals product line 
process chemicals reported sales of million and incurred an operating loss of million in compared with sales of million and an operating loss of million in the industry structure in which the process chemicals business operates results in low profitability at present 
the customer group is concentrated and enjoys significant purchasing leverage 
manufacturing overcapacity exists and  unless the industry rationalizes  will exist in the foreseeable future 
this results in unsatisfactory pricing 
in addition  the industry suffers from inefficiencies in manufacturing  asset utilization  logistics  research and development  and selling and administrative costs 
the company has initiated actions to improve process chemicals performance in the near term  which include structural reengineering to eliminate costs  significant improvement in manufacturing operations and better inventory management 
in addition  the company is pursuing other various strategic options 
excluding the impact of the process chemicals product line  sales decreased 
operating income excluding process chemicals improved significantly primarily due to lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives and favorable joint venture performance fuji photo film  which more than offset the effect of slightly lower sales 
year ended december  compared to sales decreased with an operating loss occurring in compared to an operating profit in sales of all products weakened during as the company s businesses were adversely impacted by the poor conditions in the worldwide semiconductor market 
also  major semiconductor customers underwent extended shutdowns and some delayed or canceled fab construction projects resulting in decreased sales 
in addition to the poor market condition of the semiconductor industry  start up costs for the company s new process chemicals facility in belgium and photoresist facility in rhode island  unfavorable operating performance from its foreign affiliate and higher administration expenses for information technology systems sap implementation contributed to the operating loss 
these were slightly offset by lower r d spending resulting from the consolidation of its overseas photopolymers r d operations to existing facilities in the us water chemicals years ended december  in millions results of operations sales operating income year ended december  compared to sales increased and operating income increased 
the increase in sales was attributable to increased volumes from the distribution businesses  superior pool products and hydrochim  and higher bulk export and branded volumes hth r and pace r 
prices were slightly lower compared to last year as lower bulk prices were almost entirely offset by higher average brand prices 
the operating income increase was attributable to the additional sales volumes and favorable joint venture performance which more than offset higher advertising expenses 
the company is currently pursuing a sale of one of its distribution businesses  superior pool products  inc sppi due to its lack of strategic connection with any of arch s other businesses 
sppi had sales and operating income of million and million  respectively  in the company expects to complete a transaction during the second quarter of year ended december  compared to sales increased while operating income decreased 
increased sales from north america branded calcium hypochlorite  higher volumes of pace r brand products chlorinated isocyanurates and higher distribution sales more than offset lower bulk and export volumes and lower prices 
chinese calcium hypochlorite producers increased their exports of product  which disrupted the supply demand balance and affected prices on a worldwide basis 
the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to the decline in calcium hypochlorite prices and higher manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
lower production volumes  higher depreciation expense and other plant costs  legal expenses  along with higher distribution costs in connection with a new customer accounted for the increased operating costs 
performance chemicals years ended december  in millions results of operations sales operating income before nonrecurring expenses nonrecurring expenses operating income year ended december  compared to sales decreased  while operating income decreased 
excluding million of nonrecurring expenses incurred in the third quarter of related to an unfavorable arbitration award and the decision to delay construction of a facility in china  both of which are associated with the biocides product line  operating income decreased primarily due to lower hydrazine hydrate pricing 
performance urethanes and organics sales decreased due to lower pricing and volumes for nonfoam polyols and lower pricing for propylene glycol products combined with lower volumes and pricing in latin america  principally related to the surfactants business 
operating income increased slightly from the prior year as increased contract manufacturing fees  improved domestic product mix and favorable operating expenses due to cost reduction programs more than offset the lower volumes  pricing and higher raw material costs 
biocides sales were higher primarily due to increased volumes related to the anti dandruff  building products and marine paint markets 
operating income before nonrecurring expenses was higher due to the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher international operating expenses 
in addition  manufacturing costs were negatively impacted by an unscheduled outage at the rochester plant during the first quarter of resulting from a severe snowstorm 
hydrazine sales were lower due to lower hydrazine hydrate pricing and volumes caused by poor asian economic conditions and lower ultra puretm sales due to the timing of launch schedules 
operating income decreased from the prior year due to the sales shortfall and an unanticipated  extended plant outage earlier in the year  resulting in unfavorable manufacturing costs 
sulfuric acid sales were comparable to prior year as higher pricing offset lower volumes 
operating income increased primarily as a result of lower manufacturing costs and operating expenses due to cost reduction efforts 
year ended december  compared to sales decreased  while operating income increased 
the sales decrease was attributable primarily to the sale of the surfactants businesses to basf in november and the conversion of the flexible polyols business from a merchant business to a tolling operation 
higher sales of ipbc based biocide  which is used primarily in metalworking and the coatings markets  and copper omadine r biocide  which is used in the marine antifoulant paint market  were partially offset by a decline in volume in the asian anti dandruff agent market along with lower pricing due to the relatively stronger value of the us dollar 
the operating income increase was attributable primarily to the conversion of the flexible polyols business to a tolling operation 
in addition  operating income increased by million due to the conversion of the surfactants business to a contract manufacturing arrangement under a supply agreement with basf which  unless extended  expires on december  this increase along with the profit impact from higher ipbc based biocide and copper omadine r biocide volumes were offset in part by lower anti dandruff agent volumes to the asian market  and higher administration expense for additional international personnel 
in november  the company completed a transaction with basf whereby the company received million for the sale of its performance chemicals surfactants business and a three year supply agreement 
of the proceeds received  million was allocated to the sale of the surfactants business based on the fair value of such business and million was allocated to the supply agreement 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
in the supply agreement  the company agreed to reserve production capacity for surfactants products at its brandenburg  kentucky facility and to supply basf with such products in exchange for a million payment made at the time of signing the agreement  plus recovery of all fixed and variable costs during the term of the agreement 
the agreement expires on december  unless extended  the company does not believe it will be extended 
the million payment was recorded as deferred income and is being amortized ratably into operating income over the three year period 
unless the supply agreement is extended beyond  which the company does not expect to happen  no future income will be realized with respect to this supply agreement after december  sales and operating income for each of the years ended december  and include million related to the amortization of deferred income under the supply agreement 
environmental the establishment and implementation of federal  state and local standards to regulate air and water quality and to govern contamination of land and groundwater has affected  and will continue to affect  substantially all of the company s manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry in general  and particularly on the chemicals industry 
in addition  the implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs 
the company employs waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at its manufacturing sites 
the distribution agreement specifies that the company is only responsible for certain environmental liabilities at the company s current facilities and certain off site locations 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were not material to operating results in  and but may be material to net income in future years 
in  in connection with the sale of the surfactants businesses to basf  a million provision was recorded to provide for future environmental spending at the brandenburg  kentucky site 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were incurred by olin 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
cash outlays for environmental related activities totaled million in  million in and million in during  million million in  million in was spent on capital projects  million million in  million in was spent on normal plant operations  and million million in was spent on remedial activities 
historically  the company has funded its environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expects to do so in the future 
the company s consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   all of which were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
these amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures  any consideration of insurance recoveries or any advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed or if the costs of remediation efforts can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range from to million over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
income taxes the company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets using the enacted tax rates which are expected to apply to taxable income when the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
prior to the distribution  the company s operations were included in the us federal consolidated income tax returns of olin 
the provision for income taxes prior to the distribution includes the company s allocated share of olin s consolidated income tax provision and is calculated on a separate company basis consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
allocated current income taxes payable were settled with olin on a current basis 
olin and the company entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides that olin is responsible for the federal tax liability of the company for each year that the company and its subsidiaries were included in olin s consolidated federal income tax return  and for state  local and foreign taxes of the company and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to the distribution  in each case including tax subsequently assessed pursuant to the audit of  or other adjustment to  previously filed tax returns 
liquidity  investment activity and other financial data cash flows from operations supplemented by the company s credit facility were used to finance the company s working capital requirements and capital and investment projects 
prior and up to the distribution  the company s financing requirements were provided by olin 
cash flow data years ended december  in millions provided by used for net operating activities capital expenditures net investing activities net financing activities for the year  the reduction in cash flow provided by net operating activities was primarily attributable to higher accounts receivable due to increased fourth quarter sales and an increase in the overall days sales outstanding as compared to for the year  the increase in cash flow from net operating activities was primarily attributable to a reduced investment in working capital 
lower accounts receivable levels due primarily from exiting the merchant flexible polyols business and the lower accounts receivable and reduced sales resulting from the depressed semiconductor industry  as well as the company s ability to manage its inventory in response to the decreased demand  were the main contributors to the reduced investment in working capital 
these more than offset the effect of lower net income and basf payments received in in november  the company completed a transaction with basf whereby the company received million for the sale of its performance chemicals surfactants business and a three year supply agreement 
capital spending for the year decreased compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the completion of certain capital projects in the microelectronic chemicals segment in the prior year and as a result of the company s focus on reducing capital spending levels 
in september  the company purchased the hydroquinone di beta hydroxyethyl ether hqee specialty chemicals business from eastman chemical company of kingsport  tennessee 
capital spending for the year increased over the prior year 
in microelectronic chemicals  there were three major capital projects an ultra high purity chemicals plant and distribution center in zwijndrecht  belgium to better serve the semiconductor industry in europe  a photoresist facility in north kingston  rhode island to support the rapid commercialization of advanced photoresist products and a diffusion facility in mesa  arizona which will replace an existing facility and support the development of advanced semiconductor devices 
the high purity chemicals plant in belgium started up operations in the third quarter of  the photoresist facility in rhode island started up operations in the fourth quarter of while the diffusion facility started up during these three projects represent a total investment of approximately million  of which approximately million was spent during during  million was spent at the rochester  new york  swords  ireland  and suzhou  china facilities related to the expanded capacity for key intermediate materials 
capital spending for is expected to be in the million range 
cash provided by financing in was due to increased borrowings associated with higher working capital requirements  dividends paid to shareholders of million  and million used to repurchase common stock 
net financing activities in and related to intercompany activity with olin 
on january   olin obtained an unsecured million revolving five year credit facility  which expires in january and an unsecured million  day facility  which expired in january collectively  the credit facility 
olin borrowed million under the credit facility 
on february   the company succeeded to the credit facility and assumed the million of debt 
the unsecured million  day facility was renewed by the company under the same terms  and now expires in january the credit facility contains leverage and interest coverage ratio covenants  and restricts the payment of dividends in excess of million plus of cumulative net income under certain circumstances 
fees are payable on the credit facility and range from to 
the company may select various floating rate borrowing options  including but not limited to  libor plus to and the prime rate 
at december   the company had million of available borrowings under this credit facility 
the company believes that the credit facility is adequate to satisfy its liquidity needs for the near future 
arch also currently has approximately million of uncommitted lines of credit 
on october   arch s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program whereby the company is authorized to buy back up to million shares of its common stock  representing approximately of outstanding shares 
through december   the company had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at a cost of million 
the company believes that its current financing ability and liquidity are more than adequate to fund this program and allow it to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
new accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect this statement will have on its financial position and results of operations in the period of adoption 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on the company s business  operations  or financial position 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into forward sales and purchase contracts and currency options to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally euro  canadian dollar and japanese yen and relating to particular anticipated but not yet committed purchases and sales expected to be denominated in those currencies 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december   the company had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies with face values of million million and forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with face values of million million 
at december  and the company had no outstanding option contracts to sell or buy foreign currencies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  foreign currency translation  a transaction is classified as a hedge when the foreign currency transaction is designated as  and is effective as  a hedge of a foreign currency commitment and the foreign currency commitment is firm 
a hedge is considered by the company to be effective when the transaction reduces the currency risk on its foreign currency commitments 
if a transaction does not meet the criteria to qualify as a hedge  it is considered to be speculative 
for a foreign currency commitment that is classified as a hedge  any gain or loss on the commitment is deferred and included in the basis of the underlying instrument 
any realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with foreign currency commitments that are classified as speculative are recognized in the current period and are included in selling and administration in the consolidated statements of income 
if a foreign currency transaction previously considered as a hedge is terminated before the transaction date of the related commitment  any deferred gain or loss shall continue to be deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
premiums paid for currency options and gains or losses on forward sales and purchase contracts are not material to operating results 
year computer systems the company s year initiatives have been successful to date 
the company s approach was to subdivide its year program into four distinct segments business systems  manufacturing  supply chain  and infrastructure 
the company has transitioned all of its systems to the new millennium without experiencing significant problems in any of its business systems  manufacturing  supply chain or infrastructure areas 
in addition  the company believes it has identified  tested and developed a plan to respond to all known year concerns in accordance with its contractural obligations and operational requirements 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its customers or suppliers 
therefore  management believes it has minimized its risk related to future exposure concerning year issues 
the company intends to continue to monitor year issues and does not believe such future costs will be material to the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from its credit facility which is based upon various floating rates 
based upon the expected levels of borrowings under this facility in  an increase in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows approximately million 
foreign currency risk the company operates manufacturing facilities in six countries and sells products in over countries 
approximately percent of the company s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company is subject to risks associated with these foreign operations  including currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
these exposures from foreign exchange fluctuations can affect the company s equity investments and its respective share of earnings losses  the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries  translation of the company s foreign operations for us gaap reporting purposes and from purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company enters into forward sales and purchase contracts and currency options to manage currency risk from actual and anticipated purchase and sales commitments denominated or expected to be denominated in a foreign currency principally euro  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
it is the company s policy to hedge approximately to of these transactions 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
the counterparties to the options and contracts are major financial institutions 
at december   the company had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies with face values of million and forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with face values of million 
the fair values of these forward contracts approximated face values 
holding other variables constant  if there was a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the net effect on the company s cash flows would be a decrease of between million to million  as any increase decrease in cash flows resulting from the company s hedged forward contracts would be offset by an equal increase decrease in cash flows on the underlying transaction being hedged
