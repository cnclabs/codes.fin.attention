if the market does not continue to grow and move toward value priced products  revenues and earnings will likely continue to be adversely impacted 
the company s gross margin is a sensitive function of the product mix sold  pricing and the market conditions in any given period 
as a result of the company s skate attack brand being sold to the mass merchant customers  the product is more like a commodity and generally has lower gross margin percentages than the company s ultrawheels brand and hespeler hockey products 
as a result  future gross margin percentages are difficult to predict 
while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook 
competition 
the company competes with numerous manufacturers of in line skates domestically and internationally  and anticipates future competition from other large and well established sporting goods manufacturers 
k and rollerblade are the company s primary competitors and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the intense price competition in the in line skate market has put pressure on the company s profit margins 
the company s ability to remain competitive in the in line skate market depends on several factors including its ability to i offer innovative products at commercially acceptable prices  ii develop new innovative products and generate market demand for such products  and iii continue to develop and expand its international business 
dependence on key customers 
during the fiscal year ended february   sales to wal mart accounted for of the company s revenues 
increased competition from other manufacturers  decreased demand for the company s products or other circumstances may have an adverse impact upon the company s relationship with wal mart and or other major customers 
decreased orders from this customer or other major customers would have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
other 
the company s products are primarily used outdoors and therefore adverse weather conditions can have a negative impact on consumer demand 
because the company s products are of a recreational nature and not considered basic necessities  a general decline in overall economic conditions may have a greater adverse effect on the company s sales 
market risk 
the company s sales and results of operations are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s foreign operations are in countries with fairly stable currencies  therefore  the effect of foreign currencies has not been significant 
the company attempts to limit its exposure to translation gains and losses by maintaining and controlling its foreign cash flows whenever possible 
considering both the anticipated foreign sales and results of operations for the next year  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected fiscal sales and results of operations
