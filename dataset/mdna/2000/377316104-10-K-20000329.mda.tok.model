overview the company classifies its sales into two product groups engineered papers including tobacco papers and specialized printing papers 
the glatfelter division  which includes the spring grove  pennsylvania and neenah  wisconsin paper mills  produces both specialized printing and engineered papers 
the ecusta division is comprised of the pisgah forest  north carolina paper mill ecusta as well as other various supporting facilities 
schoeller hoesch s h includes paper mills in gernsbach  germany and near odet  france 
both ecusta and s h produce specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
s h was acquired on january  overall  demand and pricing for the company s products strengthened throughout after the first quarter of  the company experienced only normal seasonal downtime 
demand for the company s tobacco papers  however  continued to be very weak during this portion of the company s business has suffered from extremely low pricing in recent years as a result of industry overcapacity and declining domestic consumption 
to combat such depressed pricing  the company announced in september that it had notified its major tobacco paper customers that  effective january   prices would be increased for certain of its tobacco paper products 
this initiative was required for the company to remain a viable  high quality supplier to its customers 
as a result of this announcement  the company expected that certain of its tobacco paper customers would seek other  lower quality suppliers 
in fact  this has happened 
as a result  the company announced in december that it would begin reducing its tobacco paper manufacturing capacity at its ecusta division during although the extent of the reduction is uncertain  capacity could be reduced by up to one third and the workforce reduced by approximately people 
such workforce reductions will be realized through a combination of early retirements and layoffs 
because the extent of the sales volume losses could not be reliably estimated as of the balance sheet date  the company has not recognized a one time charge associated with the workforce reduction or a one time charge  if any  associated with the idling of equipment 
such a charge  which will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  will be recognized in the first half of to offset the loss of such tobacco paper volume  the company is planning to grow its specialized printing and engineered papers businesses and has invested resources into its new product development area 
despite this  the company expects that the reduction of its tobacco paper producing capacity will reduce its total sales volume in the near term 
the company is making vigorous efforts to remove substantially all costs associated with this loss of business as capacity is reduced 
markets for the company s other engineered papers  excluding tobacco papers  remained strong throughout demand was stable and pricing was consistent 
the company s net sales volume of other engineered papers increased by in the fourth quarter of versus the first quarter of  a result of improved demand for the company s existing products 
most of the company s specialized printing paper products are directed at the uncoated free sheet portion of the industry 
the demand for such products was relatively weak early in the year  with demand steadily improving thereafter 
concurrent with this improving demand  the company was able to implement various price increases for its specialized printing paper products in the company announced a price increase for a substantial number of its specialized printing papers effective in early february early indications are that additional price increases may be forthcoming in partially offsetting the positive financial impact of these price increases are increases in the cost of certain of the company s raw materials  especially market pulp and wastepaper 
major producers of market pulp have implemented price increases effective in january  and the company expects additional price increases in the coming months 
since pricing for many of the company s products typically follows that of market pulp  the company also expects improved pricing for such products subsequent to any market pulp price increases 
furthermore  because certain of the company s operations are not entirely dependent on external sources of pulp  especially its vertically integrated spring grove  pennsylvania pulp and paper mill  such increases in fiber prices are generally favorable to the company s results of operations 
compared to overall  net sales in decreased  or  compared to though net sales volume was higher in versus  average net pricing was lower in sales of specialized printing papers were lower in than by as a result of weak demand and pricing for such products early in throughout the remainder of  the company was able to implement several price increases as demand and pricing improved during the year 
as a result of these price increases  average net pricing for such products was higher in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of the company announced additional price increases for many of these products early in and continues to maintain a healthy backlog of orders 
the company expects that pricing will continue to improve  though at a somewhat slower rate  in compared to sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers increased by in versus  as an increase in net sales volume was partially offset by a decrease in average net selling price 
the increase in volume was largely a result of successfully marketing certain of the company s existing products 
as mentioned above  the company  along with much of the rest of the paper industry  experienced weakness in demand for many of its products early in as a result  the company accepted orders for certain of its products with lower average net selling prices 
the decrease in average net selling price for the year  therefore  is almost entirely a result of a change in mix of products sold and not a weakening of prices for specific products 
the cost of products sold decreased by in compared to as the company reported in see unusual item below  it has taken aggressive steps to remove costs from its business which has led to the lower cost of products sold 
further  an increase in operational efficiency at many of the company s operating locations was realized as a result of an improving and more stable order pattern for many of the company s products 
in addition  market pulp prices  a key raw material in the company s business  were lower  on average  than in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  in versus was primarily a result of additional spending on legal and professional services relating to certain environmental and other matters 
profit from operations before interest income and expense and taxes was  in compared to  excluding the unusual item in this decrease was largely due to the decrease in net sales in versus  partially offset by a decrease in cost of products sold 
interest on investments and other net remained flat from to the company s average cash holdings in were higher than in  yielding higher interest income 
offsetting this was interest income realized in on a trust held to defease certain of the company s debt 
the defeasance trust was liquidated early in and no such income was realized in gain from property dispositions  etc 
net increased from  in to  in in the first quarter of  the company sold a tract of timberland  realizing a gain of  during the remaining quarters of  the company sold various other fully depreciated items  in addition to the rights to standing timber on select tracts of land 
subsequent to the first quarter of  no single sale was material to the company s results of operations 
no significant sales of such property occurred in from time to time  the company divests certain tracts of its timberlands when it is offered attractive prices 
the company does not actively solicit the sale of its timberlands as it intends to maintain its own sources of raw materials 
interest on debt was  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower average borrowings and generally lower interest rates experienced in versus such lower average borrowings were partially a result of the company s repayment of its  principal amount notes early in as well as strengthening of the us dollar relative to the dm during compared to net sales in increased  or  compared to net sales volume and average selling prices decreased at the company s glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the resulting decrease in net sales at these divisions was more than offset by the net sales of s h 
sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers increased by in versus this increase was due to the inclusion of s h in s results 
overall  the sales volume of engineered papers increased by 
the average net selling price per ton for the company s engineered papers increased significantly due to a shift in product mix 
s h produces and sells lightweight papers and  as a result  has higher average net selling prices per ton than those of the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the average net selling price per ton of tobacco papers decreased in versus overall  tobacco paper sales volume increased due to the inclusion of s h s results in specialized printing paper sales were down less than in versus this decrease was due to lower printing paper sales volume 
average net selling prices per ton increased slightly 
this increase was entirely due to a change in product mix 
average selling prices per ton for non s h printing papers decreased slightly in compared to the cost of products sold for the glatfelter and ecusta divisions decreased due to a decrease in sales volume and lower costs for certain raw materials in compared to raw material costs had a slightly favorable effect on the company s relative performance in compared to as cost per ton for the company s principal raw materials  market pulp and wastepaper  decreased in versus the company also benefited in from cost savings achieved through the start up of the spring grove mill s precipitated calcium carbonate pcc plant 
this plant reduced the cost of pcc at this mill as well as lowered the need for higher priced raw materials used for increasing the opacity and brightness of certain papers 
the cost of sales per unit decreased at the glatfelter division in versus due primarily to lower raw material costs 
the cost of sales per unit at the ecusta division increased in as compared to this increase was mainly due to the amount of market related down time taken at the ecusta division and the resulting absorption of fixed costs over fewer units produced 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  in versus this increase was due to the selling  general and administrative expenses related to s h  offset somewhat by a decrease in such expenses at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
s h has higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of higher selling costs incurred in delivering product to its customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the company were and of net sales for and  respectively 
profit from operations before the unusual item  interest income and expense and taxes was  in compared to  in this increase was due to the incremental operating results of s h which more than offset decreases in profit from operations before the unusual item  interest income and expense and taxes at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the decreases at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions were the result of a decrease in net sales  offset somewhat by a decrease in cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in net sales at these two divisions in as compared to was primarily due to reduced sales volumes  exacerbated somewhat by a decrease in average selling price per ton 
interest on investments and other net decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in investment income in compared to in  the proceeds from the issuance of  of step down preferred stock by a subsidiary  gws valuch  inc  were placed in trust and invested in interest bearing marketable securities  resulting in a significant increase in interest income 
the trust was liquidated in early this transaction is described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
gain from property dispositions  etc 
net decreased from  in to  in during the second quarter of  the company completed the sale of a parcel of recreational property near its ecusta mill resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately  no property sales of this magnitude were included in the results 
interest on debt was  in compared to  in the primary reason for this increase was the company s higher net borrowing level during the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of  in part due to the borrowings of approximately  under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of s h 
the company repaid its  principal amount of its notes on march  unusual item during  the company recognized a pre tax charge of  related primarily to the accrual of pension and medical benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees of the ecusta division and certain salaried employees of the glatfelter division who elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement enhancement program 
the pre tax charge also included the cost of termination of several glatfelter division salaried employees which was necessary to achieve the company s cost savings goals 
the total after tax effect of the unusual item for the year was  or 
per share 
acquisition of schoeller hoesch on january   the company acquired s h which currently owns and operates paper mills in gernsbach  germany and near odet  france 
s h also owns a pulpmill in the philippines which supplies abaca pulp to s h s paper mills and owns and operates a facility in wisches  france 
s h primarily manufactures engineered papers and has the leading position in the world tea bag paper market 
it also manufactures other engineered papers including tobacco  metalized  stencil  filter and casing papers  as well as some specialized printing papers 
the acquisition of s h provided the company with a strong business position in the world tea bag paper market and a presence in other long fiber markets  such as stencil  filter and casing papers 
it also strengthened the company s tobacco papers business by providing a manufacturing presence in europe and a significant share of the european tobacco papers market  plus the ability to manufacture and market ultraporous plug wrap  a growing segment of the world tobacco papers market 
financial condition liquidity during  the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by  principally due to cash provided from operations of  such cash generation was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of  mainly for additions to plant  equipment and timberlands and the acquisition of the remaining interest in cascadec  and cash used in financing activities of  primarily for dividend payments 
the company expects to meet all its near and long term cash needs from a combination of internally generated funds  cash  cash equivalents and its existing revolving credit facility or other bank lines of credit  and  if prudent  other long term debt 
the company is subject to certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility 
the company is in compliance with all such covenants 
interest rate risk the company uses its revolving credit facility and notes to finance a significant portion of its operations 
the revolving credit facility provides for variable rates of interest and exposes the company to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the dm london interbank offered rate 
the company uses off balance sheet interest rate swap agreements to hedge partially interest rate exposure associated with the revolving credit facility 
all of the company s derivative financial instrument transactions are entered into for non trading purposes 
to the extent that the company s financial instruments expose the company to interest rate risk and market risk  they are presented in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity for the company s revolving credit facility and notes as of december  for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents notional amounts and the related reference interest rates by year of maturity 
fair values included herein have been determined based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  and estimates obtained from dealers to settle interest rate swap agreements 
the table should be read in conjunction with notes and to the consolidated financial statements dollar amounts in thousands

in an effort to reduce its net debt  the company has made a chief goal of minimizing capital spending  allotting only sufficient funds to maintain existing operations and for modest  high return capital improvements 
the company will remain in this highly discriminating spending mode at least through and possibly thereafter 
capital spending is expected to be approximately  in environmental matters the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from regulation by various federal  state  local and foreign governmental authorities with respect to the environmental impact of air and water emissions and noise from its mills  as well as the disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
to comply with environmental laws and regulations  the company has incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures in past years 
during  and  the company incurred approximately   and  respectively  in operating costs related to complying with environmental laws and regulations 
the company anticipates that environmental regulation of its operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures will continue  and perhaps increase  in the future 
in addition  the company may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment resulting from its operations  including the restoration of natural resources  and liability for personal injury and damage to property  including natural resources 
in particular  the company continues to negotiate with epa and dep regarding the novs under the federal and state air pollution control laws and with the state of wisconsin and the united states regarding natural resources damages and response costs related to the discharge of pcbs and other hazardous substances in the lower fox river  on which the company s neenah mill is located 
the costs associated with such matters are presently unknown but could be substantial and perhaps exceed the company s available resources 
the company s current assessment  after consultation with legal counsel  is that ultimately it should be able to resolve these environmental matters without a long term material adverse impact on the company 
in the meantime  however  these matters could  at any particular time or for any particular period  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to these matters or that such obligations will not have a long term material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
environmental achievements on april   the company announced that its spring grove mill was the first pulp and paper mill in the united states to achieve iso certification for its environmental management system and its commitment to environmental excellence 
iso requires that an organization have an environmental policy that includes commitments to prevention of pollution  compliance with environmental laws and regulations and continual improvements in its environmental management system 
as a part of maintaining its certification  the mill s environmental management system will be assessed by a third party on an ongoing  periodic basis 
the company s gernsbach  germany facility is also iso certified 
the company plans to achieve iso certification at all of its other mills by the end of also on april   the company announced its new century project 
the new century project is a commitment by the company to participate at its spring grove mill in epa s advanced technology incentive program under the cluster rules 
as a result  the company expects to spend approximately  prior to april to eliminate the use of elemental chlorine in its bleaching process  reduce odor emissions and improve water quality 
the new century project demonstrates the company s commitment to minimizing its impact on natural resources 
year the company s efforts to achieve year compliance for its information technology systems and non information technology systems have been successful to date 
the company experienced essentially no problems as a result of the year date change on december  further  the company was not negatively impacted by any noncompliance by its key vendors  suppliers or customers 
the company dedicated a substantial portion of the resources of its internal information technology employees to achieve year compliance 
including primarily normal wage  benefit and related costs for its ordinary complement of information technology personnel  the company expensed approximately   and  during  and  respectively  on this project 
the company made only minor capital expenditures to replace certain systems or equipment that were not year compliant 
the company incurred approximately  in capital related costs during to achieve year compliance 
while the company will continue to monitor its systems  as well as its interaction with vendors  suppliers and customers  for potential year noncompliance through the remainder of  the company has redeployed the resources associated with its information technology employees to the development and implementation of strategic information systems
