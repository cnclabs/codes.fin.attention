the company is currently in discussions with the unsecured revolving loan lender to obtain a waiver and or amend the loan  however  there can be no assurance as to whether and when the company will obtain any such waiver or amendment 
furthermore  the company s failure to obtain from its independent auditor s an unqualified report with respect to its consolidated financial statements will also constitute a default under these two credit facilities 
in addition  noncompliance with the covenants described above has triggered certain cross default provisions with respect to several of the company s other debt instruments  including the subordinated loan  the  term loan and the fixed rate bonds 
none of these loans have been accelerated nor was a notice of the respective lender s intent to accelerate received by the company 
management is currently in discussion with the affected lenders to obtain a resolution of the cross default provisions 
if the company is unable to obtain such waiver or amendment to the unsecured revolving loan and reach resolution with certain other lenders  the company will look to i obtain alternative financing from other financial institutions  or ii the potential sale of assets or a joint venture interest in certain outlet centers as sources of cash to repay the amounts outstanding under such loans 
this condition raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
although the company continues to maintain its regularly scheduled payments under all of its indebtedness  there can be no assurance that one or all of the affected lenders will not declare a default and accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be in compliance with its financial debt covenants in future periods since the company s future financial performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  the effects of increases in market interest rates from current levels  the risk of potential increases in vacancy rates and the resulting impact on the company s revenue  and risks associated with refinancing the company s current debt obligations or obtain new financing under terms as favorable as the company has experienced in prior periods

funds from operations management believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the company s operating results  funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income loss presented in accordance with gaap 
in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit established guidelines clarifying the definition of ffo 
ffo is defined as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales of property and discontinued operations  plus depreciation and amortization after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes that ffo is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of reits which provides a relevant basis for comparison to other reits 
therefore  ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
the company s ffo is not comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than does the company 
therefore  the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions
