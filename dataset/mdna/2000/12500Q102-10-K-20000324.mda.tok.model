item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this form k contains certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result  among other factors  of changes in general  national or regional economic conditions  changes in loan default and charge off rates  reductions in deposit levels necessitating increased borrowing to fund loans and investments  changes in interest rates  changes in the size and nature of the company s competition  uncertainties relating to the ability of the company and its suppliers  vendors and other third parties to resolve year issues in a timely manner  and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
additional factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those described under risk factors 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included within this report 
given that the company s principal activity currently is ownership of the bank  for ease of reference  the term company in this item generally will refer to the investments and activities of the company and the bank  except where otherwise noted 
cape cod bank and trust company  na is the largest commercial bank headquartered on cape cod in barnstable county  massachusetts 
the bank s twenty six banking offices are principally engaged in accepting deposits from individuals and businesses  and in making loans 
the bank also has a substantial trust department  managing assets in excess of million at december  on behalf of its clients 
the bank s market area includes a significant and growing retirement population  and is heavily dependent on the tourist and vacation businesses 
compared with source and use of funds 
at year end  total deposits of  were greater than the prior year end 
demand deposits increased  or and now deposits increased  or 
money market accounts and other savings declined by  or and  or  respectively  while certificates of deposit greater than  doubled  from  at year end to  at year end this significant growth of large cds began in august and continued throughout the last trimester of the year 
management believes that this growth is attributable to highly competitive rates offered during that period while the weaker performance of other deposit types occurred largely in december and may have been related to customer s year concerns 
on average for the year  total deposits of  exceeded the prior year average by nearly  led by greater average demand deposits  up  or  now accounts  up  or  and large denomination cds  up  or 
management believes that these averages reflect the strong economy on the cape during as well  additional funds were raised through increased borrowings  notably the fhlb 
while fhlb borrowings increased only modestly from year end to year end  average outstandings increased  or over the comparable as the bank continued to take long term advances to support fixed rate lending as well as to take shorter term advances for the continued purpose of making high quality investments with short effective duration 
at year end  loans totalled  reflecting growth of  or over the year end 
loans secured by real estate  including residential first mortgages  up  or and construction loans  up  or accounted for this growth  as well as did increased commercial loans  up  or in the latter weeks of the year 
these growth statistics also reflect the strong cape cod economy during on average  loans were  or greater during than during  with most of that change occurring in residential mortgage outstandings 
also on the asset side  securities averaged significantly higher during as compared to  up  or reflecting utilization of the fhlb advances taken down for this purpose 
in contrast  however  year end securities were  or lower than the year end comparable  as management used maturities and paydowns to reduce fhlb advances  to respond to the late year growth of commercial loans and to provide extra cash to respond to unusual customer demands that might have arisen in relation to year concerns 
net interest income 
on average  interest rates were lower in than they were in  which decreased the yields on the bank s loans 
the cost of the bank s deposits and borrowings also decreased by a comparable amount 
because of the positive spread between the return on earning assets and the cost of funds  as well as the overall growth of deposits  borrowings  loans and investments discussed above  the bank s net interest income increased 
accordingly  net interest income increased by  an increase of 
provision for possible loan losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off exceeded charge offs during management determined that additions to the reserve for possible loan losses were unnecessary in  notwithstanding the growth in the loan portfolio 
management believes that the reserve is adequate to cover the losses likely to result from loans in the current portfolio 
see reserve for loan losses below 
other income and expense 
non interest income increased  or on increased financial advisor trust fees  greater credit card merchant fees and the sale of the credit card merchant portfolio which in itself produced a pretax gain of  operating expenses increased  or over with most of this increase reflected in salaries and benefits expenses 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of higher pretax income  the provisions for income taxes increased by 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for was  an increase of from the previous year 
compared with source and use of funds 
although at year end total deposits were  higher than a year earlier  an increase of  on average total deposits in were  more than in  an increase of 
all deposit categories were higher on average during the year 
demand deposits were higher by  on average  an increase of 
management believes that this was the result of a continued strong economic climate in its market area 
now account deposits were higher by  on average  an increase of 
money market account deposits were higher by  on average  an increase of 
other savings deposits were higher by  on average  an increase of 
certificates of deposit of  or more were higher by  on average  an increase of 
other time deposits were higher by  on average  an increase of 
additional funds were raised from increased borrowings 
borrowings from the federal home loan bank were  higher on average  an increase of  as the company continued to take long term advances to offset the interest rate risk of fixed rate commercial mortgage lending and increased the level of its short term borrowing for the purpose of making high quality investments with short effective duration 
through these efforts  management is attempting to increase earnings without incurring significant additional risk 
other short term borrowings were higher by  on average  an increase of 
at year end  total loans were  higher than a year earlier  an increase of 
on average for the year  they were  higher  an increase of 
increases in some loan categories were partially offset by declines in others 
residential mortgage loans were higher by  on average  an increase of  as the company continued to increase its market share in this line of business and retained the adjustable rate mortgages that it originated 
commercial mortgage loans were higher by  an increase of 
commercial loans were lower by  on average  a decline of 
industrial revenue bonds were lower  on average  a decline of  and consumer loans were lower by  on average  a decline of  as the result of the sale of the company s credit card portfolio in the fourth quarter of the remaining funds were invested 
total investments were higher by  on average  an increase of  to use the additional funds from federal home loan bank borrowings made for this purpose 
net interest income 
interest rates declined during  which decreased the yields on loans and investments 
the cost of deposits and borrowings also decreased  but by a smaller amount 
because of the positive spread between the return on earning assets and the cost of funds  net interest income increased as a result of the overall growth in deposits  borrowings  loans and investments discussed above 
accordingly  net interest income increased by  an increase of 
provision for possible loan losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off exceeded charge offs and management determined that additions to the reserve for possible loan losses were unnecessary in  notwithstanding the growth in the loan portfolio 
other income and expense 
non interest income decreased by because income had included the receipt of  on the settlement of a dispute with a software provider and a gain of  on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
non interest expense decreased by in large part because of lower expenses related to the conversion of the company s operating system 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of lower income before income taxes  the provision for income taxes decreased by 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for was  a decrease of from the previous year 
maturity structure of assets and liabilities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  fixed rate debt securities and loans mature as follows fixed rate debt securities loans remaining maturity dollar amounts in thousands three months or less   over three months through months   over one year through five years   over five years   totals   included in fixed rate debt securities are  of collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed securities  and other debt securities 
these have been distributed based on estimates of their principal cash flows rather than their contractual final maturities 
the balance  largely fixed rate municipal securities  are distributed on the basis of contractual maturity 
included in loans maturing in three months or less are  of customer account overdrafts 
as of december  floating rate debt securities  fhlb stock and loans reprice as follows floating rate fhlb frb debt securities stock loans repricing frequency dollar amounts in thousands quarterly or more frequently    annually or more frequently  but less frequently than quarterly  every five years or more frequently  but less frequently than annually  less frequently than every five years totals    most residential mortgage loans are adjustable rate mortgages subject to interest rate caps 
the company s investment securities are subject to market risk in the following ways 
 of the investment securities owned as of december  are floating rate instruments tied to various indices  primarily the month treasury bill and libor 
lesser amounts are tied to longer term treasury rates and other indices 
almost all of these floating rate instruments are subject to interest rate caps which range from to 
if interest rates rise enough so that there is a significant possibility that a given security will become subject to its interest rate cap  the market value of that security will be reduced 
this risk is greater to the extent that the remaining life of the investment is longer 
the company s floating rate investments have an average life of about two years 
market risk may also result from the fact that various indices will not always move by the same amount when interest rates increase 
this may cause securities tied to one index to perform less well than securities tied to other indices 
most of the remaining  of securities are fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  mortgage backed securities and other debt securities 
fixed rate investments have market risk because their rate of return does not change at all with the general level of interest rates 
an additional characteristic of cmos is that their principal payments tend to slow when interest rates rise 
if the fixed rate earned on the investment is lower than the new market rate  this can result in a decline in the value of these securities 
almost all of the company s fixed rate cmos have very short lives and have interest rates above current market levels  which reduces the market risk of these securities 
the average life of the company s fixed rate investments is less than two years 
the remaining maturity of time certificates of deposit as of december  was as follows fixed rate certificates of deposit  or more less than  remaining maturity dollar amounts in thousands three months or less   over three months through months   over one year through two years  over two years through three years  over three years through four years over four years through five years over five years totals   other deposits may be withdrawn by the customer without notice or penalty 
the rates paid thereon are reviewed each month and changed at the company s option as often as indicated by changing market conditions 
the remaining maturity of borrowings from the federal home loan bank as of december  was as follows fixed rate fhlb borrowings remaining maturity dollar amounts in thousands three months or less  over three months through months  over one year through five years  over five years  totals  rates paid on other interest bearing liabilities change daily 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is an estimate of the amount necessary to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
this amount is determined by management based on a regular evaluation of the loan portfolio and considers such factors as loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the reserve is an estimate  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings of the periods in which they become known 
some assumptions must be made in order to estimate the extent of losses likely to result from loans in the current portfolio 
although the local economy has been strong in recent years  the national economy may eventually enter into a recession after a long period of expansion 
this could result in a decline in tourism on cape cod negatively affecting the company s borrowers and resulting in higher losses 
the company has also purchased packages of residential mortgage loans which contain loans on properties outside of its market area which may be subject to their own economic risks 
these factors could result in greater losses than are currently expected  in which case  greater provisions for loan losses may prove to be necessary in future periods 
on the other hand  if these factors do not result in significant deterioration to the quality of the loan portfolio  actual losses may be less than the reserve and the excess amount will be recovered by credits to income in future periods 
in addition  the company s reserve for loan losses is periodically reviewed by the occ as part of their examination process 
the occ may require the company to make additions to the reserve based upon judgements different from those of management 
non performing assets and loan loss experience non performing assets as of december     and were as follows dollar amounts in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing property from defaulted loans  total non performing assets      restructured troubled debt performing in accordance with amended terms  not included above    accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when it is questionable whether the borrower will be able to pay principal and interest in full and or when loan payments are days past due unless the loan is fully secured by real estate or other collateral and in the process of collection 
accordingly  for loans which are shown as past due days or more and still accruing  management expects that principal and interest will be repaid in full 
in some instances  the company may also be repaid in full on nonaccrual loans 
loans are classified substandard when they are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the debtor or of the collateral 
at december    of loans were included in this category  in addition to loans reported above 
the company s loan classification system also includes a category for loans which are monitored for possible deterioration in credit quality 
at december    of loans were included in this category 
in addition  it is possible that there may be losses on other loans which have not been specifically identified 
the changes in the reserve for loan losses during the five years ended december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands balance  beginning of year      provision for loan losses charge offs commercial loans construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial loans  construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans balance  end of year      dollar amounts in thousands allocation of ending balance commercial loans      construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans      industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans      consumer loans   balance  end of year      ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding recoveries on loans previously charged off modestly exceeded charge offs and management determined that additions to the reserve for possible loan losses were unnecessary in  notwithstanding the growth in the loan portfolio 
the reserve represented of total loans at december   at december  and at december  although management believes that upon review of loan quality and prepayment statistics  the reserve is adequate to cover losses likely to result from loans in the current portfolio at december   there can be no assurance that the reserve is adequate or that provisions might not become necessary 
liquidity the company normally experiences a wide swing in its liquidity each year as a result of the seasonal nature of the economy in its market area 
liquidity is usually at its high in late summer and early fall and the annual low point is usually in the spring 
with the exception to the year ended december   substantially all of the amount shown as cash and due from banks at year end is made up of checks and similar items in the process of collection or was needed to satisfy a requirement to maintain a portion of deposits in an account at the federal reserve 
accordingly  it does not represent a source of liquidity 
at year end december   however  a portion of cash and due from banks was accumulated to honor potential customer demands arising from year concerns 
the company did not experience these potential customer demands 
in general  investment securities could also be easily sold if necessary to meet liquidity needs 
in that event  a gain or loss would be realized if the market value of the securities sold was not equal to their cost  adjusted for the amortization of premium or accretion of discount 
the bank can also borrow funds using investment securities as collateral  and it has a line of credit of  from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the bank has also established a line of credit for the purchase of federal funds from a regional bank and may borrow from the federal reserve if necessary 
distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  average interest rates and interest spread the average amount outstanding for certain categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest income or expense and the average yields earned or rates paid thereon  are summarized in the following table for the three years ended december  nonaccrual loan balances have been included in their respective loan categories which reduces the calculated yields 
a portion of the income reported in certain of the asset categories is not subject to federal income tax  making it relatively more valuable 
the computed yields shown have not been adjusted for taxable equivalency 
as an indication of the amount of change in the general level of interest rates between years  the average rate on overnight federal funds traded among banks was  and during  and  respectively

these amounts were calculated directly from the amounts included in the preceding table 
the amount allocated to change in volume was calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the average of the interest rates earned or paid in the two periods 
the amount allocated to change in rate was calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the average volume over the two periods 
in  lower interest rates reduced interest expense more than interest income as security portfolio yields were stable to levels overall 
greater volume in also contributed to improved net interest income 
in  lower interest rates reduced interest income by more than the decrease in interest expense because the company had more interest earning assets and because sharply lower treasury rates reduced the yields on loans and investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices 
in particular  the market prices of interest earning assets may be affected by changes in interest rates 
since net interest income the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is the company s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
in addition to directly impacting net interest income  changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings  the carrying value of investment securities classified as available for sale and the flow and mix of deposits 
the company s asset liability management committee  comprised of senior management and several directors  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee meets monthly and sets the rates paid on deposits  approves loan pricing and reviews investment transactions 
the company is subject to interest rate risk in the event that rates either increase or decrease 
in the event that interest rates increase  the value of net assets the liquidation value of stockholders equity would decline 
at december   it is estimated that an increase in interest rates of basis points for example  an increase in the prime rate from to would reduce the value of net assets by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to decrease  the value of net assets would increase 
although the value of net assets is subject to risk if interest rates rise but not if rates fall the opposite is true of the company s earnings 
if interest rates were to increase  net interest income would increase because the company has more interest earning assets than it has interest bearing liabilities and because much of this excess amount reprices within a short period of time 
as a result  net interest income is instead subject to the risk of a decline in rates 
not only are there fewer interest bearing liabilities to reprice  but many of these liabilities could not reprice much lower because the rates paid on them are already low 
accordingly  if interest rates were to decrease by basis points for example  a decrease in the prime rate from to it is estimated that net interest income would decrease by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to increase  net interest income would increase 
at december   it was estimated that the value of the net assets of the company would decline by  if interest rates were to increase by basis points and that the company s net interest income would decline by  if interest rates were to decline by basis points 
the year to year change in these estimates is a result of a shortening of the duration of the net assets of the company
