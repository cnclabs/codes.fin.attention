the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  investment balances and funds anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months primarily as a result of the divestiture of the individual 
com  inc business which lost million in certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
actual results could differ materially as a result of a variety of factors 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
management of growth and hiring of additional personnel the company has experienced growth in revenues and expansion of its operations which have placed significant demands on the company s management  development  sales and customer support staff 
continued growth will require the company to hire and retain more development  selling and customer support personnel 
the company has at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish its growth strategies 
continued difficulties with the recruiting and retention of personnel could adversely affect the company s ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion or to support satisfactorily its customers and operations  which could in turn  materially adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on factors such as demand for its services  changes in service mix  the size and timing of new and renewal subscriptions from corporate customers  advertising revenue levels  the effects of new service announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced versions of its services on a timely basis and the level of product and price competition 
a substantial portion of the company s cost of revenue  which consists principally of fees payable to information providers  communications costs and personnel expenses  is relatively fixed in nature 
the operating expense levels of the company are based  in significant part  on their expectations of future revenue 
if quarterly revenues are below management s expectations  results of operations would be adversely affected because a relatively small amount of the company s costs and expenses will vary with its revenues 
future operating results uncertain the company s ability to increase its revenues will depend upon its ability to expand its sales force  to increase sales to new customers as well as increase penetration into existing customers 
in addition  as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the time required for the company to reach profitability is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
as a result  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
although the company experienced growth in revenues in recent years  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will sustain revenue growth or be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
dependence on continued growth in use of the internet the company distributes certain services across multiple delivery platforms  including the internet  private networks based on lotus notes and other groupware products  electronic mail  and facsimile 
sales of certain of the company s services depend upon the adoption of the internet as a widely used medium for commerce and communication 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon 
as a result  there can be no assurance that communication or commerce over the internet will continue to develop at historical rates or that extensive content will continue to be provided over the internet 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  or timely development and commercialization of performance improvements 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it by such potential growth or that the performance or reliability of the web will not be adversely affected by this continued growth 
the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics of and quality of products or services 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the web and the company s online services 
if the necessary infrastructure or complementary services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition the business information services industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and entry into the field by extremely large and well capitalized companies 
the company competes or may compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies o large  well established news and information providers such as dow jones  lexis nexis  pearson  and thomson  o market data services companies such as adp  bloomberg and bridge  o traditional print media companies that are increasingly searching for opportunities for on line provision of news  including through the establishment of web sites on the internet  o large providers of lan based software systems such as lotus ibm and microsoft  which could  in the future  ally with competing news and information providers  and o to a lesser degree  consumer oriented  advertising subsidized web based services and internet access providers 
many of the market participants named above have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
increased competition  on the basis of price or otherwise  may require price reductions or increased spending on marketing or software development  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risks relating to acquisitions management may from time to time consider acquisitions of assets or businesses that it believes may enable the company to obtain complementary skills and capabilities  offer new services  expand its customer base or obtain other competitive advantages 
such acquisitions involve potential risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  technology  services and personnel  completing and integrating acquired in process technology  diverting management s resources  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new employees and customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
dependence on cooperative marketing arrangements the company has entered into certain cooperative marketing agreements and informal arrangements with software vendors  web site sponsors and operators of online services  including microsoft  netscape  yahoo and dow jones 
these companies presently market services that compete directly with those of the company 
if the company s marketing activities with such companies were terminated  reduced  curtailed  or otherwise modified  the company may not be able to replace or supplement such efforts alone or with others 
if these companies were to develop and market their own business information services or those of the company s competitors  the company s business and results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on news providers a significant percentage of the company s customers subscribe to services provided by one or more of press association inc  a subsidiary of the associated press  dow jones  the financial times and thompson 
the company s agreements with news providers are generally for terms of one to three years  with automatic renewal unless notice of termination is provided before the end of the term by either party 
these agreements may also be terminated by the provider if the company fails to fulfill its obligations under the agreement 
many of these news and information providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with the company 
termination of one or more significant news provider agreements would decrease the news and information which the company can offer its customers and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  an increase in the fees required to be paid by the company to its information providers would have an adverse effect on the company s gross margins and results of operations 
because the company licenses the informational content included in its services from third parties  the company s exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed content and generally obtains indemnification for any breach thereof  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that indemnification will adequately compensate the company for any breach 
dependence on news transmission sources the company s news and information for certain of the newsedge services is transmitted using one or more of four methods leased telephone lines  satellites  fm radio transmission or the internet 
none of these methods of news transmission is within the control of the company  and the loss or significant disruption of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
many newswire providers have established their own broadcast communications networks using one or more of these three vehicles 
in these cases  the company s role is to arrange communications between the news provider and the newsedge customer s server 
for sources which do not have their own broadcast communications capability  news and information is delivered to the company news consolidation facility  where it is reformatted for broadcast to newsedge servers and retransmitted to customers through one of two methods an arrangement between the company and wavo corporation  a common carrier communications vendor  or the company s own newsedge network  a proprietary entitlement and delivery system launched in the fall of that takes advantage of both leased line and internet delivery 
wavo presently also markets services that compete directly with those of the company 
wavo is also the communications provider for many newswires offered by the company through newsedge services 
the company s agreement with wavo expires on december  this agreement can be terminated earlier in the event of a material breach by the company of the agreement 
if the agreement with wavo were terminated on short notice  or if wavo were to encounter technical or financial difficulties adversely affecting its ability to continue to perform under the agreement or otherwise  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that if wavo were unable to fulfill its obligations  other sources of retransmission would be available to the company including newsedge network  although the transition from wavo to those sources could result in delays or interruptions of service that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
wavo did experience technical difficulties in may due to the disablement of the panamsat galaxy iv satellite 
this disablement caused an interruption in the delivery of news services to between one third and one half of the company s customers 
the interruption was resolved in approximately ten days and did not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
risk of system failure or inadequacy the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications systems in effective working order 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
similarly  the company s ability to track  measure  and report the delivery of advertisements on its web site depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
although the company has limited back up capability  this measure does not eliminate the significant risk to the company s operations from a natural disaster or system failure at its principal site 
in addition  any failure or delay in the timely transmission or receipt of news feeds and computer downloads from its information providers  due to system failure of the information providers  the public network or otherwise  could disrupt the company s operations 
the company s insurance policies may not adequately compensate for any losses that it may incur because of any failures in its system or interruptions in delivery content 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any event  damage or failure that interrupts or delays operations 
rapid technological change the business information services  software and communications industries are subject to rapid technological change  which may render existing services obsolete or require significant unanticipated investments in research and development 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its service offerings and keep pace with technological developments 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing services  to develop new services that address the needs of its customers and to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices  each on a timely basis 
services as complex as those offered by the company entail significant technical risks  often encounter development delays and may result in service failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
any such delays in development or failures that occur after commercial introduction of new or enhanced services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
proprietary rights and intellectual property the company is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights in its software and technology 
there can be no assurance that such measures are or will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies or services 
the company licensed the proprietary smart filtering software  which is used as the filtering engine within the company s news refinery  from cornell research foundation  inc cornell university 
under the terms of the license agreement with cornell university  the company had exclusive worldwide rights until february to design  develop  market  and sell systems and services based on the smart software for the retrieval and dissemination of data from recent and continually changing data sources 
provided that the company does not default on the license agreement  the company will retain a continuing worldwide  non exclusive  perpetual royalty free right to use the smart software  and in addition  the company owns  and will continue to own  all enhancements to the smart software that it has developed 
there can be no assurance  however  that cornell university has not or will not license the smart software to a third party  including a competitor of the company 
in addition  cornell university may terminate the license agreement if the company has materially breached the agreement and such breach remains uncured for days after written notice of such breach has been given 
if the license agreement for the smart technology were to terminate  there can be no assurance that a replacement solution could be developed or acquired  on a timely basis or at all  and on favorable terms to the company 
consequently  any termination of the company s license agreement with cornell university would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
there has been substantial litigation in the information services industry involving intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that it is not infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  inasmuch as the company licenses the informational content that is included in its services from third parties  its exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed informational content and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representations 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights of the company 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any such litigation would be costly and divert management s attention  either of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent the company from selling its services  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for heding activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
potential liability for information transmitted the company may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information it publishes through its services 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as print publications in the past 
the company s insurance may not adequately protect it against these claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   the company did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of us treasury notes  us government agencies and corporate bonds 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada 
the majority of company sales are denominated in us dollars 
the company has not determined what impact  if any  the introduction of the euro will have on its foreign exchange exposure 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the assets and liabilities of the company related to nondollar denominated currencies was not material
