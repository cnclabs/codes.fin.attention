item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the meridian resource corporation is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations primarily focused in the onshore and offshore south louisiana and southeast texas gulf coast region 
as an integral part of our business strategy  we take a very disciplined approach to each project and incorporate d seismic over every prospective area prior to our drilling of a first well 
we place emphasis on the research and development of every technological tool available and applicable to each prospect prior to commencing drilling 
as of december   meridian s reserves totaled bcfe  representing an increase of over year end  with a present value of future net cash flows before income taxes of million  an increase of million  or  over year end  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
our reserves are comprised of approximately natural gas with being proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves and have an average reserve life of years 
in addition to the proved reserves  meridian holds  net undeveloped acres   net developed acres  rights and licenses to over  square miles of d seismic data and access to over  miles of d seismic data 
we believe that we are in a strong position relative to others in our industry who compete in the south louisiana and southeast texas onshore transition zone region 
the difference is several fold and includes primarily our technical and professional staff and its experience in exploring for and producing oil and natural gas in our focus area at low relative costs  our large land and seismic inventories which form the foundation of the company s future prospects and growth  our method of approach to the development of original prospects and the understanding of what works best technically in our region  and our relationship with shell oil company shell as a shareholder and access to its technical research and entire d seismic inventory in south louisiana 
because of the shell acquisition and merger  we are now in a better position to balance the allocation of capital expenditures between our exploration activities and development exploitation activities  which provides us with greater flexibility during the volatile price environments we have experienced in the past 
the same holds true for calendar year and the projects currently scheduled for drilling 
management has set out and taken an aggressive three point plan designed to improve profitability and shareholder value  reduce debt and increase reserves and production levels 
the first step is the potential sale of approximately of the company s daily production 
chase securities has been retained to represent meridian in this process with bids due on april  the proceeds of the proposed sale would be primarily used to reduce the company s bank debt  which would result in lower interest costs  and would reduce lease operating expenses and general and administrative costs 
second  meridian is in discussions with shell regarding the stock rights and restrictions agreement to which the company and an affiliate of shell are parties 
this issue is being addressed by both meridian and shell to achieve the best results for ultimate shareholder value 
third  we have established a budget plan that  based on our reasonable expectations of product prices per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas  will provide meridian with an million capital budget for the year to further expose the company to high impact prospects 
key fields of interest which we will be focusing on this year include north turtle bayou ramos  weeks island  thornwell  turtle bayou and south timbalier block industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
in this regard  average worldwide oil and natural gas prices have increased substantially from levels existing during as a result of these increases  the average price received by us during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  these industry conditions  and any continuation thereof  will have several important consequences to us  including the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase its exploration and development program 
shell transactions 
on june   we acquired the lopi transaction louisiana onshore properties inc lopi  an indirect subsidiary of shell  pursuant to a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with lopi 
the consideration paid in the lopi transaction consisted of  shares of our common stock  
par value common stock  and a new issue of convertible preferred stock the preferred stock that is convertible into  shares of common stock  which together provided shell louisiana onshore properties inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell slopi  with beneficial ownership of of our common stock on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants and conversion of all preferred stock 
in a transaction separate from the lopi transaction  we also acquired on june  from shell western e p inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell swepi  various other oil and gas property interests located onshore in south louisiana for a total cash consideration of million the swepi acquisition 
the lopi transaction and the swepi acquisition together  the shell transactions were effected to substantially increase our reserves  lease acreage positions and exploration prospects in louisiana 
the shell transactions were accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  operations relating to the shell properties are included in our results of operations beginning with the third quarter of cairn merger 
on november   we consummated a merger the cairn merger with cairn energy usa  inc cairn 
in connection with the cairn merger  we issued approximately million shares of common stock 
we recorded a one time charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million for costs associated with the cairn merger 
ceiling test write down 
during  crude oil and natural gas prices were significantly improved over therefore  no write down of the value of our oil and natural gas properties was recorded 
a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices was the primary cause of our recognition of million of non cash write downs of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting during due to the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that future write downs will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
oil and natural gas revenues increased million as a result of increased volumes and improved prices 
the production increase was a direct result of the inclusion of results for the entire year from the louisiana properties purchased from shell as compared to their inclusion for only six months for  as well as new wells being placed on production during the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the additional operating expenses related to increased production and the inclusion of costs and expenses from the shell properties for the full year as well as new wells brought on production in the last twelve months  but reflects an actual decrease in operating costs to per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for this reduction was due to our efforts to reduce operating costs on all of our properties  especially those purchased from shell which had a higher cost of operations associated with them upon assuming control on june  severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in meridian s oil and natural gas is primarily produced from south louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to louisiana s severance tax 
louisiana s severance tax rates are per mcf for natural gas and of gross oil revenue 
our severance tax increase of million was largely tied to the increase of oil and natural gas production over and the fact that our average oil price increased over last year 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to the increased production in over levels 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increases in salaries  wages  other compensation and related employee costs associated with the increase in employees related to the shell properties acquisition and the development and exploitation opportunities associated with the properties and the d seismic surveys covering them 
in addition  because of increased oil and natural gas volumes and prices  the net profit interest distributions increased accordingly 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily a result of additional borrowings under the credit facility for the full year of versus only one half year for  and the issuance in june of million of convertible subordinated notes  due june  these additional funds were utilized in our capital expenditures program to further the exploration and development activities during a period when many in the industry were not as active in their drilling programs and drilling and service costs were lower 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
the million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased volumes  partially offset by lower prices for all products 
the increase in production was a direct result of the addition of the shell properties at june   as well as offshore platforms and new wells brought online in the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls  natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the additional operating expenses related to the inclusion of costs and expenses from the shell properties as well as new wells brought on production in operating expenses increased in to per mcfe from per mcfe for this increase was primarily attributable to the operating costs for the more mature fields acquired from shell being higher than those of our existing properties with higher per well flow rates 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is largely attributed to the additional production as a result of the purchase of the shell properties  which are located entirely onshore south louisiana and subject to louisiana s severance tax rates of per mcf for natural gas and of gross oil revenue 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to the increased production levels for over general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increases in salaries and wages and related employee costs associated with the increase in employees related to the shell and cairn acquisitions and the development and exploitation opportunities associated with the properties and the d seismic surveys covering them 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is a combination of increased borrowings of approximately million utilized to fund the purchase of certain properties in the shell transactions and continued borrowings to fund our capital expenditures program to further the exploration and development activities during  when many in the industry were not as active in their drilling programs and drilling and service costs were lower 
impairment of long lived assets 
as previously described  during we recorded write downs totaling million of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting due to significant decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices 
income tax expense 
we recognized a million deferred income tax benefit in associated with the reduction in the difference between book and income tax bases  principally due to the previously described oil and gas property write downs 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
during  our liquidity needs were met from cash from operations  additional borrowings under the credit facility and the proceeds of million from the convertible subordinated notes issued in june as of december   we had a cash balance of million and a working capital deficit of million 
the decrease in the cash balance and the increase in the working capital deficit from levels existing at december   primarily reflect the capital expenditures related to our continuing exploration and development activities 
credit facility 
we entered into an amended and restated credit facility with the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent the credit facility to provide for maximum borrowings  subject to borrowing base limitations  of up to million 
the borrowing base was reaffirmed on august   and is currently set at million  with a scheduled redetermination on march  in addition to regularly scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders under the credit facility have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time once during each calendar year and we have the right to obtain a redetermination by the banks of the borrowing base once during each calendar year 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by pledges of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries and a mortgage on all offshore oil and natural gas properties and several onshore oil and natural gas properties 
borrowings under the credit facility mature on may  the credit facility includes various restrictive covenants including an interest coverage ratio of to  a minimum net worth requirement of approximately million  and a total debt leverage ratio based upon total indebtedness to month trailing pro forma ebitda of to at december   and thereafter 
assuming that we continue to be successful in the development and exploration program during the next months  management believes that we will be able to comply with the credit facility covenants primarily due to the increase in production scheduled to begin in the near term at two of the most recent discoveries in addition to the positive effects of higher oil and natural gas prices  however  any declines in oil and natural gas commodity prices or unanticipated declines or delays in production may adversely affect the ability to comply with the credit facility covenants 
under the credit facility  as amended  we may secure either i an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  a certificate of deposit based rate or a federal funds based rate plus to or ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the credit facility also provides for commitment fees ranging from 
to 
per annum 
line of credit agreement 
we entered into a short term committed line of credit with chase manhattan bank for million which will expire on january  the interest rate is chase s prime rate plus  and interest payments are due on the last day of march  june  september and december 
it is renewable by mutual agreement of the parties 
the full amount of this line was available to be drawn at december   and million was available to be drawn at march convertible subordinated notes 
during june  we completed private placements of an aggregate of million of our convertible subordinated notes due june  the notes 
the notes are unsecured and contain customary events of default  but do not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis 
the notes are convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of our common stock  utilizing a conversion price of per share the conversion price 
the conversion price is subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
the holders of the notes have been granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock that are issued upon conversion of the notes or issuance of the warrants discussed below 
we may prepay the notes at any time without penalty or premium  however  if we redeem or prepay the notes on or before june   we will issue to the holders of the notes warrants to purchase that number of shares of common stock into which such notes would have been convertible on the date of prepayment 
the warrants will have exercise prices equal to the conversion price in effect on the date of issuance and will expire on june   regardless of the date such warrants are issued 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  and drilling and completion costs 
results were as follows net reserves from discoveries extension capital wells drilled oil gas expenditures gross net mbbls mmcf property acquisition expenditures  exploration expenditures    development expenditures  other capital expenditures  total    capital expenditures include amounts associated with prior  current and future years discoveries and extensions of our net reserves 
the capital expenditures budget for the year exploration and development program has been established at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the budget utilizing cash flow from operations and any availability under our line of credit 
we do not anticipate spending any additional capital other than that from cash flow for our exploration and development program 
we anticipate that any excess cash flow from operations as a result of increased rates or prices beyond the above million would be used to pay down our debt

s 
coast guard as a result of this incident 
we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage to substantially offset any economic losses and other damages arising out of these events  if any are proved to exist 
potential sale of properties 
in an effort to reduce bank debt and supplement internal cash flow to fund our inventory of exploration and development projects scheduled for drilling in and beyond  we announced on january   the initiation of a formal process to pursue the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the properties designated for sale account for approximately of our current net average daily production  or approximately mmcfe per day 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a buyer for such properties at a price that is acceptable to us 
dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
the preferred stock issued upon closing of the lopi transaction accrues an annual cash dividend of of its stated value with the dividend ceasing to accrue incrementally on one third of the shares of preferred stock on june   and so that no dividends will accrue on any shares of preferred stock after june  dividends on the preferred stock aggregating million were accrued for  of which million had been paid as of december  stock rights and restrictions agreement 
in light of the large ownership position issued to slopi in the lopi transaction and in recognition of both meridian s and slopi s desire that meridian functions as an independent oil and gas company  we entered into a stock rights and restrictions agreement with slopi that defines and limits our respective rights and obligations 
these agreements will limit slopi s and its affiliates control while protecting their interests in the context of certain extraordinary transactions by i allowing slopi to maintain representation on our board of directors  ii restricting slopi s and its affiliates ability to effect certain business combinations with us or to propose certain business combinations with us  iii restricting the ability of slopi and its affiliates to sell certain portions of their shares of common stock and preferred stock  subject to certain exceptions designed to permit them to sell those shares over time and to sell those shares in the event of certain business combinations involving us  iv limiting slopi s and its affiliates discretionary voting rights to of the total voting shares  except with respect to certain extraordinary events and in situations in which the price of the common stock for a period of time has been less than per share or we are in material breach of our obligations under the agreements governing the lopi transaction  v permitting slopi and its affiliates to purchase additional amounts of our securities in order to maintain a beneficial ownership interest in our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  vi extending certain statutory and corporate restrictions on business combinations applicable to slopi and its affiliates and vii obligating us  at our option  to either issue a currently indeterminable number of additional shares of common stock in the future or pay cash in satisfaction of a make whole provision contained in the stock rights and restrictions agreement in the event slopi ultimately receives less than approximately per share on the sale of any common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock 
slopi currently is restricted from selling shares of common stock owned by it until july  unless an earlier sale of shares is requested by shell  and approved by the meridian board of directors  shell can only sell shares of common stock under sec reg 
or by requesting meridian to permit the sale through one of eight registration rights granted to shell for the period of its holding 
beginning on july   slopi may sell of the common stock owned by it and may sell an incremental of the common stock owned by it each year until june   at which time it is free to sell any common stock owned by it 
slopi is prohibited from selling all of its common stock upon conversion of its preferred stock except as set out above 
we are currently in discussion with shell concerning terms and conditions of the stock rights and restrictions agreement 
however  in the event slopi decided to sell all of the common stock issued to it upon conversion of the preferred stock at market prices existing on december   the make whole provisions would be approximately million per year or a total of million after the four years 
meridian may satisfy this provision at its election in cash or common stock 
based on oil and natural gas prices effective december  and  assuming such oil and natural gas prices continue at or about those levels  we believe sufficient cash resources from operating activities will be generated during the year to pay any make whole obligations owed to shell in cash rather than issue common stock  and we believe it would make any such payments in cash assuming it is able to obtain the requisite waivers under the credit facility 
this obligation could significantly dilute all holders of our common stock other than shell  or significantly reduce our ability to raise additional funds for exploration and development 
year update in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to ensure that our systems are year compliant 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed less than  during in connection with remediating its systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  future capital expenditure plans  anticipated results from third party disputes and litigation  expectations regarding compliance with our credit facility  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following changes in the price of oil and natural gas 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the level of such production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors that it does not control  including seasonality  worldwide economic conditions  the condition of the united states economy particularly the manufacturing sector  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
material declines in the prices received for oil and natural gas could make the actual results differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
operating risks 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas  including uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  pollution and environmental hazards  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
in addition  we are subject to other operating and production risks such as title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices  limitations in the market for products  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against certain of these risks either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we cannot predict if or when any such risks could affect our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not adequately insured could cause our actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
drilling risks 
our decision to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis  production data and engineering studies  which are inherently imprecise 
therefore  we cannot assure you that all of our drilling activities will be successful or that we will not drill uneconomical wells 
the occurrence of unexpected drilling results could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
uncertainties in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to market risk from hedging contracts changes and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
hedging contracts meridian addresses market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
we enter into swaps and other derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
effective july   we entered into certain hedging contracts as summarized in the table below 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of meridian during the periods 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our current oil production 
the fair values of the hedge are based on the difference between the strike price and the new york mercantile exchange future prices for the applicable trading months of weighted average fair value at notional strike price december  amount per unit in thousands oil mbbls floor ceiling january june   interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility and the million principal of convertible subordinated notes due june  since borrowings under the credit facility float with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 
changes in interest rates would  assuming all other things being equal  cause the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate  such as the notes  to increase or decrease  and thus increase or decrease the amount required to refinance the debt 
the fair value of the notes is dependent on prevailing interest rates and our current stock price as it relates to the conversion price of per share of our common stock
