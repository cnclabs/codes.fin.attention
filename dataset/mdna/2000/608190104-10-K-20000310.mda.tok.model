seasonality the carpet business is seasonal  with the company s second  third and fourth quarters typically producing higher net sales and operating income 
by comparison  results for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to consumer residential spending patterns and higher installation levels during the spring and summer months 
certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of mohawk common stock 
a failure by mohawk to complete acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired operations could materially and adversely affect its business 
management intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses as part of its business and growth strategies 
although management regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities  it cannot offer assurance that it will be able to 
successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  
obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  
complete acquisitions  
integrate acquired operations into mohawk s existing operations  or 
profitably manage acquired businesses 
acquired operations may not achieve levels of sales  operating income or productivity comparable to those of mohawk s existing operations  or otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions may also involve a number of special risks  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on mohawk s business  results of operations and financial condition  including  among others 
possible adverse effects on mohawk s operating results  
diversion of mohawk management s attention and its resources  and 
dependence on retaining and training acquired key personnel 
the carpet industry is cyclical and a downturn in the overall economy could lesson the demand for mohawk s products and impair growth and profitability 
the carpet industry is cyclical and is influenced by a number of general economic factors 
prevailing interest rates  consumer confidence  spending for durable goods  disposable income  turnover in housing and the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries including the number of new housing starts and the level of new commercial construction all have an impact on mohawk s growth and profitability 
in addition  sales of mohawk s principal products are related to construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings 
any adverse cycle could lessen the overall demand for mohawk s products and could  in turn  impair mohawk s growth and profitability 
the carpet business is seasonal and this seasonality causes mohawk s results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
mohawk is a calendar year end company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
mohawk s second  third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income 
these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns and more carpet being installed in the spring and summer months 
mohawk s business is competitive and a failure by mohawk to compete effectively could have a material and adverse impact on mohawk s results of operations 
mohawk operates in a highly competitive industry 
mohawk and other manufacturers in the carpet industry compete on the basis of price  style  quality and service 
some of mohawk s competitors may have greater financial resources at their disposal 
mohawk has one competitor whose size could allow it certain manufacturing cost advantages compared to other industry participants 
if competitors substantially increase production and marketing of competing products  then mohawk might be required to lower its prices or spend more on product development  marketing and sales  which could adversely affect mohawk s profitability 
an increase in the cost of raw materials could negatively impact mohawk s profitability 
the cost of raw materials has a significant impact on the profitability of mohawk 
in particular  mohawk s business requires it to purchase large volumes of nylon fiber and polypropylene resin  which is used to manufacture fiber 
mohawk does not have any long term supply contracts for any of these products 
while mohawk generally attempts to match cost increases with price increases  large increases in the cost of such raw materials could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition if it is unable to pass these costs through to its customers 
mohawk may be responsible for environmental cleanup  which could negatively impact profitability 
various federal  state and local environmental laws govern the use of mohawk s facilities 
such laws govern 
discharges to air and water  
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste  and 
remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in mohawk s facilities and off site disposal locations 
mohawk s operations are also governed by the laws relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  establish asbestos and noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace 
mohawk has taken and will continue to take steps to comply with these laws 
based upon current available information  mohawk believes that complying with environmental and safety and health requirements will not require material capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
however  mohawk cannot provide assurance that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
future laws  ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition
