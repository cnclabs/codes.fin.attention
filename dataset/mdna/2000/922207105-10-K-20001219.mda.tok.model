item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal was the first full year as an independent entity for varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc  following the spin off from varian associates  inc vai in april until april   the company s business was operated as part of vai 
on april   vai contributed its semiconductor equipment business seb to the company  then distributed to the holders of record of vai common stock one share of common stock of the company for each share of vai common stock owned on march  the distribution 
at the same time  vai contributed its instruments business ib to varian  inc and distributed to the holders of record of vai common stock one share of common stock of ib for each share of vai common stock owned on march  vai retained its health care systems business and changed its name to varian medical systems  inc vms effective as of april  these transactions were accomplished under the terms of a distribution agreement by and among the company  vai and ib the distribution agreement 
for purposes of providing an orderly transition and to define certain ongoing relationships between and among the company  vms and ib after the distribution  the company  vms and ib also entered into certain other agreements which include an employee benefits allocation agreement  an intellectual property agreement  a tax sharing agreement and a transition services agreement collectively  the distribution related agreements 
the consolidated financial statements for periods ended on or before april  reflect seb as operated by vai 
the consolidated financial statements generally reflect the financial position  operating results and cash flows of seb as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented 
where it was practicable to identify specific vai corporate amounts with the seb activities  such amounts have been included in the accounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements also include allocations of certain vai corporate assets including pension assets  liabilities including profit sharing and pension benefits  and expenses including legal  accounting  employee benefits  insurance services  information technology services  treasury  and other vai corporate overhead to seb 
these amounts have been allocated to seb on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to or the benefit obtained by seb 
typical measures and activity indicators used for allocation purposes include headcount  sales revenue  and payroll expense 
the company believes that the methods used to allocate these amounts are reasonable 
however  these allocations are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been or that will be recorded by the company on a stand alone basis 
fiscal year the company s fiscal years reported are the or week periods which ended on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on october  fiscal year comprises the week period ended october  fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
the company s revenues of million in fiscal year increased by above the million in fiscal year due mainly to the increased demand for the semiconductor devices since the industry turnaround that began in the second half of fiscal year fourth quarter revenues in fiscal year included approximately million of non recurring royalty revenue primarily related to a licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
over the course of fiscal year  revenues increased steadily in each consecutive quarter  from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter  and to million in the fourth quarter 
royalty revenue for fiscal year was million compared with million in fiscal year  primarily due to the aforementioned licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
non us revenues in fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in the far east were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal sales to customers in europe were million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
gross profit on product and service revenue 
gross profit on product and service revenue excluding royalty revenue of million for fiscal year was of product and service revenues compared with million for fiscal year  representing of product and service revenues 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of its sales from fiscal year to fiscal year was due mainly to the improved capacity utilization and efficiencies in management of costs in a time of rapid expansion 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year research and development expenses were higher largely due to expansion of efforts in both product and services developments  reflected in the introduction of the viista series products for mm applications  including the new high energy viista research and development costs in fiscal included incremental costs incurred pursuant to the discontinuance of a parallel product development research contract  following the acquisition of the high energy ion implantation equipment product line of genus 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million  were of total revenue in fiscal year  compared to million  or of total revenue in fiscal year marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were higher as a percentage of revenues largely because of the additional administrative expenses in associated with the transition to operating as an independent company 
restructuring costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized pre tax restructuring charges of million  largely due to the downturn in the industry 
the charges included million resulting from the cancellation of plans for the expansion of manufacturing in the united states and japan  and million to cover termination costs for a reduction in workforce of employees approximately of worldwide vsea employment 
there were no restructuring costs in fiscal year see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and other income  net 
in fiscal year  the company recognized interest income of million compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recorded other income of million before tax  upon settlement of litigation 
after recording a payment to applied materials  and legal expenses  the company recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount and the estimated accrual upon settlement of their patent infringement and antitrust litigation  and in the second quarter the company recorded a gain of million upon receipt of a payment in settlement of a dispute relating to the acquisition of a product line which occurred in a prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  the company recorded other income of million relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount of a purchase price dispute relating to the sale of tfs and the estimated accrual 
earnings loss before taxes 
in fiscal year  the company had a pretax income of million  compared to a pretax loss of million in fiscal year taxes on earnings 
vsea s effective income tax rate was in fiscal year  compared to effective income tax benefit rate in fiscal year these rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax benefits arising from the use of a foreign sales corporation and tax credits and for fiscal year  unbenefited tax losses incurred prior to the distribution 
future tax rates may vary from the historic rates depending on the worldwide allocations of earnings and tax planning strategies 
net earnings 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year the company recorded net earnings of million compared with a net loss of million in fiscal year the net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year was compared with a net loss in fiscal year of per share 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
the company s revenues of million in fiscal year were below fiscal year revenues of million  due mainly to the effect of the semiconductor industry slowdown that began in the second half of fiscal year and continued through the first half of fiscal year fourth quarter revenues in fiscal year totaled million  up from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year included in fourth quarter revenues in fiscal year were approximately million of non recurring royalty revenue primarily related to a licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
over the course of fiscal year  revenues increased steadily in each consecutive quarter  from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter  and approximately million in the fourth quarter excluding the non recurring royalty income 
royalty revenue for fiscal year was million compared with million in fiscal year  primarily due to the aforementioned licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
non us revenues in fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in the far east were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal sales to customers in europe were million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
starting in the first half of fiscal year  the semiconductor industry began to experience a significant worldwide slowdown in equipment demand  brought about by depressed device pricing  excess capacity and the asian financial crisis 
the slowdown in product demand and extreme volatility in computer industry product pricing caused the semiconductor industry to reduce significantly or delay purchases of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and construction of new fabrication facilities 
this slowdown and volatility continued well into fiscal year these conditions adversely affected the company s results of operations for most of fiscal year gross profit on product and service revenue 
gross profit on product and service revenue excluding royalty revenue of million for fiscal year was of revenues compared with gross profit in fiscal year of million  representing of sales 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of its sales from fiscal year to fiscal year was partly attributable to costs associated with excess capacity  and costs related to increased staffing and training to respond to the increasing demand from customers 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million from the research and development expenditures of million in fiscal year research and development expenses were higher largely due to incremental costs incurred pursuant to the discontinuance of a parallel product development research contract  following the acquisition of the high energy ion implantation equipment product line of genus 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million were of revenue in fiscal year  compared to million  or of revenue  in fiscal year marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were higher largely because of the additional administrative expenses associated with the transition to operating as an independent company 
restructuring costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized pre tax restructuring charges of million  largely due to the downturn in the industry 
the charges included million resulting from the cancellation of plans for the expansion of manufacturing in the united states and japan  and million to cover termination costs for a reduction in workforce of employees approximately of worldwide vsea employment 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and other income  net 
in fiscal year  the company recognized interest income of million and recorded other income of million relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount of a purchase price dispute relating to the sale of tfs and the estimated accrual 
earnings loss before taxes 
in fiscal year  the company had a pretax loss of million  compared to million of earnings before taxes in fiscal year taxes on earnings 
vsea s effective income tax benefit rate was in fiscal year  compared to effective income tax expense rate in fiscal year these rates were lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax benefits arising from the use of a foreign sales corporation and tax credits and for fiscal year  unbenefited tax losses incurred prior to the distribution 
net earnings 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year  the company incurred a net loss of million compared with net earnings of million in fiscal year the net loss per share for fiscal year was compared with net earnings in fiscal year of per share 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  the company generated million of cash from operations  compared to consuming million in cash in operations in fiscal year  and cash provided by operations of million in the fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal year came primarily from net earnings of million  increases in accounts payable of million  warranty provisions of million  and from depreciation and amortization of million and tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and million in increased inventories  due to the substantial increase in sales 
the company consumed million in cash in fiscal year due primarily to increased accounts receivables of million  an increase in inventories of million and a net loss of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
in fiscal year cash provided by operations came primarily from net earnings of million  the reduction in accounts receivable of million and depreciation and amortization of million offset by increases in accrued expenses of million and accounts payable of million 
during fiscal year  the company used million for investing activities  mainly from the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  offset by disposals and restricted cash received 
in fiscal year  the company used million for investing activities due to a million decrease in restricted cash offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
in fiscal year  the company used million of cash to acquire the high energy ion implantation equipment product line of genus  inc  and million for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the company generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year  primarily due to the issuance of common stock 
in fiscal year  million of cash was generated from financing activities in fiscal year primarily due to the distribution of cash transfers from vai 
in fiscal year the company made cash transfers to vai of million 
the cash transfers of fiscal year and fiscal year reflect the former operations under vai 
vai historically used a centralized cash management system to finance its operations 
cash deposits from most of the businesses were transferred to vai on a daily basis  and vai funded its required disbursements 
as a result  the company reported no cash or cash equivalents at october  pursuant to the distribution agreement  as of april   the company received a cash contribution from vai such that vsea s cash and cash equivalents equaled million  restricted cash which totaled million and consolidated debt  which consisted of notes payable of million 
in may   the company closed on a million unsecured three year revolving credit facility  comprised of a million  day facility and a million  year facility 
the purpose of this facility is to provide funds for working capital and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or the sum of a percentage of certain eligible receivables and inventory  and bear interest at libor or a defined bank rate approximating prime  plus an applicable margin 
there are no borrowings currently outstanding 
the facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including maintaining a leverage ratio  fixed charge ratio and quick ratio within defined limits  capital expenditures within defined ranges  and maintaining profitable operations 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  the company s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with available cash of million at september   and the company s available borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future

certain factors that may affect future results this k report contains certain forward looking statements 
for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of  any statements using the terms believes  anticipates  expects  plans or similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this report and presented by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s operating results to differ are discussed below 
the company has a limited operating history as an independent company which may make it difficult to assess its financial performance and its ability to address the risks associated with its industry 
until april   varian associates  inc conducted the company s business as one of its divisions 
as a result  the company has only a limited operating history as an independent company on which its business and prospects can be evaluated 
the company s ability to satisfy its obligations and maintain profitability will depend on its future performance  and the company has limited experience in addressing various business challenges without the support of its corporate parent 
the company will not be able to rely on the capital resources and cash flow of vai and will need to generate its own revenues and secure sources of financing when necessary 
in addition  the company is a smaller and less diversified company than vai was prior to the distribution which may make the company more susceptible to economic downturns in the semiconductor industry 
if the company is unable to confront the challenges facing stand alone companies in its market  its business will suffer 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical  and a slowdown in demand for the company s semiconductor manufacturing equipment will negatively impact its financial results 
the semiconductor industry has been cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the industry experienced extreme volatility in product pricing and a slowdown in product demand during and if volatility and slowdowns occur in the future  the semiconductor industry may reduce significantly or delay purchases of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of new fabrication facilities which would harm the company s operating results 
even during prior periods in which the company s revenues declined  in order to remain competitive  the company continued to invest in research and development and maintained extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capability  which adversely affected its financial results 
if the upturn in the semiconductor industry is not maintained  the decrease in demand for the company s products could adversely affect its financial results 
the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor equipment industry 
significant competitive factors in semiconductor equipment manufacturing include the strength of customer relationships  pricing  technological performance and timing  distribution capabilities and financial viability 
the company believes that in order to remain competitive in this industry  it will need to devote significant financial resources to product and process research and development  to offering and marketing a broad range of products  and to maintaining and enhancing customer service and support centers worldwide 
the semiconductor equipment industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have resources to support customers worldwide  and some of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  service and support than the company does 
with fewer resources  the company may not be able to match product offerings or customer service and technical support of its competitors 
in addition  some smaller equipment manufacturers provide innovative technology which may have performance advantages over the company s systems 
if these manufacturers continue to improve their product performance and pricing or enter into strategic relationships with other large equipment manufacturers  sales of the company s products may suffer 
the company derives a substantial portion of its annual revenues from a small number of customers  and its business may be harmed by the loss of any one significant customer 
historically  the company has sold close to half of its systems in any particular period to its ten largest customers 
sales to its ten largest customers in fiscal years  and accounted for approximately  and of revenue  respectively 
during fiscal  no one customer accounted for or more of revenue 
during fiscal year  one customer accounted for and another for of revenue  and during fiscal  one customer accounted for of revenue 
although the composition of the group comprising the company s largest customers has varied from year to year  the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from a significant customer could adversely affect revenues 
the company expects that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company may have difficulty in attracting additional large customers because its sales depend  in large part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity in an existing fabrication facility or to transfer a manufacturing process to a new fabrication facility  both of which typically involve a significant capital commitment 
once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same supplier 
consequently  the company may experience difficulty in selling to a prospective customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s capital equipment 
the company s quarterly results of operations are likely to fluctuate  and as a result  the company may fail to meet the expectations of its investors and securities analysts  which may cause the price of its common stock to decline 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
from time to time  customers may reschedule or cancel shipments  or production difficulties could delay shipments 
a delay in shipments in any quarter due to these factors may cause revenues in such quarters to fall significantly below expectations  which could cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline 
the company s operating results also fluctuate based on gross profits realized on sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue may vary based on a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of products sold and costs to manufacture upgrades and customize systems 
in addition  a number of other factors could impact the company s quarterly operating results  including the following 
unexpected procurement or manufacturing difficulties  
pricing of key components  
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  
adverse weather conditions at its manufacturing facilities  and 
general conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels  and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s future business depends  in part  on its ability to successfully introduce and manage the transition to new products  and the company may not succeed in accomplishing these goals 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to develop  manufacture and successfully introduce new systems and product lines with improved capabilities and to continue enhancing existing products  in particular products that respond to the trend toward single wafer processing and mm wafer processing 
the company derives virtually all of its revenue from sales and servicing of ion implantation systems and related products and services 
if the company s next generation viista ion implant platform  which relies on single wafer processing  does not gain market acceptance  future operating results will suffer 
the company must accurately forecast the demand for new products while managing the transition from older products  or it may otherwise mismanage inventory levels 
in addition  the company may be unable to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of new systems or enhancements or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and on time  which may harm its reputation and business 
in the past  the company has experienced some delays in manufacturing and shipping systems and enhancements as well as problems with their reliability and quality 
if any of its new products have reliability or quality problems  it may incur additional warranty and service expenses  experience a decline in product orders or incur higher manufacturing costs to correct such problems  all of which could adversely affect financial results 
economic problems in asian markets could cause sales of the company s products to decline 
international sales accounted for  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  and specifically  sales to asia have accounted for a substantial portion of these revenues 
sales to asia accounted for  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
because the company relies on sales to customers in asia for a substantial portion of its revenues  its business is very likely to be adversely impacted by economic downturns and instability in this area 
in and  the company s business was harmed by banking and currency problems in some asian countries 
specifically  the decline in the value of the korean won  together with korean customers difficulties in obtaining credit resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of the company s korean customers 
this resulted in a cancellation or delay of orders for the company s products from korean customers which adversely affected operating results in and in fiscal year  the company recorded revenues of million in asia  compared with million in fiscal year  due mainly to increased demand for semiconductor devices 
the company s business in asia is affected by demand in each country 
if the recovery in japan s economy in is not sustained  economic conditions in other pacific rim countries such as taiwan may deteriorate or recovery may be delayed  and future sales of the company s equipment to asia may decline 
in addition  some of the company s products are assembled in korea  so the company is subject to risks associated with locating operations abroad  including currency exchange rate and transfer risks  restrictive measures by foreign governments and general economic and political destabilization 
if the company is unable to protect its proprietary rights adequately  it may lose its ability to compete effectively in the semiconductor equipment industry 
the company relies on obtaining and maintaining patent  copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes and obtaining key licenses because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process to market 
the company intends to continue to file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes 
however  the company cannot provide assurance of the following 
that patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by  or licensed to  the company  
that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology position against competitors  
that any issued patents owned by or licensed to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and 
that the rights granted under the company s patents will provide it with competitive advantages 
the company also has agreements with third parties for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
the company s loss of licensing agreements with applied materials and tokyo electron limited could have a material adverse effect on its business 
in addition  the company maintains and enforces its trademarks to increase customer recognition of its products 
if its trademarks are used by unauthorized third parties  its business may be harmed 
the company also relies on contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title  including confidentiality agreements with vendors  strategic partners  co developers  employees  consultants and other third parties to protect its proprietary rights 
if these contractual agreements are breached  the company may not have adequate remedies for any such breaches 
the company also cannot provide assurance that its trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by others 
patent claims may be expensive to pursue  defend or settle and may substantially divert the company s resources and the attention of management 
the company could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending patent suits brought against it or in asserting its patent rights against others 
if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to the company  its business may be harmed 
the company may not be aware of pending or issued patents held by third parties that relate to its products or technologies 
in the event that a claim is asserted against the company  it may need to acquire a license to or contest the validity of a competitor s patent 
the company cannot be certain that it could acquire such a license on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  or that it would prevail in such a proceeding 
from time to time  the company has received notices from and has issued notices to such third parties alleging infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights relating to its products 
if the company is subject to future claims of patent infringement  it may be required to make substantial settlement or damages payments and may have to devote substantial resources to reengineering its products 
it is difficult for the company to predict the quarter in which it will be recognizing revenue from large product orders 
during a quarter  the company customarily sells a relatively small number of ion implantation systems that typically sell for prices ranging from approximately million to million 
consequently  the company s revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted for a particular quarter if anticipated orders from even a few customers are not received in time to permit shipment during that quarter 
in addition  the company s product order backlog at the beginning of each quarter may not include all systems needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
because the company may build systems according to forecast  the absence of a significant backlog for an extended period of time could adversely affect operating results 
the company depends on limited groups of suppliers or single source suppliers  the loss of which could impair its ability to manufacture products and systems 
the company obtains some of its components and subassemblies included in its products from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases a single source supplier  including magnets and high voltage power supplies and accelerators 
the loss of any supplier  including any single source supplier  would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers and may also require devoting significant resources to product development to incorporate new parts from other sources into its products 
the need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause delays in delivery or significantly increase the company s costs 
although the company has limited insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources  the company cannot provide assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that it will remain available on commercially acceptable terms 
although the company seeks to reduce its dependence on these limited source suppliers  disruption or loss of these sources could negatively impact its business and damage customer relationships 
failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could subject the company to penalties and environmental remediation costs 
the company is subject to a variety of foreign  federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
these regulations include discharges into the soil  water and air and the generation  handling  storage and transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances 
these laws increase the costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of the company s operations 
vai has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  at eight sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal 
vai is also in various stages of environmental investigation and or remediation under the direction of  or in consultation with foreign  federal  state and local agencies at certain current or former vai facilities including facilities disposed of in connection with vai s sale of its electron devices business during fiscal year  and the sale of its tfs business during fiscal year 
expenditures by vms as successor to vai for environmental investigation and remediation amounted to million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
vms has accrued million in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilites as of september  the amount accrued has not been discounted to present value 
as to other sites and facilities  vms has gained sufficient knowledge to be able to better estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities 
vms has accrued million  which represents its best estimate of the future costs discounted at  net of inflation  to cover these costs 
this reserve is in addition to the million previously described 
the distribution agreement provides that each of vms  vsea and ib will indemnify the others for one third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs  as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs 
these accrued amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent may be greater than such estimates 
accordingly  the company may need to make additional payments to cover its indemnification obligations that would exceed current estimates 
in addition  the company s present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  such facilities have used substances which are or might be considered hazardous 
the company also may have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that the company cannot now predict 
if the company loses key employees or is unable to attract and retain key employees  it may be unable to pursue business opportunities 
the company s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of key managerial  technical and engineering personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the labor markets around the company s facilities in massachusetts 
the available pool of qualified candidates is limited  and the company may not be able to retain its key personnel or to attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly qualified engineers and technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the loss of these persons or the company s inability to hire  train or retrain qualified personnel could harm the company s business and results of operations 
the company s indemnification obligations under the distribution agreement could be substantial  and the company may not be fully indemnified in accordance with this agreement for the expenses it incurs 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  each of vms  ib and the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties and certain related persons from and after consummation of the distribution with respect to certain indebtedness  liabilities and obligations which could be significant 
the availability of such indemnities will depend upon the future financial strength of the companies 
there is a risk that one or more of these companies will not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations 
in addition  the distribution agreement generally provides that if a court prohibits a company from satisfying its indemnification obligations  then such obligations will be shared equally by the other companies 
the company has anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of its common stock 
provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  its by laws and delaware law could delay  defer or prevent an acquisition or change in control of the company or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock 
for example  the company s board of directors is classified into three classes  and stockholders do not have the right to call special meetings of stockholders 
the company s certificate of incorporation also permits its board to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition to delaying or preventing an acquisition  the issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
the company has also adopted a stockholders rights plan which may significantly dilute the equity interests of persons seeking to acquire control of the company without the approval of the board of directors 
the company does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the future 
the company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock 
the company s board of directors will have discretion to make decisions to pay dividends to common stockholders in the future which decision will depend on a number of factors  including results of operations  financial conditions and contractual restrictions  that the board  in its opinion  deems relevant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk as a multinational firm  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as the company s business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically  the company s primary exposures have resulted from non us dollar denominated sales and purchases in asia and europe 
the company hedges currency exposures that are associated with certain of its assets and liabilities denominated in various non us dollar denominated currencies and with anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the company does not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the company s forward exchange contracts generally range from one to two months in original maturity 
no forward exchange contract has an original maturity greater than one year 
forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  are summarized as follows notional contract value rate fair value foreign currency purchase contracts euro   british pound   japanese yen   korean won   new taiwan dollar   total foreign currency purchase contracts   foreign currency sell contracts japanese yen   new taiwan dollar   korean won   israeli shekel   total foreign currency sell contracts   total contracts   there were no significant unrealized gains or losses for these forward contracts as of september  the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of the company s exposure 
interest rate risk although payments under certain of the company s operating leases for facilities are tied to market indices  the company is not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with its operating leases
