item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our historical consolidated financial position at december  and  and results of operations and cash flows for each of the years ended december   and our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview our revenues  profitability and future growth rates will be substantially dependent upon our drilling success in the san juan and delaware basins  and prevailing prices for oil and gas  which are in turn dependent upon numerous factors that are beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been volatile  and oil and gas prices can be expected to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we may produce economically 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are capital intensive 
historically  our principal sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  a revolving line of credit and proceeds from sales of common and preferred stock 
our principal uses of capital have been for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties and related facilities 
during  our costs incurred in oil and gas producing activities were million 
our capital expenditure budget is million 
during  we drilled or recompleted a total of wells 
in  we plan to drill or recomplete approximately wells 
we expect to fund our capital requirements for the next months out of cash flow from operations and borrowings  as described below 
in september  we established a credit agreement with aquila energy capital corporation 
the initial amount available under the agreement was million 
at december   we had drawn million under the aquila agreement  of which million was used to retire the outstanding balance due under our line of credit with bank one  texas  na approximately million was used to pay transaction costs and million was used to pay outstanding accounts payable 
the amount available under the aquila agreement may be increased to as much as million as new reserves are added through our development drilling program 
our planned capital expenditures during anticipate that at least million will be available to us under this credit agreement 
we expect these additional funds to be made available as our drilling program proceeds 
principal payments on the four year loan began in november and are based on our cash flow from operations  as defined  less advances for our drilling program 
we do not anticipate making any principal payments for the next months because we expect drilling expenditures to equal or surpass defined cash flow from operations during that period 
the aquila facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
interest on the aquila facility accrues at prime plus and will be added to the loan balance 
the outstanding loan balance is due in full on september  as part of the transaction  we also entered into a four year agency agreement with aquila under which we pay a marketing fee equal to of the net proceeds from the sale of all of our oil and gas production 
in addition  we also issued to aquila  shares of common stock 
aquila also has a one time right to require us to purchase  of our common shares from aquila at per share during the day period beginning september  in september we also entered into a five year  million master rental contract with universal compression  inc to refinance our east blanco gas sweetening plant 
the proceeds from that financing were used to repay a term loan from bank one  texas  na that was secured by the plant 
the master rental contract bears interest at a imputed rate of 
payments under the master rental contract commenced in september we made principal payments totaling  to universal compression during during  prior to its retirement  we made principal payments of  on the bank one term loan 
in july  we negotiated an unsecured term loan for up to  with bank one  colorado  na to finance the purchase of land and a building for our field office 
we drew  on this loan during principal and interest at is payable quarterly beginning october  we repaid  and  of this loan during and  respectively 
in march  the due date of the loan was extended from july to april during fourth quarter  we realized net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay substantially all of our then outstanding long term bank debt 
under the mandatory redemption feature of our series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock we will be required to redeem  shares in april  and the remaining  shares in april the mandatory redemption price is per share  plus any accrued but unpaid dividends 
we plan to make the april redemption with available funds 
the series b stock is convertible to common stock automatically if the common stock trades at a price in excess of of the then applicable conversion price for each day in a period of consecutive trading days 
the conversion price is currently

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  the increase was due to higher oil and gas prices 
oil production for the year ended december  decreased to  barrels from  barrels for the year ended december  and gas production for the year ended december  decreased to  mcf from  mcf for the year ended december  production for was down from because our drilling and recompletion program was delayed pending the receipt of additional financing  which we received in september during fourth quarter  we drilled or recompleted wells with funds from the refinancing 
production decreases were offset by increases in average oil and gas prices realized in from those realized in average oil prices for the year ended december  increased to per barrel from per barrel for the year ended december  and average gas prices for the year ended december  increased to per mcf from per mcf for the year ended december  oil and gas production expenses 
oil and gas production expenses for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one time production tax credits 
production tax and marketing expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  lease operating expense per mcfe increased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  loe per mcfe in is higher primarily due to workovers 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to lower depletion expense 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december   due primarily to a lesser cost base resulting from the write down of oil and gas properties of million in fourth quarter  discussed below 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules of the sec  we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related tax effects 
application of these rules generally requires pricing future production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we made a non cash charge in fourth quarter to write down our us oil and gas properties by  in applying the ceiling test  we used december  oil and gas prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
we currently operate only in the continental united states 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to stock compensation expense of  recognized in fourth quarter related to the extension of the expiration date of certain warrants to purchase our common stock 
in addition  in fourth quarter of we expensed  of costs related to an equity offering which we did not consummate 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses nols for us federal income tax purposes in and  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our oil and gas producing activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our decision to provide a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we did not recognize any tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and at december   we had an nol carryforward for us federal income tax purposes of  which will begin to expire in extraordinary loss 
we incurred an extraordinary loss of  during the year ended december   as a result of the refinancing of our debt with a new lender 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
the net loss for the year ended december   includes  relating to a non cash write down of oil and gas properties discussed above 
we paid the dividend of  on  and  face amount series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and realized accretion of  in each year 
in  we issued  shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock  in conjunction with a refinancing 
the difference between the value of the shares at the redemption price of per share and the market value of the shares at the date of issuance will be accreted over a period of months 
during  we realized accretion of  related to these shares 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  the increase was due to higher oil and gas production due to our drilling and recompletion program in oil production for the year ended december  increased to  barrels from  barrels for the year ended december  and gas production for the year ended december  increased to  mcf from  mcf for the year ended december  these increases were somewhat offset by a decline in average oil and gas prices realized in from those realized in average oil prices for the year ended december  decreased to per barrel from per barrel for the year ended december  and average gas prices for the year ended december  decreased to per mcf from per mcf for the year ended december  oil and gas production expenses 
oil and gas production expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating costs related to new wells drilled in and expansion and operation of our gas sweetening plant 
production tax and marketing expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  lease operating expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  loe per mcfe in is lower due to higher average production rates per well for new wells and a higher proportion of gas production in  which is less costly to produce than oil 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to increased oil and gas production 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  decreased slightly to from for the year ended december   due to a higher ratio of reserve increases to capital expenditures in due to the impairment of oil and gas properties in fourth quarter  discussed below  the depletion rate per mcfe is expected to decline in future periods 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission  we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related tax effects 
application of these rules generally requires pricing future production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down if the ceiling is exceeded 
we recorded a non cash charge in fourth quarter to write down our oil and gas properties by  in applying the ceiling test  we used december  oil and gas prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the full cost ceiling is not intended to represent an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and gas properties 
it is possible that we may incur additional ceiling test write downs in the future 
the impairment amount of  in relates to additional charges that came in after we impaired the costs incurred in related to an exploration venture in belize  which drilled a dry hole 
we currently operate only in the continental united states 
impairment of mining properties 
in second quarter  we reduced our note receivable from laguna by  including accrued interest  in exchange for an overriding royalty interest in laguna s mineral properties 
due to continued depressed gold prices  in fourth quarter  we impaired this amount 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to the hiring of additional personnel because of expanded operations 
for the year ended december   we capitalized  more of general and administrative expenses directly related to our drilling program than was capitalized for the year ended december  interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit and term loans in equity in loss of affiliate 
as a result of reducing our ownership interest in laguna  for the years ended december  and  we accounted for our investment in laguna using the equity method of accounting 
our share of laguna s net loss was in excess of the carrying value of our investment in and advances to laguna by  our share of laguna s losses  up to the carrying amount of our investment in and advances to laguna  totaled  we will not reflect our share of laguna s future losses and may only reflect our share of laguna s future earnings to the extent that they exceed our share of laguna s and future net losses not recognized 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for us federal income tax purposes in and  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our oil and gas producing activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our decision to provide a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we did not recognize any tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and at december   we had an nol carryforward for us federal income tax purposes of  which will begin to expire in net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
of the net loss for the year ended december    relates to a non cash write down of oil and gas properties discussed above 
of the net loss for the year ended december    relates to laguna losses and impairments 
as discussed above  we will not reflect our share of laguna s losses in the future and may only reflect our share of laguna s future earnings to the extent that they exceed our share of laguna s and future losses not recognized 
we paid the dividend of  and  on our  and  face amount series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and realized accretion of  and  respectively 
beginning in april  preferred dividend payments were reduced as a result of the conversion into common stock and redemption of series b preferred stock  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued at the conversion price over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued at the conversion price  totaling  has been reflected on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as an increase to the net loss attributable to common shareholders 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  hedging activities we use hedging instruments to manage commodity price risks 
we have used energy swaps and other financial arrangements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
gains and losses on such transactions are matched to product sales and charged or credited to oil and gas sales when that product is sold 
management believes that the use of various hedging arrangements can be a prudent means of protecting our financial interests from the volatility of oil and gas prices 
under our credit agreement with aquila  we agreed to maintain price hedging arrangements in place with respect to up to of our oil and gas production upon terms satisfactory to us and aquila 
we recognized hedging losses gains of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  we terminated an energy swap entered into earlier in the year for production and received proceeds of  all of which is included in deferred revenue on our december  balance sheet and in oil and gas sales in our statement of operations 
year the following year statements constitute a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of year issues result from the inability of certain electronic hardware and software to accurately calculate  store or use a date subsequent to december  these dates can be erroneously interpreted in a number of ways  eg  the year could be interpreted as the year this inability could result in a system failure or miscalculations that could in turn cause operational disruptions 
these issues could affect not only information technology so called it systems such as computer systems used for accounting  land and engineering  but also systems that contain embedded chips 
we relied upon our internal staff to assess our year readiness 
the costs associated with assessing our year internal compliance and related systems modification  upgrading and testing were under  to date  we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operations due to year issues and do not anticipate any significant disruptions in the future 
miscellaneous our oil and gas operations are significantly affected by certain provisions of the internal revenue code that are applicable to the oil and gas industry 
current law permits our intangible drilling and development costs to be deducted currently  or capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
we  as an independent producer  are also entitled to a deduction for percentage depletion with respect to the first  barrels per day of domestic crude oil and or equivalent units of domestic natural gas produced if such percentage depletion exceeds cost depletion 
generally  this deduction is of gross income from an oil and gas property  without reference to the taxpayer s basis in the property 
the percentage depletion deduction may not exceed of the taxable income from a given property 
further  percentage depletion is limited in the aggregate to of our taxable income 
any depletion disallowed under the limitation  however  may be carried over indefinitely 
inflation has not historically had a material impact on our financial statements  and management does not believe that we will be materially more or less sensitive to the effects of inflation than other companies in the oil and gas industry 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we use commodity derivative financial instruments  including swaps  to reduce the effect of natural gas price volatility on a portion of our natural gas production 
commodity swap agreements are generally used to fix a price at the natural gas market location or to fix a price differential between the price of natural gas at henry hub and the price of gas at its market location 
settlements are based on the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified in the agreement 
the following table summarizes our derivative financial instrument position on our natural gas and crude oil production as of december  the fair value of these instruments reflected below is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to settle the contracts as of december  actual settlement of these instruments when they mature will differ from these estimates reflected in the table 
gains or losses realized from these instruments hedging our production are expected to be offset by changes in the actual sales price received by us for our natural gas and crude oil production 
see hedging activities above 
natural gas fixed price year mmbtu per mmbtu fair value crude oil fixed price year mmbtu per mmbtu fair value under our credit agreement with aquila  we are required to maintain price hedging arrangements in place with respect to up to of our oil and gas production 
accordingly  included above are agreements to hedge a total of  barrels of oil related to production for at fixed prices ranging from per barrel and to hedge a total of  mmbtu of gas related to production for at a fixed price of per mmbtu 
in addition  we entered into a basis swap to fix the differential between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is to be sold for  mmbtu for with a fair value of
