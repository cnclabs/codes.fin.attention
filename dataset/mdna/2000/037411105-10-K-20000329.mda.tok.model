item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview apache s considerable progress in and favorable outlook for continued growth were not fully reflected in the company s stock price at year end 
while wall street turned its attention to technology stocks  apache recorded its best year ever  paving the way for its rd consecutive year of production growth in performance highlights include record production of thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  up percent 
proved reserves of mmboe  up percent 
net cash provided by operating activities of million  up percent 
net income attributable to common stock of million  up million over our record 
more important than these milestones is the position they have left apache for continued progress ahead 
billion of capital expenditures brought into our fold quality assets with low operating costs and high margins 
the two acquisitions from shell coupled with first production from major development projects in egypt and australia contributed to a 
per boe decline in apache s lease operating expense per equivalent barrel produced 
record earnings coupled with million of equity offerings reduced apache s debt to percent of capitalization  among the strongest in our sector and capable of funding substantial growth opportunities 
rising production will generate substantial cash flow 
while prices are always a wildcard  should they approximate levels indicated by the current new york mercantile exchange  apache has the potential to achieve billion of cash flow in  adding fuel with which to act on opportunities that many of apache s competitors are unable to capture 
in short  despite only partial recognition in our stock price  apache s progress in puts the company in its strongest financial position ever to carry out its business strategy and continue to build lasting shareholder value

net financing costs for increased million  or percent  from primarily due to higher interest expense and lower interest income  partially offset by higher capitalized interest 
gross interest expense increased million resulting from higher average outstanding debt in the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt increased to percent at december  from percent at december  the increase in capitalized interest is associated with egyptian pipeline projects under construction 
the decrease in interest income was due to a lower average cash balance during net financing costs for decreased million  or two percent  from primarily due to higher capitalized interest 
gross interest expense increased million due to a slightly higher interest rate on average outstanding debt in compared to and higher imputed interest on advances from gas purchasers 
this was offset by an increase in capitalized interest  interest income and lower amortization of deferred loan costs 
the company s weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was percent at december  compared to percent at december  market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its united states and canadian natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
in  apache recognized a net loss of million from hedging activities that decreased oil and gas production revenues 
the net loss in includes million in derivatives losses and million in gains from fixed price physical gas contracts 
gains or losses on derivative contracts are expected to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical gas contracts 
at december  the company had open natural gas price swap positions with a positive fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would increase the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in prices would decrease the fair value by million 
the company also had open oil price swap positions at december  with a negative fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil prices would decrease the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in oil prices would increase the fair value by million 
discount rates used in arriving at fair values range from percent for to percent for at december   the company also had natural gas commodity collars with a fair value of 
million and oil commodity collars with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by 
million and million  respectively 
a percent decrease in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by million and million  respectively 
the model used to arrive at the fair values for the commodity collars is based on the black commodity pricing model 
changes in fair value  assuming percent price changes  assume non constant volatility with volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  notional volumes associated with the company s derivative contracts are shown in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately percent of the company s debt 
total debt at december   included million of floating rate debt 
as a result  apache s annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating rate approximately basis points would be approximately million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
australian gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in australian dollars 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date 
reported cash flow relating to canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
substantially all of the company s international transactions  outside of canada and australia  are denominated in us dollars 
the company s polish and australian subsidiaries have net financial assets that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries 
a decrease in value of percent in the australian dollar and polish zloty relative to the us dollar from the year end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately 
million  based on december  amounts 
the company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  cash flow  liquidity and capital resources capital commitments apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  payment of dividends  and capital obligations for affiliated ventures 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows 
apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows 
the company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow 
the company cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices

impact of the year issue the company has not experienced any year related computer failures or problems 
the cost to achieve year compliance did not exceed the estimated million 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves exploiting our existing asset base  acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value  and investing in high potential exploration prospects 
exploiting existing asset base we seek to maximize the value of our existing asset base by reducing operating costs per unit and increasing the amount of recoverable reserves 
in order to achieve these objectives  we rigorously pursue operations to cut costs  identify production enhancement initiatives such as workovers and recompletions  and divest marginal and non strategic properties 
acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value we seek to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers 
our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement  property consolidation and cash flow acceleration  facilitating asset growth and debt reduction 
investing in high potential exploration prospects we seek to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions 
we believe that these investments  although higher risk  offer the potential for significant reserve additions 
our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy 
they complement our north american operations  which are more development oriented 
a critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility 
we are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and credit position that gives us the foundation required to pursue our growth initiatives 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
