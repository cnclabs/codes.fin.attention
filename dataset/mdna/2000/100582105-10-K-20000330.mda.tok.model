item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in the growth was primarily attributable to a increase in the company s principal business  prepaid wireless services  and to a increase in teleservices revenues  primarily arising from increased customer service for carriers cc customers 
a decline in roaming service revenues and decline in systems revenues offset the growth in prepaid wireless services and teleservices 
in  total revenues increased compared to primarily due to increases in prepaid wireless services and teleservices revenues 
the company incurred operating losses for the years ended december    and totaling million  million  and million respectively 
excluding the effect of the one time charge for the reorganization of the systems division  the company generated operating income of  in the significant increase in prepaid revenues principally contributed to the improvement in operating income 
excluding the effects of the loss on impairment of long lived assets  the operating losses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increased loss in reflects the increased depreciation  telecommunication and personnel costs associated with the deployment and operation of the cc network 
the specifics of each division s revenues and net operating income loss are discussed in greater detail below 
the company s reportable operating segments consist of prepaid wireless services  teleservices  roaming services and systems divisions 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of the company s consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for the company s operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which the company s management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
the company evaluates performance based on stand alone divisions operating income loss before interest and taxes and allocates corporate level operating expenses to the operating divisions 
segment disclosure information is included in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its president and chief executive officer 
the company s divisions  or operating segments  are managed separately because each represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves unique markets within the wireless industry 
however  the divisions do complement each other in order to provide the company with a strong suite of products and services to meet the needs of wireless carriers 
the company s customers include eight of the ten largest domestic wireless carriers by subscriber  five of whom use three or more of the company s products

at the end of there were approximately million paid subscribers on the cc network  as compared to  subscribers at the end of  an increase of over 
the subscribers increased more than in from  at the end of the increase in was the result of new carrier contracts secured in  as well as existing carrier customers adding new markets to the cc network 
gross margins for the prepaid wireless services division improved from of prepaid wireless service revenues in to of revenues in and to of revenues in the improvement in both years resulted from the significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues in and that leveraged the predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
this increase in gross margins was partially offset by increased personnel and related costs incurred to support the growth of the cc network 
operating income loss for the prepaid wireless services division decreased from an million operating loss in to a million operating loss in  compared to operating income of million in although depreciation and other operating costs increased in to support the expanded system  the increases in revenues and gross margin in more than offset these costs  which are more fixed than variable  resulting in an operating profit 
the operating losses incurred in and were due to costs associated with developing and launching the cc network  including costs for personnel  network development and telecommunications equipment and software to launch and subsequently expand the cc system 
teleservices division teleservices division revenues increased from million in to million in and increased to million in the increases in teleservices revenues were primarily due to new and additional services provided to existing customers and the addition of new carrier customers in and a significant component of these increases was the increase in teleservices revenues from billing inquiry services provided to the prepaid division s carriers 
teleservices revenues from those services increased from million in to million in and increased to million in the company does not expect that these trends will continue for several reasons first  during the fourth quarter of  one of the company s carrier customers made the decision to transfer a portion of its customer care to an in house facility with existing capacity 
second  in order to maintain its competitive advantage for its prepaid system  the company has decided to offer its carrier customers the option to license the prepaid customer service software ccst  which will potentially have a negative impact on teleservices division revenues in  while providing additional licensing and maintenance revenue to prepaid wireless services 
the company s cc prepaid platform is attractive to carrier customers because billing inquiry can either be outsourced to bcgi or provided in house by the carrier 
gross margins for the teleservices division decreased from of teleservices revenues in to of revenues in  and declined to of revenues in the decreases in gross margins in and were primarily due to incremental costs in connection with opening one additional call center in and three centers in  including training  travel and other start up costs 
another reason for the gross margin decline was the leasing of call center facilities  equipment and personnel from third parties that began in august  that resulted in these costs being classified entirely in cost of services in and prior to  these costs were classified in depreciation or general and administrative expenses 
in october  the company cancelled the management services contract and acquired the underlying leases for the deland call center facility to achieve additional cost savings 
this buyout is expected to have a positive effect on gross margins given that a portion of the related expenses will again be classified as depreciation or general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the closing of the woburn  massachusetts call center is expected to reduce labor costs in operating income for the teleservices division decreased from  in to  in and  in operating income for the teleservices division represented of teleservices revenues in  in and in the decrease in operating income was due to costs associated with the closing of the woburn call center  including severance and asset writeoffs 
the decrease in was primarily due to the company s significant investment in call center technology designed to enhance service offerings as well as improve operational efficiency 
roaming services division roaming services revenues decreased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the decrease in roaming services revenues was primarily attributable to fewer suspensions of inter carrier automatic roaming agreements and some reduction of unregistered roaming use because of the growth of prepaid wireless services 
in addition  a consumer s decision to use the company s premium priced roaming service has been adversely affected by an increase in one rate registered roaming plans offered by some national carriers 
the company anticipates that these trends will continue and  therefore  roaming services revenues will continue to decrease over time 
gross margins for the roaming services division increased from of roaming services revenues in to in and declined to in the gross margin declined in due to lower revenues and therefore lower absorption of fixed costs  higher revenue sharing rates paid to the company s carrier customers and with increased roaming calls attempted that were not completed resulting in higher telecommunications costs 
the improvement in resulted primarily from enhancement and expansion of automated features of the service that reduced labor costs 
operating income for the roaming services division decreased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the decreases were primarily a result of lower absorption of fixed costs as roaming services revenues declined 
the decrease was partially offset by reduced labor costs and other cost reduction measures 
the company anticipates that operating income for the roaming services division will continue to decline due to the anticipated decrease in roaming services revenues 
systems division systems revenues increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the decrease in was due to a significant decline in orders for the division s international prepaid systems 
the increase in was due to system sales to new and existing customers in south america  including a sale to one customer for approximately million 
gross margins for the systems division decreased from of systems revenues in to in and decreased to of systems revenues in excluding the effects of the one time charge 
the decrease in was primarily due to the reduced sales levels for that absorbed fewer fixed costs 
in addition  the gross margin was further reduced by the one time charge of million recorded in the third quarter of for the reorganization of the systems division 
the charge principally relates to expenses associated with inventory write downs to bring the level of inventory in line with the future sales strategy  as well as severance costs 
the company believes that the reorganization will help position the division to expand its presence in the international market  while ensuring that corporate exposure to the under performance of the division is minimized 
however  should the reorganization not be successful  the systems division may incur additional operating losses  asset impairment charges or other write offs that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the decrease in was primarily a result of increased competition in the market for prepaid systems that resulted in reduced prices for the systems  as well as higher costs associated with installing systems abroad 
the trend of selling more prepaid systems in proportion to total systems sales also continued and  therefore  was an additional factor in the decrease in gross margin 
operating income for the systems division increased from  in to  in and decreased to a million operating loss in operating income for the systems division represented of systems revenues in  of systems revenues in and the operating loss represented of systems revenues in the decrease in was primarily a result of the one time charge along with the low sales volume that caused lower gross margins and less absorption of fixed operating  depreciation  and amortization costs 
operating income remained consistent as a percentage of systems revenues in and  notwithstanding the decrease in gross margin  because sales and marketing expenses of the systems division were reduced with the consolidation of one of the division s satellite sales offices into its tulsa headquarters 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk

engineering  research and development expenses remained consistent at for the years ended december  and  respectively  but increased from million to million due to additional personnel hired to develop new features and functionality for the company s cc network 
engineering  research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from to for the years ended december  and this decrease primarily resulted from engineers devoting less time to developing and building out the cc network infrastructure than they had in the prior year and  to a lesser extent  to the changes associated with organizing the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from engineering to general management and oversight of the divisions 
the company intends to continue to increase its engineering  research and development expenditures to support future development and enhancements of its prepaid and other wireless services and systems 
in addition  the company intends to invest additional resources to expand the capabilities of its current network to be positioned to take advantage of new wireless opportunities 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  advertising and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses remained consistent at for the years ended december  and  respectively  but increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in absolute dollars for primarily related to new marketing and business development efforts for the company 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in this decrease resulted primarily from revenues absorbing fixed sales and marketing costs that did not increase as rapidly as revenue growth 
in addition  the decrease resulted from the consolidation of the systems division satellite sales offices to the tulsa headquarters in and  to a lesser extent  to the changes associated with organizing the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from sales and marketing to general management and oversight of the divisions 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide administrative support to the company 
total general and administrative expenses were consistent as a percentage of total revenues for and at  respectively  but increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in  due to increased personnel and other related costs to support the company s growth 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the increase resulted principally from the addition of staff to support the company s growth and changes associated with organizing the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from marketing and engineering to general management and oversight of the divisions 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
goodwill related to acquisitions is amortized over eight years 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from to of total revenues for and  respectively  primarily due to the depreciation of additional technical equipment and software to support the rapid expansion and enhancement of the company s prepaid wireless network 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation as a percentage of teleservices revenues since most of the division s growth was facilitated through outsourced call center facilities 
in  the company primarily supported the growth in teleservices by leasing call center facilities  equipment and personnel from third parties and classified amounts entirely in cost of services 
depreciation and amortization expense increased more than in compared to the increase in was due primarily to the depreciation of additional technical equipment and software to support the rapid expansion and enhancement of the company s prepaid wireless network 
depreciation and amortization expense are expected to increase in due to increased capital expenditures for telecommunications systems  primarily related to new features and functionality and the continued expansion of the cc network 
in addition  the deland call center equipment leases assumed in october are expected to increase depreciation since these expenses will no longer be classified as cost of services but instead will be classified as depreciation expense 
impairment of long lived assets the company recognized a pre tax charge of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  for a write down of assets that are no longer being used to support the company s operations 
interest income interest income increased from million in the year ended december  to million in and decreased to  in interest income was earned from investments of the proceeds of the company s public offerings and was offset slightly by interest expense from the company s capital leases 
provision benefit for income taxes the income tax provision of  recorded for the year ended december  principally represents the company s assessment of the additional valuation allowance necessary on the company s net operating losses 
the income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  yielded a income tax benefit 
the lack of an income tax benefit in and the income tax benefit of  recorded in  resulted primarily from the non deductibility of goodwill from the company s acquisitions 
in addition  the company did not provide any additional benefit for net operating losses generated in the company s effective income tax rate may be greater than in future years due to the continued impact of non deductible goodwill 
the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that future results of operations will be sufficient to realize this asset

the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  seasonality  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  and general economic conditions 
in particular  prepaid wireless services revenues are affected by seasonal trends as the fourth quarter typically generates the highest number of net additions as compared to the other three quarters 
the timing of carrier contract renewals can also impact prepaid wireless service revenues 
teleservices revenues may be influenced by the requirements of one of more of the company s significant teleservices customers  including engagement of the company to implement or assist in implementing special projects of limited duration 
the company s roaming services revenues are affected by the frequency and volume of use of the company s services  which may be influenced by seasonal trends  as well as changes in demand during particular periods due to a higher or lower incidence of temporary suspension of inter carrier roaming agreements in certain markets 
the timing of orders and the number of large prepaid systems shipped during a particular quarter may fluctuate based upon the needs of systems customers and can have a significant impact on the level of systems division revenues 
because a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are committed in advance  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  unexpected revenue shortfalls could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of likely future performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million in to million in the increase was due to improved cash collections and cash management along with the use of capital leases to finance certain equipment purchases 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily generated from million in depreciation and amortization expense  which resulted from the significant investment in telecommunications systems and equipment in and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of million which primarily related to accrued call center management fees and cellular airtime 
the company s investing activities utilized million of net cash in the company expended million in  including almost million for telecommunications systems equipment and software for expansion of the company s cc network 
the company also purchased million in net short term investments 
the company anticipates that over the next months it will continue to make significant capital investments for additional equipment and enhanced feature capabilities to strengthen prepaid wireless services 
the company s financing activities utilized  in  mainly due to payments of capital lease obligations  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the company believes that its short term investments and the funds anticipated to be generated from operations would be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months 
impact of year many computer systems and software products installed in the industry were coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
in order to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  the date code field must be modified to distinguish between st and th century dates 
as a result  many companies upgraded or replaced their software and computer systems in order to comply with these year requirements 
the use of software and computer systems that are not year compliant could result in a system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of operations  including among other things a temporary in ability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
in total  the company expensed approximately  in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including without limitation  statements regarding teleservices revenue and gross margin  trend of decreased suspensions of inter carrier automatic roaming agreements  prepaid cannibalization of unregistered roaming and carrier marketing of one rate registered roaming plans to reduce roaming service revenues  roaming division profitability declining due to decreasing revenue  increased expenditures for engineering  research and development  greater costs of depreciation and amortization and an effective income tax rate greater than 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
a number of important factors exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  technological changes in the company s industry  the ability of the company to continue to successfully support its cc network  the ability of the company s carrier customers to successfully continue to market and sell cc prepaid wireless services  the company s ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  increased competition and general economic factors 
historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues in any particular period have been attributable to a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers can cause the company s revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the volume of call traffic generated through these customers  the services being performed for the teleservices programs and the level of system sales 
a significant decrease in business from any of the company s major customers  including a decrease in business due to factors outside of the company s control  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has recently developed a distributed architecture that will enable carriers to use our proprietary software to deliver prepaid billing inquiry in house 
however  any revenues generated from this application will reduce the need for the teleservices division to provide customer care services and therefore may reduce teleservices revenues in future quarters 
a number of the company s prepaid  teleservices and systems division contracts have been extended beyond their expiration dates or will expire in and beyond 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in renewing any of these contracts 
if these contracts are not renewed the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
also  when and if the contracts are renewed  many of the carrier customers have reached higher tiers of subscription levels and therefore contractual rates per minute will be lower than in previous years 
if subscriber levels begin to drop off  revenue could be adversely affected due to these lower rates 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify 
the company experienced an operating loss in and the first three quarters of  primarily due to expenses associated with the development and expansion of its cc network 
during the quarter ended september   an operating loss was also incurred due to the systems division one time charge  system outages in prepaid and a software problem in teleservices 
in addition  the company s systems division has experienced operating losses during each of the last six quarters due to fewer sales of international prepaid systems 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  variations in the level of system sales  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  the ability to identify  hire and retain qualified personnel and general economic conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
the company has recently taken steps in an attempt to improve the results of the systems division  which has generated losses during each of the last six quarters 
a reorganization plan was implemented in september in an effort realign the division and improve operating results 
however  should these reorganization efforts not be successful  the systems division may incur additional operating losses  asset impairment charges or other write offs that could materially and adversely affect the company s overall business  operating results and financial condition 
the company historically has provided its services almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
although the wireless telecommunications market has experienced significant growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that such growth will continue at similar rates  or at all  or that wireless carriers will continue to use the company s services 
the company expects that demand for its roaming services will continue to decline as fewer inter carrier roaming agreements are suspended  prepaid cannibalization of unregistered roaming use increases and carriers offer more one rate roaming plans 
in addition  prepaid wireless services are relatively new services in new markets  and if these markets do not grow as expected or if the carriers in these markets do not use the company s services  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future success depends  in large part  on the continued use of its existing services and systems  the acceptance of new services in the wireless industry and the company s ability to develop new services and systems or adapt existing services or systems to keep pace with changes in the wireless telephone industry 
further  a rapid shift away from the use of wireless in favor of other services  could affect demand for the company s service offerings and could require the company to develop modified or alternative service offerings to address the particular needs of the providers of such new services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or marketing its existing or future service offerings or systems in a timely manner  or at all 
the company is currently devoting significant resources toward the support and enhancement of its prepaid wireless services and systems to maintain system reliability and expand the cc network 
several of the company s carrier customer contracts contain penalty clauses that provide for reductions in revenue for certain network outages 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully support and enhance the cc network effectively to avoid system outages and any associated loss in revenue  that the market for the company s prepaid service will continue to develop  or that the company s cc network will successfully support current and future growth 
furthermore  the company has expended significant amounts of capital to support the cc agreements it has secured with its carrier customers 
because cc revenues are principally generated by prepaid subscriber minutes of use  the company s cc revenues can be impacted by the carrier s ability to successfully market and sell prepaid services 
revenues from the company s cc network are dependent on the ability to retain subscribers on the network and there can be no assurance that the company s churn rate percentage of total subscribers that terminate service on the network will not increase  which may result in reductions in related revenues 
teleservices revenues associated with billing inquiry support for cc carrier customers are becoming a more significant portion of teleservices revenues and therefore these revenues are dependent upon the size and growth of the cc subscriber base 
in addition  the company has enabled carrier customers to license software that enables cc customers to perform their billing inquiry in house if they choose 
this may reduce the company s teleservices revenues significantly and reduce profits accordingly 
the company has experienced outages on the cc network which have resulted in performance penalties and unbilled revenue 
despite efforts to avoid outages  there can be no assurance that future outages will not occur 
such outages can result in additional penalties and lost revenue for the company 
in addition  outages could damage the company s reputation 
the occurrence of one or more outages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has expanded its operations rapidly  creating significant demands on the company s administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
in addition  the growth of the company s teleservices division is dependent on recruiting  training and retaining employees to perform customer services responsibilities 
teleservices has also recently outsourced a small portion of its call center operations to a third party vendor who is responsible for certain operational functions  including hiring  training and retaining employees 
there can be no assurance that the vendor will continue to be able to meet the company s existing and future needs effectively 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors 
there can be no assurances that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by the company and its vendors 
if the hardware and software do not function as specified  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
the market for services to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
a number of companies currently offer one or more of the services offered by the company 
in addition  many wireless carriers are providing or can provide  in house  the services that the company offers 
in addition  the company anticipates continued growth and competition in the wireless carrier services industry and consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is exploring opportunities to utilize its prepaid network and real time rating engine for mobile and electronic commerce applications 
there can be no assurances that there will be a market for the company s network in the mobile and electronic commerce arena 
in addition  this market could be so highly competitive that the company will not be able to enter it 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology 
if unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s technology were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  some of the software used to support the company s services is licensed by the company from single vendors  which are small corporations 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to license this software to the company or  if any supplier terminates its agreement with the company  that the company will be able to develop or otherwise procure software from another supplier on a timely basis and at commercially acceptable prices 
the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer  switching and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
any damage  failure or delay that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset for net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that future results of operations will be sufficient to realize this asset 
however  there can be no assurances that future results of operations will be sufficient to fully realize this asset 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
the company does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
