item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements under this caption of this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
core materials actual results may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to business conditions in the plastics  transportation  recreation and consumer products industries  the general economy  competitive factors  the dependence on two major customers  the recent efforts of core materials to expand its customer base  new technologies  regulatory requirements  labor relations  the loss or inability to attract key personnel  ramp up of the company s south carolina facility  the availability of capital and management s decisions to pursue new products or businesses which involve additional cost risks or capital expenditures 
overview on december   core materials acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of international s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late based on the terms of the acquisition  the transaction for financial reporting and accounting purposes has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby columbus plastics is deemed to have acquired core materials 
however  core materials is the continuing legal entity 
core materials is a compounder and compression molder of sheet molding composites smc fiberglass reinforced plastic products 
core materials produces and sells  both smc compound and molded products for varied markets  including the automotive and trucking industries  recreational vehicles and commercial and industrial products 
core materials has two major customers  international and yamaha which account for approximately of the company s sales 
the demand for core materials products is affected by the volume of purchases from its customers  whose orders are primarily affected by economic conditions in the united states and canada 
core materials manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core materials operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  up from the  reported for sales to international remained steady at  compared to  in sales to yamaha increased in by to  compared with  in the increase in sales to yamaha is primarily due to additional product added in and an overall increase in demand from yamaha for core materials product 
sales to other customers increased to  from  in these additional sales were primarily the result of sales to new customers added in and including new holland north america  volvo trucks north america  inc  and caradon doors and window  peachtree division  gross margin was of sales in compared with for the decline in gross margin as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher production costs at both core materials columbus  ohio and gaffney  south carolina facilities 
in columbus  core materials experienced a shortage of plant labor  due to low unemployment in the columbus area  necessitating excessive overtime 
additionally  core materials incurred higher levels of scrap and labor inefficiencies as a result of the learning curve experienced by a higher than normal level of new hires 
the hiring of such new employees was necessitated by increased turnover  caused by the labor shortage and increased production for support of certain customer s inventory bank builds to allow for tooling refurbishment 
the columbus facility also experienced higher repair and maintenance downtime costs caused by two major machine breakdowns 
the maintenance downtime also resulted in lost production which exacerbated the overtime costs in order to catch up with customer delivery expectations 
in gaffney  core materials experienced higher usage of raw materials  increased scrap  labor inefficiencies and higher usage of supplies 
the increased costs in gaffney were primarily associated with the start up of new customer products and the general ramp up of production at this facility 
a significant portion of the new business noted above was produced in gaffney 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  up  or from  in approximately  of the increase related to non recurring items  including costs associated with the evaluation of additional facility locations  products and processes  the write off of costs associated with a potential acquisition that core materials decided not to pursue  and severance obligations and recruiting costs related to a reorganization of core materials management and salaried workforce 
the remaining increase of  which represents an increase of approximately over prior year  was primarily due to increased costs associated with obtaining additional personnel  increased travel associated with new customers  increased insurance costs  increased real estate and property taxes and other costs related to higher sales and an increased customer base 
interest expense for totaled  increasing from the  incurred in the increase in interest expense from was primarily the result of a full year effect of the interest costs on the  of industrial revenue bond borrowings incurred in may which were used to finance core materials facility in gaffney  south carolina 
in addition  an increase in interest costs on the secured note payable to international added to interest expense 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the increase in interest on the secured note was largely offset by a reduction in interest expense incurred on core materials line of credit 
income tax expense for was approximately of total earnings before taxes 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as core materials has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset  partially offset by a valuation allowance at december  as a part of the purchase accounting adjustments 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  core materials reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
actual cash taxes for are estimated to be a benefit of approximately 
net income for was  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share  representing a decrease of  or over the net income of  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share 
the decrease over s amounts was primarily the result of the production inefficiencies and the increases in sg a expense referred to above 
core materials has approximately  of operating tax loss carryforwards that do not begin to expire until the year the utilization of operating tax loss carryforwards and other timing differences for resulted in an increase in cash flow of approximately  since the company s estimated income tax payments were reduced 
the comparable reduction in income tax payments was  compared with net sales for totaled  up from the  reported for sales to international increased to  from  in the increase in sales to international was primarily the result of international s increased production of medium and heavy duty trucks 
sales to yamaha decreased in by to  compared with  in the slight decrease in sales to yamaha was primarily due to the maturing of the personal watercraft industry 
sales to other customers increased to  from  in these additional sales were primarily the result of sales to new customers added in including case corporation  outboard marine corporation  and caradon doors and window  peachtree division gross margin was of sales in compared with for the decline in gross margin as a percent of sales was primarily the result of unfavorable material usage variances  increased overtime costs  increased usage of production process supplies  changes in product mix  and startup costs at the gaffney  south carolina facility 
also impacting gross margin was the effect of increased lease expenses associated with a sale leaseback transaction 
as noted in note of the notes to financial statements  core materials sold various items of production equipment and leased the items back under operating lease agreements 
the proceeds of the sale were primarily used to pay down long term debt 
as a result of these transactions  core materials has recorded higher costs of sales  due to the lease payments exceeding the related depreciation for the sales leaseback equipment  offset by lower interest costs reflected below 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  increasing from  in the increase over the amounts was primarily due to the addition of a second plant in gaffney  south carolina 
this second plant provides additional capacity to support the production requirements of current customers and opportunity for growth 
the gaffney plant began molding and assembly operations in early interest expense for totaled  decreasing from the  incurred in the decrease in interest expense from was primarily the result of a reduction in interest costs on the secured note payable to international due to paydowns of principal on the note

the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by increased interest costs due to the  of industrial revenue bond borrowings used to finance core materials new facility in gaffney  south carolina 
income tax expense for was approximately of total earnings before taxes 
actual tax payments were substantially lower than the recorded expenses as core materials has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset  partially offset by a valuation allowance at december  as a part of the purchase accounting adjustments

per diluted share 
the increase over s amounts was primarily the result of increased sales as discussed above 
core materials had approximately  of operating tax loss carryforwards that did not begin to expire until the year the utilization of operating tax loss carryforwards and other timing differences for resulted in an increase in cash flow of approximately  since the company s estimated income tax payments were reduced 
the comparable net income would have increased by liquidity and capital resources core materials primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
these cash requirements have historically been met through a combination of cash flow from operations  equipment leasing  issuance of industrial revenue bonds and bank lines of credit 
cash provided by operations in totaled  net income contributed  with depreciation and amortization adding another  an increase in accounts payable contributed  this increase was primarily the result of increased purchases of material to support increased sales  capital spending and timing effects 
decreasing the operating cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable of  primarily caused by higher sales and slower collections and an increase in inventories of  which was primarily the result of higher production levels 
also decreasing cash flow was a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of  primarily caused by the lack of a profit sharing liability in investing activities reduced cash flows by  in capital expenditures totaled  which were primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
offsetting these expenditures were proceeds from the sale and leaseback of certain machinery and equipment of  and proceeds of maturities on the company s mortgage backed security investment of  financing activities reduced cash flows by  core materials borrowed  on the line of credit in order to temporarily fund operations and capital expenditures  all of the borrowed funds were repaid by year end principal repayment on the industrial revenue bond which was issued in also required a cash outflow of  at december   core materials had cash on hand of  of which  is restricted  and an available line of credit of  as of december   core materials was in violation of all three of its financial debt covenants for the line of credit and letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios 
core materials has received waivers for the covenants as of december  and a written commitment from the bank to waive these covenants each quarter through the quarter ended september  if core materials operates in compliance with financial projections for fiscal year and does not experience any material adverse change to its financial condition 
core materials has operated in compliance with the projections for the months of january and february and management expects core materials to meet the projections for the remainder of however  if performance should fall below these projections or if a material adverse change in the financial position of the company should occur  core materials liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
income taxes the balance sheet at december  and includes a deferred tax asset of  and  respectively  net of a valuation allowances of  in and of  in the decrease in the valuation allowance and a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax asset of  was due to the expiration of certain capital loss carryforwards in the valuation allowance was reduced from  in to  in based upon an extensive review of future taxable income 
this reduction was recorded as an increase in paid in capital in the equity section see note 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at december  primarily includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative net operating and capital tax losses of approximately  and  respectively  temporary differences between the book and tax basis of core materials property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  the valuation allowance at december  assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately  of the cumulative net operating losses and all of the cumulative capital tax losses will not be realized before their expiration date 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of approximately  of future taxable income from through taxable income for and was approximately  and  respectively 
extensive analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based upon the premise that core materials is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of core materials using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s long standing relationship with its two largest customers international and yamaha and core materials recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies  the maintenance of its relationships with yamaha and international and international s maintenance of significant market share  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects core materials by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
management believes that  because rates of inflation have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
year readiness statement core materials utilized internal and external sources to make the required modifications to both computer systems and internal operations related apparatus 
in addition  core materials worked with its suppliers and customers to aid in their becoming yk compliant 
as of the date of this filing  core materials has not experienced any material yk problems with its software  hardware and manufacturing of its products or with the operation of its business in general 
in addition  core materials has not experienced any material problems with any of its customers or suppliers 
core materials will continue to monitor its systems as unique dates within the year are encountered such as the first quarterly financial close 
the total cost of the year project was approximately  and was funded through operating cash flows in  and of the total project cost  approximately  was for the purchase and installation of new software hardware which was capitalized 
the remaining  which was expensed as incurred  did not have a material effect on the results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue eitf which pertains to pre production costs incurred by original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers related to the design and development of the parts they will supply to oems and costs to design and build molds  dies and other tools which will be used in manufacturing the parts 
companies must determine whether pre production costs meet the criteria in eitf to be capitalized or should be expensed as incurred 
the eitf is effective for design and development costs incurred after december  core materials has determined that the impact of this statement on its current pre production costs is not material 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments 
this standard requires recognition of all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
this statement additionally requires changes in the fair value of derivatives to be recorded each period in current earnings or comprehensive income depending on the intended use of the derivatives 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas  which amends sfas by deferring for one year the effective date of sfas  to those fiscal years beginning after june  core materials is currently assessing the impact of this statement on its results of operations and financial position and plans to implement statement no 
 january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core materials primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
core materials is also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core materials has the following three items that are sensitive to a change in interest rates long term debt consisting of an industrial revenue bond irb with a balance at december  of  interest is variable and is computed weekly 
the average interest rate charged for was and the maximum interest rate that may be charged at any time over the life of the irb is 
in order to minimize the effect of the interest rate fluctuation  core materials has entered an interest swap arrangement under which core materials pays a fixed rate of to a bank and receives of the day commercial paper rate  long term secured note payable with a balance as of december  of  at a fixed interest rate of  and mortgage backed security which matures in november such security is recorded at cost and is considered held to maturity as core materials has the intent and ability to hold such security to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates in both and  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would generally offset the impact
