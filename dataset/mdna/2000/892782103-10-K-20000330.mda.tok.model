the inability to utilize the san juan ramp structure necessitated alternative methods of discharging and re loading the two ro ro vessels 
instead of typical cargo operations of between and hours at the company s san juan terminal  the two ro ro vessels utilized other terminals where total cargo operations required between and hours 
while the ramp was out of service  the middle deck of the ro ro vessels remained inaccessible to trailers and could be used only for vehicles  which resulted in sub optimum utilization of one third of vessel space 
the additional time required to service the ro ro vessels in san juan resulted in schedule tightness that required most cargo operations to be performed during weekends where higher overtime rates applied 
this schedule tightness and the resultant uncertainty affected costs in addition to those directly related to san juan cargo operations  including trucking costs on the mainland
