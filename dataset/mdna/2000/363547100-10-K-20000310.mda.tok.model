item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview effective july   galileo international partnership merged into a wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of galileo international  inc the merger and effected an initial public offering of its common stock the offering 
references to the company  we  us and our mean  at all times prior to the time of the merger  galileo international partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries and  at all times thereafter  galileo international  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of this merger  i we became subject to us federal and state income taxes that were previously borne by the partners of galileo international partnership and ii we recorded a million nonrecurring charge to income tax expense to reflect the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising at the time of the merger 
upon the merger  the airline stockholders partnership interests were exchanged for our common stock in the same proportion as that of their respective partnership interests in galileo international partnership 
we generate most of our revenues from the provision of electronic global distribution services 
booking fees are the primary source of this revenue and are charged to travel vendors for reservations made through our system 
booking fees depend on several factors  including the type of reservation booked primarily air  car rental or hotel  the location of the booking and the level of travel vendor participation in our systems 
in addition to booking fees and related premiums paid by travel vendors  subscribers generally pay fees for hardware  software and certain services 
such fees are often discounted or waived for travel agency subscribers  depending upon the level of bookings generated by the travel agency 
in highly competitive markets  we often make incentive payments to travel agency subscribers that achieve defined productivity or booking volume growth objectives 
we also provide information services to airlines  including certain of our airline stockholders 
we currently provide fares quotation services  internal reservation services  other internal management services and software development services to such airlines 
our expenses consist primarily of local sales  marketing and customer service costs  commissions paid to national distribution companies ndcs  costs associated with the operation of our data centre and wages and benefits payable to our employees 
substantially all of our expenses are denominated and paid in us dollars  with the exception of operating expenses incurred outside of the united states 
cost of operations shown on our statements of income consist primarily of the costs of operating our data centre including wages and benefits of data centre and other technical services personnel  and hardware  software and communications costs and costs related to agency equipment including installation  maintenance and help desk functions 
commissions  selling and administrative expenses shown on our statements of income consist primarily of commissions payable to ndcs  incentives paid to subscribers and other costs of our selling and administrative functions 
our earnings can be significantly impacted by events that affect the travel industry 
such impact is typically caused by economic and other conditions that decrease the number of bookings made through our systems as a result of decreased demand for airline seats and other travel services 
other events  such as increased airline competition from low cost carriers  excess capacity or deterioration of an airline s financial condition  can often cause fare promotions within the airline industry 
this may result in an increased number of transactions and bookings for us  thereby stimulating our revenue earning capability 
we experience a seasonal pattern in our operating results  with the fourth quarter typically having the lowest total revenues and operating income due to early bookings by customers for holiday travel and due to a decrease in business travel during the holiday season 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial information 
during  we acquired three national distribution companies the ndc acquisitions apollo travel services partnership ats  traviswiss ag traviswiss and galileo nederland bv galileo nederland 
in connection with the ndc acquisitions  we recorded a nonrecurring charge to operating expenses of million million after tax related to the integration of the acquired ndcs 
this special charge consisted of million in severance related costs and million of other integration costs  principally related to duplicate facilities 
during  we acquired a florida based airline information systems company  s 
d 
shepherd systems  inc the shepherd systems acquisition and two national distribution companies galileo nordiska ab the nordiska acquisition and galileo canada distributions systems  inc galileo canada  the canada acquisition 
we also recorded a nonrecurring charge to operating expenses of million million after tax related to a strategic realignment of our operations in the united kingdom 
this special charge consisted of million in severance related costs and million in costs related to disposition of the current united kingdom facilities 
in connection with the ndc acquisitions in and the canada acquisition in  we have entered into agreements for the provision of certain marketing services the services agreements with the sellers or affiliates of such sellers of ats  traviswiss  galileo nederland and galileo canada whereby such sellers or such affiliates will provide services to us related to growing the respective business operations of the acquired ndcs 
during  we recorded a special charge of million million after tax related to the extinguishment of a portion of our liability to united air lines  inc united airlines under the provision of the ats services agreement  originally entered into in we transferred million in assets to a qualified special purpose entity  which has assumed the obligation to united airlines for a portion of the ats services agreement 
we also were successful in assigning our swindon uk facilities lease at market rates  resulting in recognition of an million million after tax recovery of previously reserved facilities expenses 
compared to revenues 
we generate our revenue from the provision of electronic global distribution services and information services 
during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue from electronic global distribution services and approximately of our revenue from information services 
the following table summarizes and revenues for electronic global distribution services by geographic location as a percentage of total revenues and summarizes total booking volumes for each of the years indicated percentage of revenue us market all other markets worldwide bookings in millions us market air car hotel leisure total bookings all other markets air passive booking adjustment japan adjusted air car hotel leisure total bookings total worldwide bookings the location of the travel agent making the booking determines the geographic region credited with the related revenues and bookings 
adjustment for the impact of a pricing structure change that reduced reported passive booking volumes in japan 
in markets outside of japan  the net impact to reported passive bookings due to the pricing structure change was slightly positive 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  our electronic global distribution services revenues grew million  or 
airline booking revenue increased over the year ended december  due to a booking fee price increase that went into effect in march  other yield improvements and a increase in worldwide air booking volumes 
international booking volumes increased and us booking volumes decreased for the year ended december  adjusting for the impact of a july pricing structure change that reduced reported passive booking volumes in japan  total international booking volumes increased for the year 
this increase in international booking volumes for the year was driven by strong growth in developing markets  such as africa and the middle east  and solid performance in europe and asia 
the volume decline in us bookings is primarily due to a decrease in our us market share  which we believe is principally attributable to the effect of our field sales force transition in with a new us sales force in place  we are aggressively executing growth plans for new and renewal business 
we remain confident in the ability of our new sales force to strengthen our position in the us market by the middle of the growth in electronic global distribution services revenues was partially offset by a decline in information services revenues due principally to the impact of providing fewer network services to an airline customer 
this revenue loss was largely offset by a reduction in operating expenses directly related to the provision of these services 
cost of operations 
cost of operations expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in cost of operations expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in voice communication charges related to the decrease in network services provided to an airline customer 
partially offsetting this decrease was million in additional cost of operations expenses incurred due to the galileo canada and shepherd systems acquisitions in these additional operating expenses  principally wages  maintenance and installation expenses  communication costs and depreciation expense  were largely offset by lower commissions as we no longer pay commissions to galileo canada but instead incur the direct costs of distributing our products in this market 
additionally  we now record the amortization of the excess of the cost of these acquisitions over the fair value of net assets acquired and also record the amortization of other intangibles acquired 
remaining cost of operations expenses increased slightly  primarily due to increased maintenance costs for subscriber equipment at agency locations and higher communication costs associated with the ongoing migration to new data network technology and growth in both new and existing markets 
these increases were substantially offset by net cost savings from the swindon  uk realignment and lower data centre expenses as we continue to take advantage of decreasing technology costs 
commissions  selling and administrative expenses 
commissions  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  ndc commissions and subscriber incentive payments increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in electronic global distribution services revenues resulted in increased commissions to ndcs  which were partially offset by the elimination of commissions to galileo canada as  subsequent to this acquisition in june  we no longer pay commissions but instead incur the direct costs of operating in this market 
ndc commissions are generally based on a percentage of booking revenues and have  therefore  grown at a rate consistent with the growth in booking fees by country 
incentive payments  which are provided to subscribers in order to maintain and expand our travel agency customer base  increased significantly in principally due to the initiation of new contracts with multinational and key us regional accounts in late and the first quarter of  as well as the impact of payments to subscribers previously incurred by galileo canada prior to june we expect that growth in subscriber incentives will continue in  but at a slower rate than we experienced in see statement regarding forward looking statements on page the remaining increase in commissions  selling  and adminstrative expenses was primarily attributable to million in favorable settlements during of contractual disputes from prior years 
this was partially offset by decreased selling expenses in the us as we transitioned to our internal sales force  decreased travel and effectively managed costs throughout the organization 
special charges 
we recorded a special charge of million related to the extinguishment of a portion of our liability arising from our services agreement with united airlines 
this services agreement was entered into at the time of our acquisition of ats in july under the agreement  united airlines agreed to provide us marketing and other support in the us and mexico 
in exchange for these services  we agreed to compensate united airlines if we achieved specific air segment growth and price increases over a five year period 
although we were accruing for the estimated liability under the services agreement in line with lower levels of historical and projected pricing  as a result of the price increase in the us and mexico that became effective on january   we now expect to owe the full price related obligation 
in december  we created and funded a qualified special purpose entity to provide for payment of this price related obligation to united airlines in july we transferred million in assets to this special purpose entity 
as a result  we have no further payment obligation to united airlines related to price increases under the services agreement 
during  we recorded special charges of million related to a strategic realignment of our operations in the united kingdom 
these special charges included severance provisions of million and million in costs related to disposition of the current united kingdom facilities 
during  we were successful in assigning the swindon  uk lease at market rates  resulting in the recovery of million of facilities expenses reserved in and a prior year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense net of interest income  foreign exchange gains or losses  and other non operating items 
other income  net increased million to million income for the year ended december  from million expense for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of million in gains realized from sales in secondary offerings of a portion of our equity in equant nv equant  and million in net gains on the unrealized appreciation in our technology investments 
these gains were partially offset by a million increase in net interest expense due to increased debt levels to fund repurchases of our common stock 
the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower foreign exchange gains 
income taxes 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of higher income before income taxes for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  partially offsetting this increase was the impact of a lower effective tax rate in as a result of successful tax planning  we reduced our effective tax rate by basis points to percent from percent in net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net income as a percentage of revenues increased to from over the same period 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  the revenues include the impact of the acquired ndcs whereas revenues  prior to the ndc acquisitions  represent galileo international partnership revenues 
assuming the ndc acquisitions occurred on january   see statement regarding forward looking statements on page revenues for the year ended december   on a pro forma basis  would have increased million million increase in electronic global distribution services and million increase in information services representing primarily revenue from subscribers for hardware  software and other services and revenue from airlines for information services performed 
comparing to pro forma  revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million in pro forma revenues for the year ended december  growth in versus pro forma electronic global distribution services revenues resulted primarily from an increase in airline booking volumes of and an increase in car  hotel and leisure booking volumes of during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total international booking volumes increased for the year  while us booking volumes declined over the same period last year 
reported us bookings declined due to a new fee structure we introduced in north america in march that only charges airline vendors for passive bookings that are ticketed 
we report only those bookings for which we receive a fee 
excluding passive airline bookings  growth in active bookings for the year was in the united states 
the increase in international booking volumes for the year was driven by strong growth in europe  the middle east  southeast asia and africa 
an air booking fee price increase that went into effect march  and other yield improvements also contributed to the revenue growth during the year 
cost of operations 
cost of operations expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  expenses include the impact of the ndc acquisitions as well as the impact of the canada acquisition and nordiska acquisition from the date of each acquisition 
expenses  prior to the ndc acquisitions  represent galileo international partnership expenses 
additionally  in conjunction with the ndc acquisitions  nordiska acquisition  canada acquisition and the shepherd systems acquisition  we record the amortization of the excess of the cost of these acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired and the amortization of other intangibles acquired 
assuming the ndc acquisitions occurred on january   pro forma cost of operations for the year ended december  would have increased million to million 
this increase is caused by additional operating expenses that were partially offset by lower commissions as we no longer pay commissions  but instead incur the direct costs of distributing our products in these markets 
the additional operating expenses represent principally the wages  maintenance  communication costs and depreciation of the acquired ndcs 
comparing to pro forma  cost of operations expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in pro forma expenses for the year ended december  as a result of the canada acquisition and nordiska acquisition  cost of operations expenses increased million as we incurred the direct costs of operating in these markets since the date of each acquisition 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to higher wages for technical personnel  increased communication costs due to market expansion and increased maintenance costs for subscriber equipment at agency locations  partially offset by a reduction in network services provided to an airline vendor 
subsequent to the ndc acquisitions  nordiska acquisition and canada acquisition  cost of operations expense growth was lower than revenue growth due to management s continued focus on operating efficiency and savings realized from the integration of the acquired ndcs 
during  we continued to take advantage of decreasing technology costs on data centre equipment and have negotiated favorable supplier contracts for subscriber equipment 
commissions  selling and administrative expenses 
commissions  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  ndc commissions and subscriber incentive payments decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in electronic global distribution services revenues resulted in increased commissions to ndcs which was more than offset by the elimination of commissions paid to the acquired ndcs as  subsequent to these acquisitions  we no longer pay commissions but instead incur the direct cost of operating in these markets 
ndc commissions are generally based on a percentage of booking revenues and have  therefore  grown at a rate consistent with the growth in booking fees by country 
incentive payments  which are provided to subscribers in order to maintain and expand our travel agency customer base  increased significantly in due to the initiation of new deals with multinational accounts  as well as the impact of payments to subscribers previously borne by the acquired ndcs 
remaining commissions  selling and administrative expenses increased primarily because expenses include the impact of the ndc acquisitions whereas expenses  prior to these acquisitions  represent galileo international partnership expenses 
in addition  the canada acquisition and nordiska acquisition  accruals for estimated payments under the services agreements and a new employee profit sharing program resulted in increased expenses  which were partially offset by million in favorable settlements of contractual disputes from prior years 
special charges 
we recorded special charges of million during the year ended december  related to a strategic realignment of our operations in the united kingdom 
special charges include severance provisions of million and million in costs related to disposition of the current united kingdom facilities 
we recorded special charges of million during the year ended december  related to the integration of the acquired ndcs into our operations 
special charges were comprised primarily of million in severance costs related to termination of employees and million of other integration costs  principally related to duplicate facilities 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense net of interest income  and foreign exchange gains or losses 
other income expense increased million  to million expense for the year ended december  from million expense for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of lower interest income arising from lower average cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes 
no provision for us federal and state income taxes was recorded prior to july  as such liability was the responsibility of the partners of galileo international partnership  rather than of the company 
as a result of the july  merger of galileo international partnership into a wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of galileo international  inc  we recorded initial deferred income taxes of million to reflect the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities in remaining income taxes for represent us federal and state income taxes subsequent to july  and income taxes for certain of our non us subsidiaries 
subsequent to the merger  our effective tax rate is approximately 
net income 
net income was million for the year ended december  net income was million for the year ended december  net income in reflects the recognition of us federal and state income taxes for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital totaled million at december  excluding million in debt outstanding under our day credit agreement  which was used to fund a portion of our repurchases of common stock for treasury  working capital totaled million at december  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital totaled million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million as we carefully monitor cash requirements and utilize excess cash to pay down outstanding debt and repurchase shares of our common stock 
cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to purchases of mainframe data processing and network equipment and purchases of computer equipment provided to our travel agency subscribers 
capital expenditures  excluding the capitalization of internally developed software  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in addition  we used million to acquire minority ownership equity positions in seven technology related companies during the year ended december  we received million in proceeds from sales in secondary offerings of a portion of our equity in equant during the year ended december  cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december   includes repurchases of common stock for treasury totaling million and dividends paid to our stockholders totaling million 
we also paid million to terminate two equipment leases related to swindon data center assets pursuant to advantageous early termination provisions allowed within the leases 
during the year ended december   net borrowings under our credit facilities totaled million and we have million available under our revolving credit facilities at december  we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  repayments of indebtedness  repurchases of our common stock for treasury  acquisitions of additional ndcs and other potential acquisitions that are aligned with our strategic direction 
we believe that cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our future cash requirements  except that significant acquisitions  investments  or share repurchases may require additional borrowings or other financing alternatives 
in connection with the ndc acquisitions and the canada acquisition  we entered into services agreements for the provision of certain marketing services with the sellers or affiliates of such sellers of ats  traviswiss  galileo nederland and galileo canada whereby such sellers or such affiliates will provide services to us related to growing the respective business operations of the acquired ndcs 
pursuant to the services agreements  we will be required to pay the sellers or such affiliates of the sellers of ats  traviswiss  galileo nederland and galileo canada fees of up to million reduced from million as a result of the qualified special purpose entity transaction in december see discussion below  million  million and million each on a present value basis as of the date of the agreements  respectively  in the sixth year eighth year for a portion of galileo canada following the acquisitions  contingent upon improvements in our airline booking fee revenue in the sellers respective territories over the five year period following each acquisition  as measured by the annual price increase rate and over the five year period seven year period in the case of galileo canada following each acquisition  as measured by the annual air segment growth rate 
in december  we created and transferred million in assets to a qualified special purpose entity to provide for payment to united airlines of the price increase portion of our liability under the ats services agreement 
this payment was funded by our cash flow from operations  sales of a portion of our equity in equant  and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
for the remainder of the ats services agreement and all other services agreements  we have reviewed and  to the extent deemed appropriate  established accruals for these payments based on an evaluation of the likelihood that the revenue goals required under the terms of these agreements will be met 
we do not expect to incur any liability related to the air segment growth component of the ats services agreement 
as of december  and  accruals totaling million and million  respectively  have been recorded and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to reinvesting a substantial portion of earnings in our business  we currently intend to pay regular quarterly dividends and to repurchase additional shares of our common stock 
the declaration and payment of future dividends  as well as the amount thereof  and the amount of future repurchases of our common stock beyond the existing million stock repurchase program are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any future dividends or repurchase additional shares of our common stock

effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements we will implement the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement  which is required to be adopted for financial statements issued for the fiscal year ending december  statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
management believes that adoption of statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
year the year issue was a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or systems or those of our vendors and suppliers that have date sensitive software could have recognized a date using as the year rather than beginning in september  we implemented a program designed to help ensure that all hardware and software used in connection with our business  including our software products  would manage and manipulate data involving the transition of dates from to without functional or data abnormality and without producing inaccurate results related to such dates 
an internal analysis of our hardware and software led us to conclude that the majority of our systems had been engineered to be year compliant and  indeed  provided a seamless transition to the year in addition  we consulted outside experts  including attorneys and independent auditors  regarding our year plans 
we electronically exchange information with the computer systems of our travel vendor customers and suppliers  including air  car  hotel  cruise  rail and other vendors 
we use standardized travel industry interchange formats to electronically exchange information with many of these vendor customers and suppliers 
many of these formats did not require modification in order to be year compliant 
where required  modifications to these formats were completed 
our globalfares system began successfully processing airline fares with year dates in july the investigation and assessment of our network systems was complete and remediation was finalized in october in the third quarter of  we completed remediation of our travel agency based software and distributed upgrades for operating systems and package installation systems 
the year remediation for most of our travel agency based software addressed aesthetic modifications and was not essential for the reservation booking and ticketing capability of these products 
remediation planning for country specific software solutions facilitating travel agency access to certain third party vendors is complete 
agency premise software remediation was completed in november remediation activities related to our mainframe computer systems  which include our galileo and apollo crss  were completed on schedule in our galileo and apollo systems successfully processed the first year airline reservation bookings on january  and february   respectively  with airlines that support year in their systems 
all non mainframe activities were completed in november embedded systems are not an integral component in our primary business or operations 
nevertheless  we identified and validated as compliant or  where necessary  remediated embedded systems in certain of our facilities and environmental systems 
we saw no material adverse impact to our business or operations related to year performance of embedded systems 
see statement regarding forward looking statements on page testing was a critical component in our year preparedness program 
our system for year hardware and software validation called the time machine was essentially a copy of our production environment which performed date sensitive tests and supported connectivity to the systems of our vendor customers  suppliers of data  ndcs and certain other third parties without interrupting existing systems and without risk of contaminating live production data 
contingency plans were in place for all mainframe and non mainframe activities 
our contingency plans identified the interruption of local services provided by third parties  such as telecommunication firms and power supply companies  as the events that would be most likely to occur 
our contingency planning involved risk assessment for all of our business functions and operating and staff departments  including the identification of assumptions and dependencies 
the contingency plans for each business function and operating and staff department provided for proactive preparation for year challenges  checklists of activities to perform for validation of possible failures and reactive planning to address any actual year failures 
the contingency plans also addressed on site staff coverage on january  for all relevant operating and staff departments  and included support personnel from our critical hardware and software suppliers 
as an electronic global distribution services company  our products are dependent upon data provided by our air  car  hotel and tour vendor customers and other suppliers of data 
we are also dependent on critical service providers  such as telecommunications firms for worldwide product distribution 
we worked closely with third parties  including our ndcs  to determine the extent to which our interface systems were vulnerable to failure by these parties to remediate their own year sensitive systems 
the interruption of services provided by critical service providers  such as telecommunications firms and power supply companies  due to their own year difficulties  could have had a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
with respect to bookings for travel after january   any failure on our part or on the part of our vendor customers  other suppliers of data or ndcs to ensure that systems are year compliant  regardless of when such bookings occur  could have had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we incurred million of expenses in  million of expenses in and million of expenses in related to year remediation 
all of these costs were expensed as incurred 
further  we believe future expenditures will total approximately million in to remediate and replace less critical software applications and embedded systems  however  we do not expect these expenses to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the cost of our year project and the dates on which we planned to complete our year modifications were based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  third parties year readiness and other factors 
new european currency in january  certain european countries introduced a new currency unit called the euro 
we planned  developed and successfully implemented a project to ensure that hardware and software systems operated or licensed in our business  including systems provided to our travel agency subscribers and our vendor customers  are designed to properly process reservations in the euro currency 
we completed the necessary development and successfully issued tickets in the new single currency on the first official trading day  january  we estimate that the introduction of the euro  including the total costs for the euro project  will not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see statement regarding forward looking statements on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of our expenses are subject to fluctuations in currency values and interest rates 
we address these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
to some degree  we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments  but management does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates related to the funding of our european and canadian operations 
at december   we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts that provide for purchases of gbp million  cad million  and eur million at various dates throughout at december   and  the notional principal amounts of outstanding forward contracts were million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of outstanding forward contracts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we are party to a million day credit agreement and a million five year credit agreement collectively  the credit agreements with a group of banks 
interest on the borrowings may be either base rate  cd rate or euro dollar rate based 
for the year ended december   the effective interest rate for loans outstanding under the credit agreements was 
if interest rates had averaged higher in  our interest expense would have hypothetically increased by million 
this amount was calculated by applying the hypothetical increase to the applicable interest rates and outstanding principal throughout the year 
we have also entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert portions of our variable rate debt to fixed rate 
we account for our interest rate swap agreements as a hedge of our interest rate exposure 
at december   and  we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million  million  and million  respectively  with fixed interest rates averaging   and  respectively 
the fair value of outstanding swap agreements at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we are also exposed to equity price risks on the marketable equity securities we hold for strategic purposes 
assuming a adverse change in the december  equity prices of our marketable securities  our financial position would not be materially affected
