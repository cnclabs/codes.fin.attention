the insurance industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years driven by the need for  and benefits from  economies of scale and scope in providing low cost insurance 
consolidation has involved both insurance brokerages  the company s primary customers  and insurance companies  and is directly impacting the manner in which insurance products are distributed 
management believes the insurance industry will continue to experience significant changes in the next several years to meet the changing distribution model 
changes in the insurance industry may create opportunities and challenges for the company 
management believes consolidation will force brokerages to decrease distribution costs and eliminate labor intensive tasks via automation 
competition will force brokerages to increase service levels via improved automated processes such as quoting and claims processing 
management believes that the company can partner with customers to provide integrated information management solutions  and fully leverage information technology and services 
the consolidation of the industry will create a marketplace of fewer yet more sophisticated brokers and agents 
in such an environment  the company could be subject to heightened effects of competition  particularly with respect to product functionality  service and price
