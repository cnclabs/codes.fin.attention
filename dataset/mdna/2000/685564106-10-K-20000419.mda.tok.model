item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings recent developments  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors  including those identified below in outlook issues and uncertainties  may affect our actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
our products and services are grouped into three business sectors space and ground infrastructure systems  satellite access products and satellite services 
space and ground infrastructure systems include launch vehicles and advanced programs  satellites and related space systems  electronics and sensor systems and transportation management systems  and satellite ground systems  space robotics  and mapping and land information services 
our satellite access products sector consists of satellite based navigation  positioning and communications products 
the satellite services sector includes satellite based mobile data communications services  satellite based remote imaging services  satellite based automotive information services and an investment in a development stage satellite based voice communications company 
this sector includes our share of the income or losses of our unconsolidated affiliates  orbcomm  orbimage  navigation solutions and cci 
we are accounting for our investments in orbcomm  orbimage and navigation solutions using the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognize as equity in earnings losses of affiliates our proportionate share of their profits and losses based on our percentage of common equity ownership or partnership interest 
we also recognize as equity in losses of affiliates our proportionate share of preferred dividends to other investors in such entities 
we also recognize of the revenues earned and costs incurred on sales of products and services to these entities 
however  as these companies are currently capitalizing all system construction costs  including amounts paid to orbital  we eliminate as equity in earnings losses of affiliates our share of profits from these sales based on our percentage of common equity ownership or partnership interest 
we are accounting for our investment in cci using a modified equity method of accounting whereby we recognize as equity in earnings losses of affiliates all of cci s losses even though we own less than of cci s common stock 
we do not recognize any revenues or related profits on sales of products and services to cci since we have provided substantially all cci s funding 
in the third quarter of  we wrote off our remaining investment in cci and  accordingly  have ceased recognizing any losses attributable to cci 
certain of the   and financial information has been restated 
see notes a and to the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments during the fourth quarter of  we recorded the following non recurring gains and charges gain on issuance of subsidiary stock 
in december  our wholly owned subsidiary  mda issued common stock to a group of minority investors  and immediately provided a dividend to us for the gross amount of the proceeds from the sale of  we recorded a gain on the issuance of such stock in the fourth quarter of approximately   net of taxes  fees and expenses 
asset impairments and write downs 
in december  we determined that the carrying value of a specialized voice communication satellite system would no longer be recoverable through the expected future sales of the related products or services 
in addition  a commercial airline navigation and communication system experienced cancellation of the sole customer sales contract in the fourth quarter of this cancellation reduced the probability of recovering the cost of the related capitalized software and inventory through future sales 
the total amount of asset impairment charges and write downs that we recognized in with respect to all assets  including our investment in cci  was approximately  and approximately  in the fourth quarter 
costs of proposed acquisition 
in  we and magellan entered into a merger agreement with lowrance electronics  inc  in which magellan was to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of lowrance 
this proposed transaction did not close and was terminated in december in connection with this and other transactions  we expensed  of transaction related costs 
orbcomm 
in january  we and teleglobe agreed to restructure the orbcomm partnerships and to realign our respective ongoing ownership interests for the purpose of governing and financing orbcomm s business  as follows teleglobe  through teleglobe mobile  is now the sole general partner with exclusive responsibility for managing orbcomm s business 
orbital remains a limited partner with limited protective rights and no future funding obligations 
orbcomm usa which was previously controlled and consolidated by us and orbcomm international which was previously controlled by teleglobe were contributed to and merged into orbcomm 
our ownership interest in orbcomm was reset at approximately on january   with further adjustment based on our and teleglobe s continuing capital contributions to orbcomm pursuant to a prescribed formula 
at march   orbital s ownership interest in orbcomm was approximately 
orbcomm agreed to settle all deferred invoicing under its satellite procurement contract with us  totaling approximately  at december  approximately  has been paid or otherwise settled  with the remainder due by june  we agreed to file an application with the fcc to transfer to orbcomm the licenses held by occ with respect to the orbcomm system if an aggregate amount of  in additional capital contributions or similar equity investments is made to orbcomm after january  results of operations for the years ended december   and as noted above  certain of the and financial information presented below has been restated 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for and  for consolidated revenues in  and included approximately   and  respectively  from sales to our noncontrolled and unconsolidated affiliates orbcomm  orbimage and navigation solutions 
space and ground infrastructure systems 
revenues from our space and ground infrastructure systems sector totaled  in  and  and  in and  respectively 
revenues from launch vehicles and advanced programs decreased to  in  as compared to revenues of  revenues in were  the decrease in  after a large increase from to and in spite of increasing firm backlog for government market satellite launches  is due primarily to customer induced launch schedule changes by our government customers and slowed demand from our commercial customers 
the increase in revenues from to related primarily to revenues generated on new pegasus and taurus contracts awarded in satellite and related space systems revenues increased to  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in satellite and related space systems revenues is due  in part  to revenues realized from a new commercial geosynchronous satellite contract received in late  offset  in part  by reduced revenues resulting from estimated contract cost increases experienced on certain satellite contracts in the fourth quarter of the increase in satellite revenues from to was primarily attributable to the july acquisition of the space and communications businesses of cta 
revenues from electronics and sensor systems and transportation management systems increased to  in  from  in revenues were  in the increase in revenues in was primarily due to new defense electronics contract awards in early as well as to an increase in transportation management systems revenues 
the increase in transportation management systems revenues is primarily attributable to our december acquisition of raytheon company s transportation management systems business 
the increase in revenues from to is due to delays experienced in in certain deliveries in our transportation management systems business 
revenues from our satellite ground systems  space robotics  mapping and land information services were  in  as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
as discussed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in may  we acquired the space robotics division of spar robotics 
the increase in is attributable to robotics revenues  which are now consolidated in our financial statements and were approximately  in the increase from to is primarily attributable to revenues recognized for a new remote imaging system and for international satellite ground systems and system upgrades 
in addition  through mda  in we began providing land information through business to business e commerce products and services after acquiring a database operating license from the province of british columbia 
our e commerce initiatives contributed approximately  in revenues in satellite access products 
revenues from sales of satellite based navigation  positioning and communications products increased slightly to  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in is largely due to increased shipments of consumer navigation products 
the increase from to is largely a result of our december acquisition of ashtech 
revenues attributable to ashtech products were  in and  in satellite services 
revenues for this sector totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues this year is primarily attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in rsi in the first quarter of our other businesses in this sector  such as orbcomm and orbimage  are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
gross margins gross profit margin depends on a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
costs of goods sold include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead related to sales of products and to costs incurred under various development and production contracts 
our consolidated gross profit for was  as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
consolidated gross profit margins as a percentage of revenues were approximately  and  respectively  for the three years ended december   and changes in gross margins are explained by business sector below 
space and ground infrastructure systems 
gross margins from our space and ground infrastructure systems sector were  or of sector revenues   or of sector revenues and  or of sector revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues and gross profits by major product lines within this sector were as follows revenues gross profit year ended december  year ended december  restated restated restated restated in thousands launch vehicles and advanced programs       satellites and related space systems       electronics and sensor systems and transportation management systems       satellite ground systems  space robotics  mapping and land information services       the significant decrease in gross profits for this sector during relates primarily to profit decreases resulting from estimated cost increases on certain satellite and advanced space launch vehicle contracts principally occurring in the fourth quarter of  a change in the mix of satellite products sold with an increasing contribution from lower margin geosynchronous satellites that contain a significant amount of lower margin  external subcontract effort beginning in late  the write down in of capitalized software costs and inventory relating to a commercial airline navigation and communication system  and lower margins for work performed on contracts acquired in the robotics acquisition in early gross margins in this sector were relatively level from to during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized contract costs of approximately  related to increases in estimates to complete certain space launch vehicle and satellite contracts 
gross margins for satellite ground systems  space robotics  mapping and land information services generally decreased throughout the period  primarily as a result of sales of lower margin land information e commerce products and services and an increase in the amount of lower margin  subcontract work on several ground systems contracts 
during and  the company recognized increases in gross margin of  and  respectively  related to the write off or expiration of certain canadian development loans no longer required or not expected to be repaid 
satellite access products 
gross profit margins for satellite access products were  or of sector revenues   or of sector revenues  and  or of sector revenues for  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins in is primarily due to increased inventory obsolescence charges taken in  offset in part by higher margins on precision products acquired from ashtech 
gross margins in this sector included only lower margin magellan consumer product sales in during and  our magellan subsidiary recognized approximately  and  respectively  of charges for inventory obsolescence relating to consumer navigation products 
satellite services 
this sector had gross margins losses of  or of sector revenues   or less than of sector revenues and  in  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross margins is primarily attributable to consolidation of rsi s operations in as discussed above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses represent orbital s self funded product development activities  and exclude direct customer funded development 
research and development expenses for  and were  or of revenues   or of revenues and  or of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses relate primarily to the development of new or improved satellite access products  improved launch vehicles and new satellite initiatives 
the significant increase in research and development in is primarily attributable to research and development spending in that year for satellite navigation products that were released in and transportation management systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of revenues   or of revenues and  or of revenues in  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized increases in allowances for receivables related to a certain satellite construction contract of approximately  the increase in the dollar amounts of selling  general and administrative expenses throughout the period is due to significant expansion of our business as a result of acquisitions of various product lines and businesses 
asset impairments and write downs in december  we determined that the carrying value of a specialized voice communication satellite system would no longer be recoverable through the expected future sales of the related products or services 
we recorded an asset impairment charge with respect to this asset in the amount of  in the fourth quarter of in addition  a commercial airline navigation and communication system experienced cancellation of the sole customer sales contract in the fourth quarter of this cancellation reduced the probability of recovering the cost of the related capitalized software and inventory through future sales 
the total carrying value of the software and inventory in the amount of  was recognized as a component of cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of gain on issuance of subsidiary stock in december  mda issued common stock in a private placement  and immediately provided a dividend to us of the  in gross proceeds  resulting in a one time gain of approximately   net of taxes  fees and expenses 
net investment income expense net investment income expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
investment income expense includes interest earnings on short term investments and realized gains and losses on investments  net of interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized  was  in and  and  in and  respectively 
capitalized interest was   and  in  and  respectively 
interest expense increased in primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding and because we stopped capitalizing interest on our investment in orbcomm as that affiliate began its planned commercial operations 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was  in and was  and  in and  respectively 
these amounts primarily include our proportionate share of the current period earnings and losses of our noncontrolled and unconsolidated affiliates orbcomm  orbimage  cci and navigation solutions  preferred dividends and beneficial conversion rights to other investors in orbimage and the elimination of our proportionate share of profits  when appropriate  on sales to these affiliates 
equity losses increased in and as compared to primarily due to an increase in orbcomm s and orbimage s losses 
orbcomm s losses increased due to i higher operating expenses relating to the rollout of global commercial services  ii increased interest expense  and iii increased system depreciation expense 
orbcomm stopped capitalizing interest and began depreciating its full satellite constellation in the fourth quarter of orbimage s losses also increased during the period as a result of the commencement of commercial services in and the subsequent increase in operating costs in anticipation of the planned introduction of new services in non controlling interests in earnings losses of consolidated subsidiaries non controlling interests in earnings losses of consolidated subsidiaries were   and  in  and  respectively 
these amounts represent the non controlling stockholders proportionate share of orbcomm usa s and magellan s and  beginning in december  mda s  current period earnings and losses 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of   and  in  and  respectively  primarily as a result of foreign taxes attributable to our canadian operations 
the tax provision included a one time charge of  related to the sale of mda s common stock 
the tax provision includes a deferred tax provision of approximately  relating to the orbimage preferred stock transaction in at december   we had provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately  valuation allowances are used to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
net loss our consolidated net loss in  and was   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our growth has required  and continues to require  substantial capital to fund investments in affiliates  business acquisitions  expanding working capital needs  new business initiatives  research and development and capital expenditures 
we have funded these requirements to date through cash generated by operations  working capital  loan facilities  asset based financings  joint venture arrangements and private and public equity and debt offerings of orbital and its subsidiaries 
our liquidity has been constrained primarily as a result of our inability to access capital markets pending completion of the restatement of our financial statements 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we agreed to a permanent reduction in the outstanding amount under our primary credit facility in the fourth quarter of and we cannot borrow additional funds under such facility 
we expect that our capital requirements for our operations for will be provided by cash from operations combined with cash on hand 
to satisfy our additional capital requirements  including potential investments in orbimage and required repayment of debt  management s plans include the possibility of raising additional equity and or debt capital  sales of certain assets and restructuring or refinancing of our credit facility 
management expects that such plans will generate sufficient additional liquidity to satisfy these required obligations 
we also expect to pursue certain additional investments and or acquisitions during such plans would likely require that we raise additional capital or otherwise generate sufficient capital by sale of certain assets 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in completing additional investments or acquisitions or new equity or debt financings or asset sales 
cash and investments were  and total debt obligations were  at december  the outstanding debt is comprised primarily of our  convertible subordinated notes due in  advances under several credit facilities  secured and unsecured notes  and asset based financings 
cash and investments at december  included approximately  restricted to support bank covenants and outstanding letters of credit 
our current ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
our ratio of total debt less cash and investments to total debt plus total stockholders equity was approximately at december  as compared to at december  our primary credit facility provides for total borrowings from an international syndicate of banks of up to  all of which was drawn and outstanding as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of 
these borrowings are collateralized by accounts receivable  intellectual property and certain other assets  including the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries and mda 
the facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends  contains certain covenants with respect to our working capital levels  fixed charges ratio  leverage ratio and net worth  and expires in december we amended this facility several times in to waive noncompliance with certain financial covenants and to amend other covenants including with respect to net worth  leverage and fixed charges 
we also permanently reduced the total amount available under the facility from an original  to the current level of  in april  we signed an amendment that waived noncompliance with certain covenants for all periods prior to the amendment date  and established new covenant levels for for net worth  leverage including senior leverage  fixed charges  capital expenditures  and subsidiary debt 
we also agreed with our banks to further reduce the total amount that is available under the facility on august  by either i an additional  if we and the banks restructure the facility by may  or ii by an additional  if we are unsuccessful in restructuring the facility by that date 
we are required to apply toward this reduction of the net cash proceeds that we receive from any equity offering  asset sale or debt issuance by us or our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  we agreed to further reduce the facility to  by july we issued  of new debt in related to various business acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also issued additional equity at mda for net proceeds of  during  we provided  in capital to orbcomm 
based on our january agreement with teleglobe  we are no longer obligated to provide additional capital to orbcomm 
see recent developments 
orbcomm will require additional funding in  and we understand that orbcomm and teleglobe are currently analyzing different capital raising and funding alternatives  including continued capital contributions from teleglobe and or obtaining additional equity participants 
in addition to our investment in orbcomm  in we invested approximately  in navigation solutions   in business and other asset acquisitions and  in capital expenditures for various satellite  launch vehicle and other infrastructure production  manufacturing and test equipment  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
our operations provided net cash of approximately  during finally  we had a contingent commitment to provide additional equity financing to orbimage in the amount of up to  which amount was reduced in march to  based on orbimage s cash requirements 
in addition to our committed amount  orbimage will require additional funding in and is currently analyzing different capital raising and funding alternatives  including drawing on orbital s contingent commitment and or obtaining additional equity and debt capital 
we are expanding our offices and satellite related engineering  manufacturing and operations facilities adjacent to our northern virginia corporate headquarters in order to consolidate certain operational facilities and office space and provide for future growth 
construction has commenced and is expected to continue into to finance the majority of this expansion  we have negotiated a built to suit agreement with a developer for the office expansion 
we are actively pursuing third party financing for the engineering  manufacturing and operating facilities 
outlook issues and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor  in certain circumstances  for certain forward looking statements made by or on behalf of orbital 
orbital and its representatives may from time to time make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the report to stockholders 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to our sales and earnings growth  statements expressing general optimism about future operating results  statements relating to our liquidity and future financing plans and statements relating to our belief about the outcome of pending litigation are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are and will be based on management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from information contained in our forward looking statements most of the products we and our affiliates develop and manufacture are technologically advanced and sometimes novel systems that must function under demanding operating conditions and are subject to significant technological change and innovation 
we have experienced product failures or other operational problems 
in addition to any costs resulting from product warranties or required remedial action  product failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues due to postponement or cancellation of subsequently scheduled operations or product deliveries 
our financial performance generally  as well as the recoverability of our investments in orbcomm and orbimage and any other company in which we make a strategic investment  and investments that we make in the development of new technologies for new products or existing product enhancements  depend on several factors including  among other things  the successful and timely funding and implementation of innovative and novel technologies involving complex systems in a cost effective manner  the establishment and expansion of commercial markets and customer acceptance  competition and such entities ability to raise necessary capital 
if we conclude at any time that our investments are not recoverable  we may be required to write off part or all of such investments 
in  we wrote off our investment in cci 
historically  we have made strategic acquisitions of businesses  and we routinely evaluate potential acquisition candidates that we believe would enhance our business 
we have also historically pursued strategic alliances through joint ventures  and we routinely evaluate similar opportunities 
such transactions commonly involve certain risks including  among others  assimilating the acquired operations  technologies and personnel and maintaining appropriate standards  controls  procedures and policies  entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  potential exposure to claims and liabilities relating to the acquired company  potentially losing key employees of acquired organizations  the diversion of management attention from other ongoing business concerns and resolving potential disputes with joint venture partners and or other investors 
we have recently entered into certain transactions in which we have reduced our ability to control the management and operations of certain subsidiaries and affiliates 
our diminished ability to control such entities could result in financial or operating decisions regarding such entities being made that are contrary to orbital s interests 
our growth has required  and continues to require  substantial capital to fund investments in affiliates  business acquisitions  expanding working capital needs  new business initiatives  research and development and capital expenditures 
recently  our liquidity has been constrained primarily as a result of our inability to raise capital due to the pending completion of the restatement of our financial statements 
in addition  we agreed to a permanent reduction in the outstanding amount under our primary credit facility in the fourth quarter of  and we cannot borrow additional funds under such facility 
to satisfy our capital requirements beyond our operations  including required repayments under the credit facility  we will need to raise additional equity and or debt capital and we are considering sales of non core assets 
our inability to raise additional capital or to restructure our credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our business 
at december   approximately of our total firm contract backlog was derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with prime contractors to the us government 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause 
such contract suspensions or terminations could result in unreimbursable expenses or charges or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the accuracy and appropriateness of our direct and indirect costs and expenses under our contracts with the us government are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency or by other appropriate agencies of the us government 
these agencies have the right to challenge our cost estimates or allocations with respect to any such contract 
a substantial portion of payments to us under us government contracts are provisional payments that are subject to potential adjustment upon audit by such agencies 
the majority of our contracts  particularly for our space and ground infrastructure systems  are long term contracts 
we recognize revenues on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue  and therefore profit  is recognized based on actual costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs to complete the contract or based on specific delivery terms and conditions 
revenue recognition and profitability  if any  from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that original cost estimates  estimated costs to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
the costs and other effects of pending or possible litigation or governmental investigations could have an adverse effect on our business and could divert the attention of management from ongoing business matters 
virtually all our products and services face significant competition from existing competitors  many of whom are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
furthermore  the possibility exists that other domestic or foreign companies or governments will seek to produce products or services that compete with our products or services 
a foreign competitor could benefit from subsidies from  or other protective measures by  its home country 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material exposure to interest rate changes  commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuation  or similar market risks  although we do enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against specific foreign currency fluctuations  principally with respect to the canadian dollar and japanese yen 
at december   the majority of the company s long term debt consisted of its  convertible subordinated notes due the fair market value of these convertible securities fluctuates with the company s stock price  and was  at december  the company enters into forward exchange contracts in an effort to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  orbital is subject to off balance sheet market risk for the possibility that future changes in market prices may make the forward exchange contracts less valuable
