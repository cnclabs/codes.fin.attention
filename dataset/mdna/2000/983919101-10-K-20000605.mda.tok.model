our products have provided effective solutions for a wide range of customer logic requirements 
results of operations net revenue in thousands change change net revenues 
   xilinx s net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the significant growth in xcxl  xcxla  xc  spartan tm  and virtex product lines  which was partially offset by decreased revenues in our mature xc family 
the increase in fiscal over was primarily due to the penetration in high growth end markets attributable to the xcex  xcxl and xc product lines 
we classify our product offerings into four categories by semiconductor manufacturing process technology 
these four product categories are adjusted on a regular basis to accommodate corresponding changes in our technology 
advanced products include our newest technologies manufactured on micron and smaller processes  which include the xcxv  xcxla  spartan xl  spartan ii  virtex  and virtex e product lines 
advanced products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and the significant increases in revenues of advanced products were due to the introduction and strong market acceptance of xcxla  spartan xl and virtex products 
mainstream products are currently manufactured on and micron technologies and include the xce  xcex  xcxl  xc  xc  xcxl  spartan and coolrunner product lines 
mainstream products represented of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal increases in revenues of were attributable mainly to growth in the xcxl  spartan  and xc product lines  along with the acquisition of coolrunner and introduction of xcxl 
base products consist of our mature product families that are currently manufactured on technologies of micron and older  this includes the xc  xc  xc  xc and xc families 
base products represented of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal our support products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include serial proms  hardwire  and software 
support products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues of base products decreased as customers migrated to newer product offerings while revenues of support products increased slightly due to increased revenues from serial proms 
no end customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  or the revenue by technology for the years ended march   and was as follows in millions base products

total revenue 


 in order to compete effectively  we pass on to customers manufacturing cost reductions by reducing prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable returns 
price erosion has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in unit cost 
we have historically been able to offset much of the revenue declines of our mature technologies with increased revenues from newer technologies  although no assurance can be given that we can continue to do so in the future 
international revenues represented approximately   and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
international revenues are derived from customers in europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world which represented approximately   and of our worldwide revenues  respectively  in fiscal as compared to approximately  and in fiscal in fiscal  europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world represented approximately  and of worldwide revenues  respectively 
europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world experienced significant revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to wider adoption of our new products in consumer and telecommunication applications and the economic recovery in japan and the asia pacific region 
japan and asia pacific rest of world experienced revenue declines in fiscal as compared to primarily due to a weak economic environment in those regions during fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for revenue by geography for the three years ended march   and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on all shipments to international distributors 
the change was made retroactive to the beginning of fiscal while we previously deferred revenue on shipments to domestic distributors until the products were sold to the end user  we recognized revenue upon shipment to international distributors  net of appropriate reserves for returns and allowances 
following the accounting change  revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the end customer 
we believe that deferral of revenue on shipments to distributors until the product is shipped by the distributor to an end customer is a more meaningful measurement of results of operations as it better conforms to the substance of the transaction considering the changing business environment in the international marketplace  is consistent with industry practice  and accordingly  it will focus us better on end customer sales  therefore it is a preferable method of accounting 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method for prior years was a charge of million  net of million in taxes  or net income per diluted share 
gross margin in thousands 





change change gross margin 






   percentage of revenue 
during fiscal  our gross margin percentage increased slightly from the prior year as efficiencies from increased production volumes resulted in decreased costs as a percentage of revenue 
in fiscal  our gross margin percentage declined from fiscal as a result of a non recurring royalty payment made pursuant to a license settlement with lemelson foundation partnership which was partially offset by lower wafer prices from wafer suppliers  manufacturing process technology improvements  and improved yields that offset selling price reductions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize that ongoing price reductions for our integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding the demand for our products 
management believes that a gross margin objective of approximately of revenues is consistent with expanding demand while realizing acceptable returns  although there can be no assurance that future gross margins can remain in this range 
research and development in thousands 





change change research and development 
   percentage of revenue 
we increased our expenditures in research and development as we have done each year during our sixteen year history 
the increase in research and development expenditures from fiscal to was due to designing and developing new product architectures of complex  high density devices including wafer purchases  development of advanced process technologies using micron and micron technologies  software development  increased labor related costs  and testing of new products  along with increased costs associated with the acquisition of the coolrunner cpld business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to was due to increased labor related expenses along with increased costs associated with the assets purchased from mi acquisition llp 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we remain committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to maintain our technology leadership in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   we have received over issued us patents and we maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of ic architecture  circuit design  and software 
sales  general and administrative in thousands 





change change sales  general and administrative 




   percentage of revenue 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased marketing expenses  increased outside sales commissions and sales incentives on higher revenues 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over due to increased marketing expenses and increased sales commissions on higher revenues from us distributors along with increased personnel costs 
although total sales  general and administrative expenses increased  they decreased as a percent of revenue because of strong revenue growth and improved operational efficiencies 
we remain committed to controlling administrative expenses 
however  the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of our intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may significantly increase in the future 
capital gain from merger of usic with umc in january  our equity position in united silicon inc usic was converted into shares of umc which are publicly traded on the taiwan stock exchange 
we recognized a gain of million million net of taxes in our fiscal fourth quarter as a result of the merger of usic with umc 
the gain represents the appreciation of our investment in usic 
as a result of this merger  we own approximately million umc shares  which represent approximately of the combined umc group 
we retain equivalent wafer capacity rights in umc as we previously had in usic  as long as we retain a percentage of our shares of umc common stock 
if our holdings fall below that percentage  our wafer capacity rights would be decreased prorated by the umc shares we hold 
due to restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange  the majority of our umc shares may not be sold until july these regulatory restrictions will gradually expire between july and january interest and other income  net in thousands 





change change interest income and other income  net 





   percentage of revenue 
we earn interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
the amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates 
in fiscal and  we incurred interest expense on the million convertible subordinated notes  which were fully converted in february average cash and investment balances increased from the prior year while interest rates remained relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the million decrease in interest expense related to the redemption of the convertible notes in february and increased interest income on higher average cash and investment balances 
in  average cash and investment balances decreased slightly from the prior year while interest rates increased moderately  keeping interest income constant from fiscal to fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense related to the redemption of the convertible notes offset partially by an increase in foreign currency exchange losses 
the amount of net interest and other income in the future will continue to be impacted by the level of our average cash and investment balance  prevailing interest rates  the balances of any debt outstanding  and foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for income taxes in thousands 







change change provision for taxes on income 
   effective tax rate 



the total provision for taxes on income in fiscal was million  including million in capital gains tax on the umc merger 
the combined rate for the fiscal year was 
the tax rates in fiscal and were lower than fiscal because of the r d tax credit and increased profits from foreign operations where the tax rate is lower than the us rate 
joint venture equity converted to umc shares we recorded our proportional ownership of the net income loss of usic  a wafer fabrication joint venture located in taiwan  as joint venture equity income loss prior to the conversion of usic shares to umc shares 
in fiscal  net gains were generated as usic began to realize volume wafer production and shipments 
the fiscal net loss was a result of the continued ramp up in production of the wafer fabrication facility 
net income in fiscal was primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains as well as interest earned on the usic investment portfolio 
as a result of the conversion of our equity position in usic to shares of umc in january  as discussed above  we will no longer record joint venture equity income 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation upon our financial results have not been significant 
we cannot assure  however  inflation will not affect us materially in the future 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our financial condition as of march  continued to be strong with total current assets exceeding total current liabilities by times 
at march   total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by times 
we have used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash flow from operations to support on going business activities  secure acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies  obtain facilities and capital equipment  and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
additionally  our investment in umc is available for future sale  subject to restrictions 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in fiscal as we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represented of total assets at march  during fiscal  we generated cash flow of million from operating activities and million from financing activities  offset by million of cash used for investing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included million in net purchases of investments  million expenditures for property  plant and equipment  and million for the purchase of philips cpld business 
financing activities during included million in proceeds from sales of common stock under employee option and stock purchase plans and million from sales of put warrants partially offset by million of treasury stock acquisitions 
receivables receivables increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increased level of shipments 
inventories inventories increased from million at march to million at march inventory levels increased during fiscal due to increased inventory requirements to support revenue growth and a planned build up of inventory for newer products 
additionally  inventory levels  measured as days of sales  declined at distributors compared to the prior fiscal year end due to the timing of shipments 
we attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet anticipated customer demand 
on the other hand  we also wish to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements 
we continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
property  plant and equipment during  we invested million in property and equipment  as compared to million in primary investments in fiscal were for corporate building and land purchases  software development tools and semiconductor design tools  and test and manufacturing equipment at each of our manufacturing and test locations 
current liabilities current liabilities increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in accounts payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors 
the increase in accounts payable was a result of business expansion and the increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to increased inventory build up at distributors in response to higher customer demand 
long term debt and lines of credit in fiscal  we converted in full million of convertible subordinated notes due for a total of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we have credit facilities for up to million of which million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for our ireland manufacturing facility 
at march  and  no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in fiscal to  million 
the increase of million was attributable to million in net income  million related to the issuance of common stock from employee stock plans and the tax benefit from stock options  million from unrealized gains on available for sale securities and our cumulative translation adjustment  and million related to the sale of put warrants partially offset by the million used to acquire treasury stock 
summary of liquidity we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the risk factors discussed below could affect our cash positions adversely 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that would complement our businesses 
we may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
factors affecting future operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and cyclical market patterns 
cyclical market patterns are characterized by several factors  including reduced product demand  limited visibility of demand for products beyond three months  accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and tight capacity availability 
our results of operations are affected by several factors 
these factors include general economic conditions  conditions specific to technology companies and to the semiconductor industry in particular  decreases in average selling prices over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions by us  our competitors and others 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  the impact of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others  and the inability to predict the success of our customers products in their markets 
market demand for our products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
due to these and other factors  our past results  including those described in this report  are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older  more stable and less dynamic industries 
based on the factors noted herein  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
our future success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key technical  sales  marketing and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
particularly important are those highly skilled design  process  software and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
sales and operations outside of the united states subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
for example  we have sales and operations in asia pacific and japan 
past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues  and such conditions may occur in the future 
customers may face reduced access to capital and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 
in addition  our ability to sell at competitive prices may be diminished 
currency instability may increase credit risks as the weak currencies may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the near future 
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on the global economy 
any instability in worldwide economic environments could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers 
additional risks to us include government regulation of exports  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods 
moreover  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts in taiwan where our main foundry partner  umc  is located 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect  if any  such actions would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not directly manufacture our silicon wafers 
presently  all of our wafers are manufactured by our foundry partners in taiwan by umc and in japan by seiko 
we depend on our foundry partners to deliver reliable silicon wafers  with acceptable yields  in a timely manner 
if our foundry partners are unable to produce and deliver silicon wafers that meet our specifications  including acceptable yields  our results of operation could be adversely affected 
our foundry partners in taiwan and japan and many of our operations in california are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past 
should there be a major earthquake in our operating locations in the future  our operations  including our manufacturing activities  may be disrupted 
this type of disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
dependence upon independent manufacturers and subcontractors we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
during the past several years  most of our wafers have been manufactured by umc and seiko  with recent wafers also manufactured by usic until its merger into umc 
we are dependent upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields and delivering them in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met our requirements to date  we cannot guarantee that our wafer suppliers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies 
additionally  disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including natural disasters such as fires  floods  or earthquakes  as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity  natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely delivery  or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain additional wafer fabrication capacity and assembly services from suppliers that are cost competitive 
we consider various alternatives in order to secure additional wafer capacity 
these alternatives include  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to independent wafer manufacturers 
we also consider the use of contracts which commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
we are currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner 
however  at times we have been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services to satisfy customer delivery dates  as well as our ability to process products for shipment 
in addition  a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of such wafers 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products which address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price  density  functionality and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies  achieving acceptable yields  availability of supporting software design tools  utilization of predefined cores of logic  market acceptance  and successful deployment of systems by our customers 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that our new products will achieve market acceptance 
revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future 
as a result  we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products along with cost reductions on current products 
we rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition see competition discussed in item intellectual property we rely upon patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  have asserted patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we cannot assure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
see part ii other information  item legal proceedings for a discussion of litigation between xilinx and altera corporation 
euro currency beginning in  member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
during the three year transition  the euro will be available for non cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain legal tender 
we are continuing to assess the euro s impact on our business 
we are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle the conversion  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies  the legal and contractual implications of agreements  as well as reviewing our pricing strategies 
we expect that any additional modifications to our operations and systems will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe the conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully modify all systems and contracts to comply with euro requirements 
litigation we are currently engaged in several legal matters 
see legal proceedings in item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item item a 
market rate risks interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
the portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds  tax advantaged auction rate preferred municipal bonds  commercial paper  and us treasury securities 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a million and million less than for both years decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  we have historically had the ability and have the intent to hold our securities until maturity and therefore  do not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
foreign currency risk we use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks 
our sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of processed silicon wafers from japanese foundries are primarily denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transactions are settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in the current period 
a adverse change in yen exchange rates  based on historical average rate fluctuations  would have had approximately a adverse impact on revenue for fiscal years  and in fiscal  we have also begun to share the yen exchange rate risk with some of our japanese customers through risk sharing agreements 
as we will continue to have a net yen exposure in the near future  we will continue to mitigate the exposure through yen hedging contracts 
however  no currency forward contracts were outstanding as of march  our investments in several subsidiaries and in the umc securities are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each month end during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
if permanent changes occur in exchange rates after an investment is made  the investment s value will increase or decrease accordingly 
these fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
also  as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur
