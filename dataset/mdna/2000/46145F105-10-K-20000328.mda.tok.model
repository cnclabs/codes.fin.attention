occupancy and equipment the increase in headcount  infrastructure enhancements and costs to address potential problems related to the year issue resulted in increased equipment purchases and the associated depreciation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  the expansion of our research and development facility in culver city  california  in july resulted in an increase in rent expense 
telecommunications and data processing services the million increase in telecommunications and data processing services stems primarily from fees to upgrade client data feeds  including market data line connections  increase in communication charges from linking clients to itg in new york and boston  and increases in dial up costs related to the increase in itg platform installations 
this increase was offset primarily by a decrease in spending on contingency related planning and implementation 
net loss on long term investments the increase in loss on long term investment in over primarily resulted from the recorded gain on sale of our equity investment in the longview group  inc in totaling million 
excluding the effects of this gain on sale  losses incurred by our investments in itg europe and itg australia were million less in than in  we also recognized a million deferred gain on the sale of the longview group that was held in escrow for one year

additionally  subsequent to our spin off  specified administrative services previously provided to us at a fixed monthly fee by jefferies group  inc were performed by itg 
this change resulted in higher legal  audit and accounting fees offset in part by reduced administrative service fees

a decrease in specialist fees of and floor broker fees of  was offset by the volume increases in shares executed by specialists of and floor brokers of  resulting in a net increase in transaction processing expenses 
transaction processing as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in software royalties 
as software royalties are contractually fixed at of posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment 
the increase in occupancy and equipment is primarily attributable to additional depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements representing of the increase and rent expense representing of the increase related to the relocation and expansion of our corporate headquarters occupied in june  combined with increases in headcount and purchases of additional technologically advanced software 
telecommunications and data processing services

spin off costs 
the spin off expenses are attributable to our legal  accounting  consulting and other expenses incurred for the spin off transactions

the increase in other general and administrative expenses was the result of a write off of a net receivable from the former global posit joint venture of approximately million  accelerated software amortization for specific products  increases in business development costs  such as advertising and active sales efforts  and additional administrative costs  associated with itg europe 
additionally  we had an increase in consulting expense primarily due to accounting and financial research of international joint venture opportunities and a major telecommunication system conversion 
income tax expense the increase in income tax expense is the result of an increase in pretax income and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the effective rate was due to certain non deductible expenses  such as goodwill amortization and spin off costs and the inability to offset international losses with united states profits in calculating income tax expense  that were not present in dependence on major customers during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue

during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities offered through posit  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the system 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefits  transaction processing fees and software royalty fees 
historically  cash from operations has met all working capital requirements 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that generally mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned at fair value include highly liquid  variable rate municipal securities  auction rate preferred stock and common stock 
at december   cash equivalents and securities owned at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other  of million were due within days 
a special cash dividend of million was paid on april  in connection with the spin off from jefferies group 
see note  organization and basis of presentation spin off from jefferies group  in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without any significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities  a hedged convertible managed account  and a venture capital fund amounting to million in the aggregate 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy to capitalize on short term price movements 
our managed account is employing a hedged convertible strategy 
we classify the securities under our managed account within securities owned  at fair value and securities sold  not yet purchased  at fair value 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc have been provided by cash from operations 
we believe that cash flows from operations will provide itg inc with sufficient regulatory capital 
as of december   we had net excess regulatory capital of million 
we had an agreement with a bank to borrow up to million on a revolving basis to enable itg inc to satisfy its regulatory net capital requirements 
this commitment expired on march  although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
in  we established a million credit line with a bank to fund temporary regulatory capital shortfalls encountered periodically by itg australia 
the lender charges us interest at the federal funds rate plus 
we lend amounts borrowed to itg australia and charge interest at the federal funds rate plus 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this bank credit line and no amounts were owed to us by itg australia 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in north america in recent years have had a significant effect on our revenue or profitability 
however  high inflation may lead to higher interest rates which might cause investment funds to move from equity securities to debt securities or cash equivalents 
the year issue we spent an aggregate of million  of which we spent million in  to upgrade or replace computer and software systems in order to address potential problems related to the year issue 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
it identifies the characteristics of internal use software and provides examples to assist in determining when the computer software is for internal use 
the company has adopted this sop effective january  which has had no material effect on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market price risk as part of our full service equity trade execution business we do not engage in proprietary trading  however  at times we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk which can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  certain positions may be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we have established approval policies that include review by the president or his designee and our compliance department of any proprietary trading activity 
our operations department reviews all open trades intraday in an effort to ensure that any open issues are addressed and resolved by the close of the trading day 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we employ a cash management strategy which seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash which is not needed for normal operations is invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
we currently have investments in municipal bonds  auction rate preferred bonds  common stock and convertible bonds 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million 
we will from time to time  make investments that are considered strategic 
these investments require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
this component of our cash management strategy is reevaluated periodically 
at december   investments in limited partnerships  venture capital investments and securities available for sale were approximately million 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the interest bearing portions of our investment portfolio 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds  highly liquid variable rate municipal securities  convertible bonds and preferred stock 
these investments totaled approximately million at december  our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
foreign currency risk we are pursuing the international market in a variety of ways  including joint ventures in europe and australia and the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel which focus on developing services for the european market 
our investments in these joint ventures and development activities expose us to currency exchange fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  australian dollar  canadian dollar and israeli new shekel 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
however  non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs
