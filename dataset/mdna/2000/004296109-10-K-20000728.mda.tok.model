jetform and its wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the company 
results of operations the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from period to period 
with the exception of its consulting services operation  the company has historically operated with little backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
the company records product revenue from packaged software and irrevocable commitments to purchase products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable 
as a result  product revenue in any period is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that period and on the receipt of irrevocable commitment license agreements 
product revenue is difficult to forecast due to the fact that the company s sales cycle  from initial trial to multiple copy licenses  varies substantially from customer to customer 
as a result  variations in the timing of product sales can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period 
product revenue represented of total revenue for the year ended april  service revenue primarily consists of consulting services  training and technical support 
consulting services include assisting customers to configure  implement and integrate the company s products and  when required  customize products and design automated processes to meet customers specific business needs

the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
as a result  the company s primary customer base  large financial services organizations and government agencies  who are deeply affected by the year problem due to their reliance on computer systems  focused their information technology resources on ensuring year readiness 
this had an impact on the company s ability to sell enterprise wide licenses to these customers during the years ended april  and the company also experienced a shift of focus by its customers to internet based solutions from more traditional client server solutions and the emergence of new competitors in the areas of process automation  document presentment and pre packaged solutions 
the company has developed a comprehensive strategy to address the market for internet based solutions and the increase in competition 
however  there can be no assurance that revenue derived from this strategy will be sufficient to offset the decrease in revenue from the company s client server products

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june   the fasb issued sfas no  which delays the effective date of sfas until fiscal years beginning after june  currently  as the company has no derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
would have no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
to the extent the company begins to enter into such transactions in the future  the company will adopt the statement s disclosure requirements in the quarterly and annual financial statements for the year ending april  on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin  providing new accounting rules for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
fin does not change fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
the new rules are significant and will result in compensation expense in several situations in which no expense is typically recorded under current practice  including option repricing  purchase business combinations and plans that permit tax withholdings 
fin is generally effective for transactions occurring after july   but apply to repricings and some other transactions after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which was amended in march by sab a 
the sab summarizes certain of the sec staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab is effective beginning the company s first quarter of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of this sab to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
the year the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
in addition  similar problems may arise in some systems  which use certain dates in to represent something other than a date 
although the change in date has occurred  it is not possible to conclude that all aspects of the year issue that may affect the entity  including those related to customers  suppliers or other third parties  have been fully resolved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to its investment portfolio and its credit facility with its bank 
the company primarily invests its cash in short term high quality securities with reputable financial institutions 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which management believes would not have a material impact on the financial position of the company 
the company has a committed million credit facility with the royal bank of canada 
the credit facility is made up of i a million term loan facility which bears interest at a rate of over the bankers acceptance rate of the bank from time to time and is payable on february   and ii a million revolving line of credit which bears interest at the prime rate of the canadian bank from time to time 
as at april   the company had drawn all of the million term loan facility and fixed the interest rate until july  at 
the company had no borrowings against its revolving line of credit as at april  the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended april  would have been less than  foreign currency risk the company has net monetary asset and liability balances in foreign currencies other than the canadian dollar  including the us dollar us  the pound sterling gbp  the australian dollar aud  the swedish krona sek  the german mark dm  the french franc ff  the irish punt iep  the euro eur  and the japanese yen jpy 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in canadian and us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar will have an impact on the company s reported cash position 
as at april   a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would not have had a material impact on the company s reported cash and cash equivalents balance
