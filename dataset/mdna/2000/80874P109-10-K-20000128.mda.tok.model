pari mutuel operations include all aspects of our pari mutuel service business  which encompass our north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  video gaming  and sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
venue management includes the connecticut off track betting operations and our netherlands on track and off track betting operations 
lottery operations include both domestic and international lottery service operations which includes tele control  our european on line lottery business which was sold in april  as well as sales of lottery systems and equipment 
during fiscal  the company commenced negotiations to sell its sjc video business 
we are the leading provider of computerized pari mutuel wagering systems to the north american racing industry and are also a leading provider of such systems worldwide 
we also own and operate the connecticut otb  are the exclusive licensed operator of all pari mutuel wagering in the netherlands and are one of the leading providers of simulcasting services to the racing industry in the united states and europe 
additionally  we provide technologically advanced vgms to the north american racing industry for use at racetracks 
we also provide lottery systems and services to three states in the united states and latin america and we provide lottery equipment internationally 
historically  our revenues have been derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide wagering systems and other services  which are typically based on a percentage of handle and or daily or monthly fees  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities owned or leased by us 
sales revenues are derived from sales contracts for wagering equipment  services and software 
the first quarter of our fiscal year and a portion of our second fiscal quarter traditionally comprise the weakest season for pari mutuel wagering service revenue 
wagering equipment sales revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions which do not recur on an annual basis  but which historically have given rise to additional terminal and systems software sales to existing customers 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales 
in addition  our operating results may vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition the german pari mutuel service business in fiscal  and the netherlands pari mutuel venue management business in fiscal  which were accounted for as purchases  and the sale of the european lottery business in fiscal  all affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to consolidated financial statements

this improvement primarily reflects revenues from the new nasrin tm operation and improved simulcasting revenues in germany 
these improvements were partially offset by the loss of a french pari mutuel service contract and fewer sales of excess transponder time in the domestic simulcasting operations 
pari mutuel equipment sales revenues of million in fiscal increased million or from the prior year  primarily due to sales of a system to the irish horseracing association  extrema tm terminals to the uk tote and max terminals to other international customers 
venue management operations service revenues of million in fiscal improved million or from the prior year 
this improvement primarily reflects revenues from the netherlands operations that were acquired in july  higher connecticut otb revenues attributable to increased handle and the september opening of the race book at the mohegan sun casino 
lottery operations service revenues increased million in fiscal to million primarily due to the april launch of the montana lottery 
lottery equipment sales revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the fiscal sales of approximately  extrema tm terminals for use in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations  and the march delivery of a central system  terminals and communications equipment to the montana lottery 
sjc video service revenues decreased million in fiscal to million due to changes in customer preference from video production to film 
gross profit analysis the total gross profit earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  of million in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel operations of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due higher profits in north american pari mutuel service operations  sales of extrema tm terminals to the uk tote operations  sales of max terminals to other international customers  and a full year of operation of the nasrin tm business 
these gross profit increases were partially offset by lower profit in the french pari mutuel operations due to the loss of a service contract in fiscal gross profits earned by the venue management operations of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due to the growth in handle in the connecticut otb operations 
gross profits earned by the lottery operations of million for fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  primarily due to sales of extrema tm terminals for use in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations and the march delivery of a central system  terminals and communications equipment to the montana lottery 
gross profit as a percent of revenues in our services businesses was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting  primarily  lower margins on the netherlands operations that were acquired in july of fiscal  partially offset by improved earnings in otb operations and a full year of operations of the nasrin tm business 
gross profit as a percent of equipment sales was in fiscal  a decrease from the gross profit percent of in fiscal as a result of a change in the mix of equipment and systems sold 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing  sales  administrative  engineering and software development  finance  legal and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the inclusion of the netherlands operations acquired in july and lower expenses reported in fiscal resulting from the collection of receivables previously reserved due to concerns about their recoverability 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation decreased by million primarily due to the lengthening of depreciable lives of pari mutuel terminals from seven to ten years effective november   as the result of the renewal of a number of service contracts and realized equipment durability 
additionally  in fiscal  we completed the installation of new lottery terminals for the connecticut state lottery under a contract with an initial five year term plus five one year options to extend the contract through may based on industry practice of lottery contracts and our historical relationship with the connecticut state lottery for the past ten years  we are depreciating the terminals and installation costs on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives of years 
amortization expenses decreased by million primarily as a result of the full amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal interest expense of million in fiscal increased million from fiscal as a result of borrowings in connection with the fiscal installation of the connecticut lottery terminals 
other expense of million in fiscal consisted primarily of currency translation expenses  and other income of million in fiscal consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash 
loss on disposition of business a charge of million was recorded to reflect the expected loss on disposition by sale of the sjc video production business as compared to a net loss on disposition of businesses of million in fiscal in fiscal  the sjc video production business incurred an operating loss of million 
income taxes income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income tax expense principally reflects state taxes on connecticut otb operations and foreign taxes in fiscal  and foreign taxes in fiscal  since no tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis revenues increased or million to million in the fiscal year ended october  from million in the fiscal year ended october pari mutuel operations service revenues of million for fiscal increased 
million or from million in the prior year 
this improvement primarily reflects growth in handle in the north american pari mutuel operations as a result of the addition of six new north american racetracks and otb sites  full card simulcasting at three north american racetrack customers  an increase in the number of vgm machines  and the addition of the new german simulcasting business 
these increases were mostly offset by lower revenues in the north american simulcasting operations due to lower ad hoc sales of satellite time following the reduction in number and realignment of leased transponders due to the failure of the galaxy iv satellite  and by the loss of a service contract in our french operations 
sales revenue  primarily consisting of export sales  were million in fiscal  comparable to sales revenues of million in the prior year 
venue management operations service revenues of million for fiscal increased million or from million in the prior year 
this improvement includes million from the netherlands operations  which was acquired in july  and revenue increases of million as a result of growth in handle in the connecticut otb operations 
lottery operations service revenues decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily because of the sale of the european lottery business in april sales revenues decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the non recurring sale of terminals to the israel lottery in fiscal  partially offset by the sale in fiscal of terminals for use in italy in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations 
sjc video service revenues decreased million reflecting a change in the mix of video contracts 
gross profit analysis total gross profits earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel operations of million in fiscal decreased million from million in fiscal  principally due to lower profit on our french pari mutuel operations  primarily as a result of the loss of a operations service contract and the resulting costs arising from the termination of employees and the resizing of the business to better serve the reduced french market 
also contributing to the decline in gross margin were the lost profits from the sales of excess transponder time as a result of the decrease in leased and available transponders  coupled with higher transponder leased costs following the failure of the galaxy iv satellite in may  lower margins in the european pari mutuel operations as a result of efforts to start up and expand business opportunities  and start up costs for the new nasrin tm business 
these decreases were partially offset by the improved profitability at the north american pari mutuel operations 
gross profits earned by the venue management operations of million in fiscal improved million over fiscal profits of million as a result of the addition of the netherlands operations in july  and the growth in handle in the connecticut otb operations 
gross profits earned by the lottery operations of million for fiscal  decreased by million from million in fiscal this decline is attributable to a million decline in european lottery gross profits due to the sale of this business unit in april  coupled with lower domestic lottery margins as the result of the installation of the new connecticut lottery terminals and lower margins on equipment sales  reflecting a change in the mix of products sold in each period 
gross profits as a percent of revenues in our services businesses were approximately for fiscal  or below margins earned in fiscal  reflecting lower margins on the recently acquired business in the netherlands  higher transponder lease costs in simulcasting  lower margins in the european pari mutuel operations as a result of efforts to start up and expand business opportunities  extra costs incurred in connection with the connecticut lottery installation  and start up costs for the nasrin tm business 
gross profits as a percent of equipment sales were for fiscal  compared to gross profits on such sales of in fiscal the decrease is due to the sale of the european lottery business in  coupled with the lower margins on fiscal equipment sales reflecting the change in mix of products sold in each period 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  partially reflecting the absence of expenses for businesses sold in fiscal excluding businesses sold  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased or million as a result of lower bad debt and legal expenses arising from the collection of receivables previously reserved as doubtful due to concerns about their recoverability  and cost savings programs in europe 
partially offsetting these decreases are the added expenses of the recently acquired netherlands operations and the expense of completing the test phase and initial rollout of the nasrin tm communication network 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the absence of expenses related to the businesses sold in fiscal excluding businesses sold  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or as a result of the full amortization of certain intangible assets and lower depreciation on north american pari mutuel assets and lottery assets in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by the accelerated amortization of deferred transponder costs as a result of the galaxy satellite failure and accelerated amortization of goodwill in the french operations resulting from the loss of a major service contract 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million increase reflects higher borrowing levels to finance the installation of the new connecticut lottery terminals and higher interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense was million in fisca compared to million in fiscal income tax expense principally reflects foreign tax expense  since no us federal tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
the decrease in income tax expense principally reflects the sale of the european lottery business 
liquidity and capital resources on may   the parent company and autotote lottery corporation entered into a million  three year term loan arrangement the term loan to finance the development and installation of the lottery system for the connecticut state lottery  including the manufacture of approximately three thousand new lottery terminals

in addition  the term loan is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our connecticut lottery assets now owned or hereafter acquired 
also  under the terms of the request for proposal for the development and installation of the lottery system for the connecticut state lottery  we provided a performance bond in the initial amount million  which was automatically increased to million upon the effective date of the agreement  may  on july   we issued million of senior notes due august  see note to consolidated financial statements  which were exchanged for million of series b notes due the notes in connection with our exchange offer in october the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually on each february and august the notes are senior  unsecured obligations of ours  ranking senior in right and priority of payment to all indebtedness of ours that by its terms is expressly subordinated to the notes 
the notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries 
the notes will be redeemable  in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after august   at redemption prices of in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year and thereafter  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
in addition  at any time prior to august   we may  at our option  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity offerings  as defined  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  if any  provided  however  that at least of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding immediately after any such redemption 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability  as defined  to incur additional indebtedness  create certain liens  pay dividends  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting fees and expenses of approximately million  were approximately million  of which approximately million was used to repay million of indebtedness and million of accrued interest under the previously existing senior bank credit facility the senior facility 
in addition  approximately million of the net proceeds was used to repurchase  at a discount  subordinated debentures totaling million plus accrued interest and fees see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we also entered into a new revolving credit facility the facility with certain lenders which matures in february the facility provides for borrowings of up to million  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the facility requires mandatory commitment reductions upon the occurrence of certain events  including asset sales and the incurrence of certain indebtedness  in each case  in excess of specified thresholds 
in addition  we may make optional prepayments and commitment reductions 
borrowings under the facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and will bear interest at the base rate as defined plus a margin ranging from to per annum  or the eurodollar rate as defined plus a margin ranging from to per annum  in each case depending on our performance as measured by the ratio of net debt as defined to ebitda as defined 
fees will be payable on outstanding letters of credit equal to the applicable eurodollar rate margin as of october   plus a facing fee of per annum 
a commitment fee of per annum is payable on the unused amount of the facility 
obligations under the facility are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our us subsidiaries 
in addition  the facility is secured by i first priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of ours and our us subsidiaries  and ii a first priority lien on all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and on of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries 
the facility contains certain covenants which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make restricted payments  including dividends  engage in mergers  consolidations and asset sales  make acquisitions  investments and capital expenditures  and engage in certain transactions with certain subsidiaries and affiliates  in each case beyond certain thresholds 
the facility also requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including maintenance of minimum ebitda and interest coverage levels  and a maximum net debt to ebitda ratio 
in december  our lenders agreed to amend certain covenants contained in the notes and the facility agreements to permit us to incur additional debt and to utilize working capital in order to complete business expansions in europe 
although there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at october   approximately million of letters of credit were guaranteed under the facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at october   our available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at october  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase reflects improved earnings  realization of customer deposits  and the increase in accounts payable incurred in connection with increased manufacturing activities 
partially offsetting these increases were payments of liabilities incurred in fiscal in connection with the european cost savings efforts and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the netherlands operation  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories related to higher export sales and manufacturing activities 
in fiscal  we used available cash plus the cash provided by operating activities to invest in million of capital and contract expenditures and in software development  to invest million in german business acquisitions  and to repay million of long term debt 
at october   current liabilities exceeded current assets by million  an increase of million from october  this increase is principally due to the use of available cash and cash provided by operating activities to fund capital expenditures and repay long term debt 
these cash resources were not replenished by long term borrowings as of october  we anticipate a comparable level of investment in contract expenditures in fiscal at october   we had million in cash and million of borrowing availability under the facility 
we believe that our cash resources  anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the facility should provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements  scheduled interest payments and anticipated capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
we believe that additional financing will be required to enable us to meet our debt service obligations  including scheduled principal payments under the notes  the subordinated debentures  the term loan and the facility  beginning in fiscal extraordinary items in connection with the issuance of the notes in the third quarter of fiscal  and the subsequent repayment of all amounts outstanding under the previously existing bank credit facility the senior facility see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we wrote off million of deferred financing fees associated with the senior facility 
we also used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repurchase million of our subordinated debentures for million  resulting in a million gain on the early retirement of this debt 
there were no tax benefits recognized on the net extraordinary loss because we are currently in a tax loss carryforward position 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
sfas is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending october  the company has not determined the impact that sfas will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
year we are dedicated to providing uninterrupted  high quality performance from our computer software systems  products and satellite communications network before  during and after year since fiscal  we have tested our critical systems  surveyed our principal suppliers  identified all internal systems with date related deficiencies  developed solutions for those internal systems that have been found to have date related deficiencies  and remediated any deficient systems 
as a result of our planning and remediation  we encountered no significant problems with any of our systems as we entered the year we will continue to monitor our systems and take appropriate actions  when and if necessary 
we do not expect to encounter any significant problems with year date related deficiencies  however  our belief and expectations may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
euro conversion in connection with the january  conversion by eleven member states of the european union to a common currency  the euro  the company has evaluated the implications of the conversion and expects that it will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as the company seeks debt and equity capital to sustain its operations 
at october   substantially all of the company s debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
we consider the fair value of all financial instruments to be not materially different from their carrying value at year end 
the company does not use derivative instruments or hedging to manage its exposures and does not currently hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes in any event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customers account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding fair value of financial instruments
