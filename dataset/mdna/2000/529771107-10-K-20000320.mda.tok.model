item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview lexmark international group  inc group  and together with its subsidiaries  the company or lexmark is an integrated global developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions and products  including laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies for the office and home markets 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms for business users 
in addition lexmark develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products which include supplies for international business machines corporation ibm branded printers  aftermarket supplies for original equipment manufacturer oem products  and typewriters and typewriter supplies that are sold under the ibm trademark 
in the past few years  the worldwide printer industry has seen substantial growth in demand for laser and inkjet printers as a result of increasing penetration of personal computers into home markets and the office migration to local area networks from mainframes 
during this period  the company s own product mix has evolved  with its laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies representing an increasing percentage of its sales volume and revenues  particularly as the increasing base of installed lexmark printers generates additional revenues from recurring sales of supplies for those printers primarily laser and inkjet cartridges 
lexmark believes that its total revenues will continue to grow due to overall market growth and increases in the company s market share in both the office desktop network laser and color inkjet printer categories 
management believes that this growth will more than offset reduced demand for dot matrix impact printers and declines in sales of ibm branded supplies as well as typewriters and typewriter supplies that are sold under the ibm trademark 
in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenues due to selling price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  unit price reductions are partially offset by the tendency of customers to move up to higher priced printer models with faster speeds  greater network connectivity and other new features 
in the inkjet printer market  advances in color inkjet technology have resulted in lower prices for printers with sharper resolution and improved performance 
the greater affordability of color inkjet printers has been an important factor in the recent growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser and inkjet printers continues to grow  the market for their associated supplies will grow as such supplies are continually purchased throughout the life of the printers 
the company expects this recurring and relatively high margin business to contribute to the stability of the company s earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriters and other impact supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products and pursue the aftermarket oem supplies opportunity  while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
the company expects that its overall operating margins will remain relatively stable as the associated printer supplies become an increasing part of its business 
although the company expects continuing declines in printer prices  it expects to be able to reduce costs generally in line with price decreases

the senior notes are guaranteed by group and contain restrictions on liens  sale leaseback transactions  mergers and sales of assets

there are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time  at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement  in whole or in part  at the option of international 
a balance of million net of unamortized discount of million was outstanding at december  in october  the company amended the agreement to sell its us trade receivables on a limited recourse basis 
the maximum amount of us trade receivables to be sold was increased from million to million 
as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and  due to the revolving nature of the agreement  million also remained outstanding 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and also remained outstanding 
the agreement  which contains customary financial covenants  must be renewed annually  and is expected to be renewed upon its expiration in october the risk the company bears from bad debt losses on us trade receivables sold is limited to approximately of the outstanding balance of receivables sold 
the company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold may not include amounts over days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
in  the company entered into three year interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million  whereby the company pays interest at a fixed rate of approximately and receives interest at a floating rate equal to the three month libor 
since may  the swaps serve as a hedge of the receivables financings which are based on floating interest rates 
as of december   the company s board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to billion of its class a common stock 
this repurchase authority allows the company at management s discretion to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its class a common stock for approximately million 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at prices ranging from to per share for an aggregate cost of approximately million  leaving approximately million of share repurchase authority 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the and capital expenditures were primarily due to expansion of printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity  including new manufacturing facilities in the philippines and the czech republic 
looking forward to  the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million and will include further expansion of printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity and research and development facilities 
the capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenues derived from international operations  including exports from the united states  made up approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  with european revenues accounting for about two thirds of international revenues 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
while currency translation has significantly affected international revenues and cost of revenues  it did not have a material impact on operating income for the years through the company attempts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in us and european markets as a result  in part  of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
tax matters the company s effective tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the income tax rate was primarily due to the effect of lower tax rates on manufacturing activities in certain countries 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  including million which are not expected to provide a future benefit because they are attributable to certain non us entities that are also taxable in the us inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
the company operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
however  the company actively manages its product costs and manufacturing processes in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases 
year update through the first two months of  lexmark has not experienced any significant difficulties associated with the year issue nor has the company s ability to manufacture  sell or ship products been impacted 
while management is encouraged by its year readiness and does not anticipate any significant year issues  the situation will continue to be monitored 
factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management 
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  variations in the cost of component parts  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and programs  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to increase printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity in line with growing market demands  to manage inventory levels to support the demands of new customers as well as its established customer base and to address production and supply difficulties 
the company s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis 
revenues derived from international sales  including exports from the united states  make up over half of the company s revenues 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets  in part  because of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that meet customers needs 
the markets for printers and associated supplies are increasingly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company and its major competitors  all of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their printers and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  the inkjet printer market has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant printer price pressure from the company s major competitors 
price reductions beyond expectations or the inability to reduce costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share  particularly at a time when the company is increasing its investment to support product introductions  expand capacity and enter new geographies 
the company markets and sells its products through several sales channels 
the company s future results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between its various sales channels 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results  cash flows  financial position or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the company s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including economic and business conditions  both national and international  the loss of significant customers or suppliers  the impact of any remaining year issues  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly the trading of large blocks and interday trading in the company s common stock  may affect the company s common stock price 
while the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations in connection with the preparation of its quarterly and annual reports  the company does not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this report 
the information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report  in any of the company s public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf 
the important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change  and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors 
by means of this cautionary note  the company intends to avail itself of the safe harbor from liability with respect to forward looking statements that is provided by section a and section e referred to above 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes is estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
such carrying value exceeded the fair value of debt at december  by approximately million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  the company has interest rate swaps that serve as a hedge of financings which are based on floating interest rates 
the fair value at december  was a liability of less than million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to less than million at december  foreign currency exchange rates the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro  other european currencies  the japanese yen and other asian and south american currencies 
exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts  put options  and call options with maturity dates of less than one year 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
