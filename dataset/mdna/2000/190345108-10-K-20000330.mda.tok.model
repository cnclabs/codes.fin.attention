item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that the company is the largest wholesale distributor of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs  and one of the largest distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for boats  in north america 
sales are made by the company to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
the company s sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
weather conditions also affect the usage of rvs and boats 
additionally  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline also can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
as a result  the company s sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  which affect the availability and affordability of financing for purchases of rvs and boats  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline  and unusually adverse weather conditions 
results of operations net sales 
net sales in increased by approximately  or as compared to  due primarily to an increase  during the first half of  in consumer demand for the products that we sell  which we believe resulted primarily from increases in sales and usage of recreational vehicles and boats 
operating results in also included a full year of sales from marine distributors  a marine products distribution business that we acquired late in may  the sales of which were therefore not included in our operating results for the first five months of net sales in increased by approximately  or as compared to  due to strengthening demand  new marketing programs implemented by the company  and the acquisition of marine distributors in may gross margin 
the company s gross margin increased to of net sales in from in and in these increases were due primarily to i selected price increases on the products that we sell  and ii the impact of fixed costs on a higher sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for from in this increase was primarily the result of costs associated with the installation of the company s new computer system  which became operational in the fourth quarter of and increased selling expenses due to the addition of marine sales personnel 
also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in were costs incurred in the relocation of our corporate headquarters from san jose  california to morgan hill  california that took place in the first quarter of as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in from in this decrease was due primarily to increased sales in and a reduction of the company s telephone expenses 
operating income 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in more than offset the increases in sales and gross margin achieved during the year  and therefore  operating income declined to  in as compared to  in the company increased its operating income in to  as compared to a loss from operations of  in due to increased sales and gross margin 
nearly all of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 
for several years  the company maintained minority ownership interests in several companies in related industries affiliated companies 
the company s ownership interests in these affiliated companies had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting  under which the company included in its operating results  as equity in net earnings loss of affiliates  its pro rata share of the net income of or any loss incurred by these companies 
h 
burden limited burden  a distributor of caravan and boating products in western europe  in which the company had owned a ownership interest  and hwh  inc hwh  a manufacturer of hydraulic leveling devices and other products for recreational vehicles  in which the company held a ownership interest  accounted for substantially all of the company s equity in the net earnings of affiliates 
in the second half of the company sold its ownership interest in burden for a cash price of  and  in early  it sold its ownership interest in hwh for a cash price of  in order to provide funds to support the growth of the company s core business of distributing after market products in north america 
as a result  equity in the net earnings of affiliates was not material in  or and is not expected to be material to the company s operating results in the future 
interest expense 
during interest expense decreased by  or  as compared to this decrease was largely the result of a reduction in the rate of interest that the company pays on its revolving line of credit 
during interest expense decreased by  or as compared to this decrease was the result of reductions in average long term borrowings outstanding as compared to those reductions were funded with proceeds from the sales of the company s investments in burden and hwh and  to a lesser extent  internally generated funds 
the company will continue to rely on borrowings to fund a substantial portion of its working capital requirements and future growth and  as a result  it anticipates that interest will continue to be a significant expense for the company 
income taxes benefit 
the company s effective income tax rate was in  in and in the substantial increase in the tax rate in and  as compared to  was due primarily to i an increase in non tax deductible expenses as a percentage of pre tax results  and ii an increase in income generated by the company s canadian subsidiary  because such income is taxed at higher rates in canada than the income tax rates applicable in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving bank credit facility and internally generated funds 
under that credit facility  which expires in may  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  with a seasonal increase to  between march and june of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory the borrowing base 
borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to the bank s prime rate plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at the bank s available libor rate  plus 
the company also has obtained a  term loan from the bank from which we obtained our revolving credit facility 
the proceeds were used to fund repurchases of our shares in and for other corporate purposes 
the term loan is repayable in monthly installments commencing in july  based on a three year amortization 
however  if the revolving credit facility is not extended beyond its maturity date of may   the remaining balance of the term loan will become due at that time 
term loan borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points or at the bank s libor rate plus basis points 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan totaled  borrowings under the credit facility and term loan are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and rank senior in priority to other indebtedness of the company 
the company believes that available credit under its revolving credit facility  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its working capital requirements and other cash requirements over the next twelve months 
the company does not presently anticipate any material increases in its cash requirements or material changes in its sources of funds in the foreseeable future 
the company generally uses cash for  rather than generating cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because the company builds inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as its customers begin increasing their product purchases for the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
the company generated cash from operating activities of   and  in  and respectively 
in the cash was generated primarily from non cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable 
in  the cash was generated primarily from non cash expenses and the receipt of income tax refunds arising from the taxable loss in in december  the company increased its inventory to prepare for its annual dealer sales show  which was held in january in prior years the show has been held in february 
as a result  the increase in inventories in anticipation of the dealer show in past years occurred in january  rather than the preceding december 
the company was able to decrease its inventory by  in and  in net cash used in investing activities was  in  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  in and  in during the first quarter of  the company received proceeds of  from the sale of its investment in hwh 
in the second half of  the company received proceeds of  from the sale of its investment in burden 
in may  the company used cash of  to acquire the inventory of marine distributors  inc  a distributor of marine products 
capital expenditures were  in   in and  in the increase in capital expenditures in was related to the acquisition and installation of the company s new computer system and  to a lesser extent  expenditures associated with the establishment of its new headquarters and national order office in morgan hill  california 
borrowings under the company s credit facility increased by  in  as compared to decreases of  in and  in in june  the company retired its outstanding senior subordinated notes with a final principal payment of  similar payments were made in each of and those payments were funded principally with borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit facility 
in early we adopted an open market and private stock repurchase program 
during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of  under this program 
we funded those purchases with proceeds of the term loan we obtained from our bank lender 
the stock repurchases accounted for the decrease in stockholders equity at december  we do not currently expect to make any purchases of shares during  unless we have opportunities to acquire additional shares at favorable prices 
the company leases the majority of its facilities and certain of its equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the company s future lease commitments are described in note e to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from april through september than we do during the remainder of the year 
because a substantial portion of the company s expenses are fixed  operating income declines and the company sometimes incurs losses and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements in months when sales are lower 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss   net earnings loss per share 



quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss   net earnings loss per share 



inflation 
generally  the company has been able to pass inflationary price increases on to its customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increase in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for the company s products 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with the company s canadian operations and its canadian currency denominated debt 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  the company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility approximate the carrying value of such obligations 
the company sometimes enters into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of its inventory purchases for its canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
the company believes that these agreements do not subject the company to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant 
this report contains forward looking information which reflects management s current views of future financial performance 
the forward looking information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the effect on future performance of changing product supply relationships in the industry and the uncertainties created by those changes  the potential for increased price competition  and possible changes in economic conditions  prevailing interest rates or gasoline prices  or the occurrence of unusually severe weather conditions  that can affect both the purchase and usage of rvs and boats and which  in turn  affects purchases by consumers of the products that the company sells 
for information concerning such factors and risks  see the foregoing discussion in this section of this report titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
due to such uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report
