item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in  we decided to change our business from the ownership of high risk  residential collateralized mortgage backed securities to the ownership  acquisition  development and management of manufactured home communities 
this decision helped us to avoid the volatility incurred by other owners of these securities following the capital market crisis in the third quarter of since may  we have been focused on the investment of our capital in the acquisition of manufactured home communities 
we have also been focused on the investment of commercial assets capital in the acquisition of manufactured home communities since august as of december   commercial assets has not yet substantially invested its capital in manufactured home communities 
inflation we do not believe that changes in inflation rates would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in fact  we believe that inflation may positively impact our business  in light of the fact that manufactured home communities represent a more affordable housing choice for many people than other alternatives available  increased inflation rates may allow us to demand increased rents without losing tenants 
comparison of to rental property operations rental and other property revenues from our owned properties totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  or

fee revenue from managing commercial assets was  in and  in the  increase is due to commercial assets investments in communities beginning in august we do not earn fees on cash and short term investments held by commercial assets which is what commercial assets primarily held in amortization of management contracts decreased from  for to  for due to our acquisition in february of two communities which we previously managed 
equity in earnings of commercial assets income from our interest in commercial assets was  for and  for commercial assets reported to us that its net income decreased by  from primarily due to  increase in depreciation on acquired manufactured home communities   increase in management fees paid to us and  of nonrecurring expenses in related to its decision to not invest in marinas  partially offset by  of nonrecurring expenses in related to its reincorporation 
due to our interest in commercial assets  however  during and   and  respectively  of the management fees paid by commercial assets to us have been reported by us as equity in earnings of commercial assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the  increase is primarily due to increases in the number of personnel 
interest and other income interest and other income was  in and  in the  decrease occurred primarily because prior to june  we had million in cash which we had invested in manufactured home communities by june interest expense interest expense was  during and  during the  increase is primarily due to borrowings used to acquire manufactured home communities after june income tax benefit a subsidiary recorded a loss for income tax purposes in as a result  it can carry back the tax loss for a refund of income taxes paid by the subsidiary in loss from early extinguishment of debt in  we prepaid a million note payable and paid a  prepayment penalty 
reincorporation expenses in  we incurred  of nonrecurring expenses related to our reincorporation in delaware

it resecuritized its portfolio in november and temporarily invested the proceeds in short term investments while considering alternative investments 
commercial assets announced that it intended to invest in manufactured home communities in the third quarter of  and as of december   it had invested million in communities 
commercial assets reported to us that the  decrease in commercial assets net income during as compared to was due to a  decrease as a result of lower yields during on short term investments and interests in manufactured home communities compared to yields on collateralized mortgage backed securities during  a  nonrecurring gain on the sale of the bonds recognized in  and a non recurring  expense in related to the cost of investigating marina investments 
non agency mbs bonds in march  we sold our portfolio of unrated credit support debt interests in non conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations known as non agency mbs bonds in order to reduce risk associated with this type of investment and to maximize long term  risk adjusted returns to stockholders 
consequently  income from non agency mbs bonds decreased to  for compared with  for revenues from non agency mbs bonds subsequent to march represent income from a residual interest retained from the sale 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  for compared to  for expenses decreased in by  primarily because of  of management fees to our former manager during and  of nonrecurring costs in related to our reverse stock split 
the cost decrease was partially offset by  in personnel and related expenses incurred in as a result of our becoming self administered and self managed in november interest and other income interest and other income for was  compared to  for the  decrease occurred because the proceeds we received in from the sale of our non agency mbs bonds were temporarily invested until they were used to acquire manufactured home communities

proposed merger with commercial assets 
in august  we agreed to merge with commercial assets 
we agreed to issue shares of our common stock for each share of commercial assets common stock 
alternatively  commercial assets stockholders may elect to receive per share in cash for up to  shares of commercial assets common stock with any remaining shares of commercial assets common stock receiving shares of our common stock 
based on the  shares of commercial assets common stock not already held by us  we will issue approximately  shares of our common stock if all commercial assets stockholders elect to receive shares of our common stock in the merger 
if commercial assets stockholders elect to receive the maximum amount of cash  then we will issue approximately  shares of our common stock and pay  cash to commercial assets stockholders in the merger 
the merger must be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and two thirds of the outstanding shares of commercial assets common stock 
we own of the outstanding shares of commercial assets common stock and have agreed to vote these shares in favor of the merger 
the stockholders meetings to vote on the merger are expected to occur in the second quarter of at december   we had an investment in commercial assets with a recorded amount of  based on the share price of our common stock on august  the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger  our summary pro forma balance sheet at december  would have been as follows under the two alternatives available to commercial assets stockholders 
the column titled all shares assumes all commercial assets stockholders elect to receive shares of our common stock 
the column titled shares and cash assumes commercial assets stockholders elect to receive the maximum amount of cash 
all amounts are in thousands 
pro forma asset investors all shares historical shares and cash real estate  net including participating mortgages and joint ventures    cash and short term investments   investment in commercial assets  other assets    total assets    secured notes payable    other liabilities    minority interest in operating partnership    stockholders equity    total liabilities and stockholders equity    the source of the funds to be paid to commercial assets stockholders who elect to receive cash in the merger up to a maximum of  is commercial assets million of cash and short term investments at december  and million in additional non recourse  secured long term notes payable borrowed by commercial assets in january additional pro forma information at december  would be as follows pro forma asset investors all shares historical shares and cash dollar amounts in thousands debt to equity ratio secured long term notes payable    secured short term financing    long term debt as a percent of total debt fixed rate debt    variable rate debt    fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on ffo  less an annual capital replacement reserve of at least per developed homesite 
we believe that the presentation of ffo  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  provides a useful measure of our performance 
however  ffo does not represent cash flow and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow or liquidity available to us  nor should it be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance 
the board of governors of nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo beginning with the nareit definition and include adjustments for o the minority interest in the operating partnership owned by persons other than us  o costs we incurred in order to become self managed  o amortization of property and investment management contracts  and o nonrecurring income  net 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides investors with measurements which help facilitate an understanding of our ability to make required dividend payments  capital expenditures and principal payments on our debt 
since ffo excludes unusual and nonrecurring expenses as well as depreciation and other real estate related expenses  ffo may be materially different from net income 
therefore  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our operating performance or liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
we use ffo in measuring our operating performance because we believe that the items that result in a difference between ffo and net income do not impact the ongoing operating performance of a real estate company 
also  we believe other real estate companies  analysts and investors utilize ffo in analyzing the results of real estate companies 
our basis of computing ffo is not necessarily comparable with that of other reits 
for  and  our ffo was as follows in thousands income before minority interest in operating partnership   real estate depreciation  including joint ventures   amortization of management contracts   costs incurred to acquire management contract   nonrecurring income  net equity in commercial assets adjustments for ffo  gain on sale of bonds  funds from operations ffo    weighted average common shares and op units outstanding    for  and  our net cash flows were as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities    cash provided by used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities    year compliance year issues have arisen because many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the current status of our year compliance program 
our hardware and software systems are currently year compliant 
upon failure of any system  data included in critical software such as rent rolls and certain record keeping systems could be transferred to alternative commercially available software at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time period 
consequently  we would be able to continue our business operations without any material interruption or material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have not experienced any year problems through march  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
moreover  because a large number of our tenants may be dependent on social security payments to pay their rents  a failure of the social security administration to cause their systems to be year compliant may result in a material adverse effect on our operations 
the social security administration has announced that they will have their systems year compliant before january  we have received oral representations from our third party vendors indicating that they are substantially year compliant 
we have not experienced any year problems through march  we believe that the cost of modification or replacement of our less essential accounting and reporting software and hardware that is not currently compliant with year requirements  if any  will not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is through our various debt instruments and borrowings 
the following is a list of these debt instruments and borrowing arrangements 
we have million of fixed rate  fully amortizing  non recourse  secured long term notes payable 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on these notes as the rates are fixed and the notes are fully amortizing 
we have million of fixed rate  non recourse  secured long term notes payable that mature in october the rates on these notes range from to with a weighted average rate of 
we intend to refinance the notes during with long term  fully amortizing  fixed rate debt 
therefore  changes in interest rates would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future to refinance the existing debt 
if the interest rate on the refinanced debt was greater than the weighted average rate on the existing debt  our annual net income and cash flows would decrease by  due to an increase in interest expense on these notes  based on the outstanding balances at december  we believe that the effect  if any  of near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for would not be material as the existing debt is fixed rate through september we have a million fixed rate  partially amortizing  non recourse  secured long term note payable that matures in april we do not have significant exposure to changes in interest rates since the interest rate is fixed and the balance due at maturity is million 
we have a million of recourse  secured long term note payable that bears interest at the day london interbank offered rate libor plus 
if libor increased immediately by  our annual net income and cash flows would decrease by  due to an increase in interest expense on this note payable  based on the outstanding balance at december  we have a recourse  secured line of credit that bears interest at libor plus 
as of december   the outstanding balance was million 
if libor increased immediately by  then our annual net income and cash flows would decrease by  due to an increase in interest expense on this line of credit  based on the outstanding balance at december
