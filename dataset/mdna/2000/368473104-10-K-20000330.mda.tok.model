in  sales increased  or  from  in to  in from to  sales increased by  or  from  in as a result of geerlings wade s focus on the internet during  a major contributor to sales growth were sales through the company s websites 
internet sales accounted for of geerlings wade s revenues compared to only in  the year that the company began selling wine through online ordering via its website 
in addition  the company was able to grow its revenue from catalog sales during  generating sales of  from its catalogs  a increase over sales of  from its catalogs 
catalogs generated sales of  sales from the passport wine club and the newbury street store in boston increased  as was the first full year of operation for both 
sales from house mailings increased marginally in as compared to in  sales from house mailings fell marginally from sales from acquisition mailings fell  in as compared to this was due to lower circulation of acquisition mailings in and to weaker response rates to these mailings in the first half of compared to sales from acquisition mailings increased  between and the number of cases sold by the company increased by  or  from  cases in to  cases in from to  the number of cases sold increased by  from  a increase 
the average number of cases purchased per customer increased from cases per year in to cases per year in in large part  the increase in in the average  annual number of cases purchased was a result of fewer sales in to first time buyers  who generally buy less than one case at the time of their first purchase 
conversely  the decrease in the average number of cases purchased in from cases per year in to cases per year in was due to the fact that there was an increase in first time buyers in while the average  annual number of cases purchased per customer increased from to  the average  annual number of cases purchased by repeat buyers decreased from to  from cases per repeat buyer in to cases in in  repeat buyers annually purchased an average of cases each

gross profit 
gross profit has continued to grow 
in  gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in from to  gross profit increased as well from  in  a change of 
during these periods  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in to in in both and  the increase in gross profit resulted from improved purchasing by the company 
in addition  in  the company was able to take advantage of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which also increased gross profits 
gross profits for all sales per case bottles of wine sold decreased per case during to per case from per case in in  the gross profit per case was 
the company hopes to improve gross margin as a percentage of sales by improving purchasing in but can make no guarantee that it will achieve this goal 
the average case price for cases sold by the company decreased from in to in  a decrease  and then to in  a decrease 
the decrease in case price between and is due to lower average prices of about for wines sold to existing customers  attributable primarily to a shift in product mix offered by the company and to more price mark downs for wines offered in the odds ends mailings from to from to  the decrease primarily resulted from increased sales to first time customers who buy wines at a lower price point 
the company does not believe that it will need to lower prices further to compete in the market place 
however  this does not preclude price adjustments that may be necessary to track price trends in the marketplace precipitated by market factors such as a drop in the price of wine from suppliers or major changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in  geerlings wade continued discounting selected products to reduce inventory and maintain a manageable number of stock keeping units 
there are several factors which cause the company s gross margins to vary 
in general  the company sells its more expensive wines at a lower gross margin percentage than its less expensive wines 
consequently  the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales diminishes if the average price point of the company s product mix increases 
the company seeks to manage its gross profit through management of the average price point of its wines and overall product mix 
however  depending on the number of factors  including the number of new customers generated by acquisition mailings and other marketing programs under development and the addition of more nationally branded wines to the product mix  the gross margin will continue to fluctuate 
on the one hand  the price point for purchases by new customers is normally under the company s average price point  therefore  increased orders by new customers lowers the average price point for the company 
on the other hand  however  nationally branded wines sold on winebins 
com and from the house mailing brochures are sold at gross margins which are significantly lower than the average gross margins for the company s privately sourced wine 
therefore  a significant sales increase in nationally branded wines will cause the company s average gross margin to decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in  or 
from to  however  selling  general and administrative expenses increased only  from  to  as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses equaled in  in and in marketing expenses  which are referred to as advertising costs in the financial statement footnotes  were the largest contributor to the increased expenses 
marketing costs increased  or  from  in to  in from to  marketing expenses increased  from  in as a percentage of sales  marketing expense was of sales in compared to of sales in in  marketing expense represented of sales 
the majority of the increase in marketing expenses resulted from spending approximately  for advertising to promote geerlings wade s internet sites  particularly in connection with the november launch of the winebins 
com site 
in  the first year the company had a website through which customers could enter order information  the company spent only  to promote its internet site 
in addition  increases in the circulation of house mailings  catalogs and acquisition mailings contributed equally to the remaining marketing expense increase for in  the company sent approximately  house mailings  including  in the second half of  to customers who had not purchased within the past two to three years 
this represented an increase of about over the  pieces mailed in also in  the company mailed approximately  brochures and odds ends mailings  an increase of about over the  pieces mailed in in  the company mailed approximately  house mailings and  brochures and odds ends mailings 
the company s decision to mail to its inactive customers in was driven both by the desire to reactivate these customers and to advertise the opportunity to purchase wine through the internet at geerwade 
com 
although responses rates to mailings to inactive customers decline as the company mails to customers who have not purchased for increasingly longer periods  the company mails to its inactive customers to the extent that the cost to reactivate them as purchasers on average equals the cost to acquire a new customer 
in this way  the company is able to optimize the return of the marketing dollars devoted to customer acquisition 
following the company s decision in the second quarter of to standardize the wines it sells in each state  the company has been able to standardize its customer mailings and anticipates that it will save significant per unit printing expenses in as a result 
the company also anticipates that its marketing expenses in connection with its e commerce sites will be significantly lower in than in the company plans to acquire new customers in through its traditional acquisition mailings 
however  in an effort to also reduce the cost of circulating the company s house mailings and catalogs  the company plans to convert as many new customers as possible to internet purchasers so that the company is able to communicate with them and the existing internet customers via e mail advertising campaigns rather than through mailings 
the company plans to further develop its catalogs devoted primarily to wine  which were first mailed in the holiday season of and delivered encouraging sales results 
in  geerlings wade plans to mail brochures  odds ends mailings and the holiday catalog to its active customers 
selling  general and administrative costs are also impacted by the company s need to comply with laws and regulations related to the retail sale of wine 
in  the company operated from licensed facilities in separate states 
operating these separate locations forces the company to incur unusually high overhead expenses as a percentage of sales 
additional lease expenses were incurred as a result of operating the michigan and texas facilities and the boston  ma retail store for their first full years and consolidating the company s san jose  california facility with passport wine s novato  california facility at a new location in petaluma  california 
in  the company also absorbed increased staffing expenses as a result of hiring personnel to develop and operate geerlings wade s e commerce sites  staffing the new texas facility  hiring additional call center personnel to deal with increased sales  particularly during the fourth quarter  and devoting personnel to oversee and facilitate the integration of the company s new computerized order management system 
increased delivery expenses in also contributed to the growth in the selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  ups notified the company that it would no longer be able to deliver packages containing alcoholic beverages in the states of connecticut  florida and nevada 
as a result  the company uses non ups couriers in each of these states and in texas  which is also outside of ups s delivery area for packages containing alcoholic beverages 
in  the company plans to devote considerable efforts to an attempt to lower delivery expenses 
merger related expenses 
geerlings wade entered into a merger agreement the merger agreement with liquid holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  liquid acquisition corp  in september  pursuant to which liquid holdings agreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of the company for per share 
the merger agreement  however  terminated pursuant to its terms in february because the financing needed by liquid holdings was not obtained 
at the time of the merger agreement  liquid holdings paid the company a  fee which was refundable under certain limited circumstances 
under the terms of the merger agreement  this fee could be used by the company for general corporate purposes 
upon the termination of the merger agreement in february  the company recorded the  fee as other income in the first quarter of interest income expense 
in  the company incurred no interest expense since it did not draw on its line of credit with bankboston  na which terminated in july 
in  the company s interest expense was  and in the company s interest expense was  interest income in increased by  to  from  in interest income in was  the net effect is that geerlings wade had net interest income of  in and  in and net interest expense of  in therefore  a higher average cash balance was available in for investing

the company increased inventory levels in in order to stock the additional wines offered through the company s new website  winebins 
com  in the brochures  through the passport wine club and in the wine catalogs  and expects to maintain these higher inventory levels in the future 
in addition  as a result of the alcoholic beverage regulatory framework within which the company operates  the company is required to maintain separate inventories in each of the markets in which it operates a licensed facility and is not permitted to transfer inventory between such facilities 
in the second quarter of  the company plans to open a licensed facility in greensboro  north carolina 
the inventory for this facility will add to the overall inventory levels 
inventory levels will fluctuate with seasonal demand and overall sales growth

while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  in the event that it should be determined that the company is not in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations  the company could become subject to cease and desist orders  injunctive proceedings  civil fines  license revocations and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
in addition  the alcoholic beverage industry is subject to potential legislation and regulation on a continuous basis including in such areas as direct and internet sales of alcohol 
there can be no assurance that new or revised laws or regulations  increased licensing fees  specialized taxes or other regulatory requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
while to date the company has been able to obtain and retain licenses necessary to sell wine at retail  the failure to obtain renewals or otherwise retain such licenses in one or more of the states in which the company operates would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
the company s growth strategy includes expansion of its business into additional states  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining licenses in any additional states 
in addition  geerlings wade offers its customers the opportunity to purchase one and three year memberships 
this membership program has from time to time generated regulatory scrutiny  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue its membership program in its current form in existing markets or that markets in which the company may become licensed in the future will allow the sale of memberships  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
limited operating history  management of growth 
geerlings wade has a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its performance 
although the company was profitable in and  the company was not profitable in  and and there can be no assurance that it will operate profitably in the future 
in addition  the company has only limited management  operational and financial resources to accommodate continued growth  should it occur 
the company s ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to hire and train new employees 
these demands are expected to require additional management resources and the development of additional expertise by existing management 
the failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that geerlings wade will be able successfully to attract and retain the skilled and experienced personnel required to manage its business 
effectiveness and cost of mailings  cost of paper 
the company targets potential new customers and solicits orders from existing customers through direct mail marketing campaigns 
direct mail marketing campaigns are capital intensive and the cost effectiveness of such campaigns depends  to a large extent  upon the accuracy of assumptions and judgments made by the company 
there can be no assurance that such direct marketing campaigns will be completed on a cost effective basis 
the failure of any such marketing campaign to identify new customers or to generate new purchases from existing customers on a cost effective basis may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
increases in the cost of paper or printing could have a negative impact on the company s business and results of operations to the extent that the company is unable to pass on such increases directly to customers 
the company relies on the services of outside vendors to prepare and distribute its mailings in accordance with company specifications and schedules 
the failure of such outside vendors to perform such services according to company specifications or to adhere to company mailing schedules may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
increases in postage rates  dependence on shippers 
the company s marketing efforts have traditionally been conducted through direct mail campaigns 
as a result  increases in postage rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
except in massachusetts and new jersey  the company is dependent upon delivery services provided by ups or other licensed delivery companies

to a large extent  the company s success depends upon its wine selection and sourcing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consistently develop a selection of wines that will enable the company to maintain or expand its customer base 
many of the company s wines are sourced by mr 
peter van hoof  one of the company s primary negociants for europe  and mr 
guy davis  one of the company s primary negociants for the us the loss of services of either of these parties could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations

dependence on consumer spending  geographic concentration of customers 
the success of geerlings wade depends upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending  including the general state of the economy  federal and state tax rates and consumer confidence 
changes in consumer spending in both the national and regional economies can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that consumers are willing to purchase 
competition  changes in consumer tastes 
the company competes with a broad range of wine specialty stores  retail liquor stores  online wine retailers  other direct mail wine merchants and certain supermarket stores  many of which may have significantly greater resources than the company 
additionally  the company s wines compete with other alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete with its current or future competition 
although consumption of premium wines in the united states has increased  there can be no assurance that changes in consumer preferences or tastes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
health issues 
since  federal law has required health warning labels on all alcoholic beverages 
although an increasing number of research studies suggest that health benefits may result from the moderate consumption of wine  these suggestions have been widely challenged and a number of groups advocate increased governmental action to restrict consumption of alcoholic beverages 
restrictions on the sale and consumption of wine or increases in the taxes imposed on wine in response to concerns regarding health issues may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that there will not be legal or regulatory challenges to the industry as a whole  and any such legal or regulatory challenge may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

from time to time  the company engages in currency hedging activities related to firm commitments for the purchase of inventories in an effort to fix costs and manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in exchange rates or currency fluctuations that disfavor the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

increases in duty or tariff levels may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
agricultural conditions  grape supply

various diseases and pests  drought  frosts and certain other weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on the quality and quantity of grapes available to producers  thereby having a material adverse effect on the cost of domestic or imported wines available to the company and on the prices of wine established by the company s competition 
dependence on computers 
the company relies on software  hardware  the internet and telecommunications equipment and services to transact  process  record  keep  analyze and manage all aspects of its business
