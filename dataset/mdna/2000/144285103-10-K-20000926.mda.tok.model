item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion of operations overview fiscal was a year of partial recovery from the cyclical downturn which occurred in fiscal while demand for most products recovered strongly  profitability was impacted by a surge in nickel costs and selling price erosion due to foreign imports and weakness in the euro 
carpenter was able to partially mitigate these negatives through cost reduction efforts  a higher operating level and several non operating gains 
net sales and earnings trends for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions  except per share data net sales net income diluted earnings per share the chart below shows net sales by major material group for the past three fiscal years in millions sales sales sales stainless steel special alloys titanium products ceramics and other materials tool and other steel total excludes a special charge of million after taxes or 
per diluted share for a salaried work force reduction and a reconfiguration of carpenter s us distribution network see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  million in fiscal  a percent increase from those of fiscal improved unit volume raised net sales by approximately million 
demand was higher for most of carpenter s products except for those used in aerospace applications  a market where customer inventory corrections took place for most of the past year until recovery began in the fourth quarter 
unit selling prices decreased by an average of percent  equivalent to million in sales  even though raw material surcharges were implemented to recover cost increases 
increased imports  weaker demand for titanium products and a decline in the value of the euro were the key factors in the price erosion 
sales outside of the us improved by percent to million as compared to fiscal most of the sales increase came from the mexico  canada and asia pacific regions 
in europe  which accounted for approximately one half of all sales outside the united states  sales were about the same as fiscal because of the increased competition caused by the weaker euro 
details of sales by geographical region for the past three fiscal years are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales were percent in fiscal and higher sales and production levels  manufacturing cost reductions and higher pension credits were the key positives 
higher costs for nickel offset much of these favorable effects 
carpenter s raw material surcharge recovers cost increases approximately days after they are incurred but cost increases affect cost of sales in the month they occur because of carpenter s use of the lifo method of accounting for inventories 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million from the fiscal level 
increased freight and depreciation costs  start up costs related to the consolidation of the distribution system and development costs for carpenter s e business activities were the primary cost drivers 
increased pension credits and salaried staff reductions partially offset these cost increases 
other income expense  net was million more favorable in fiscal than in fiscal most of the improvement was due to non recurring gains in fiscal related to sales of warehouses million  adjustments to liabilities for environmental remediation and insurance claims and other matters related to the acquisition of talley industries  inc million  and insurance and investment gains million 
interest expense was million in fiscal  a million increase over the fiscal level 
increased short term debt and higher interest rates were the major causes of this cost increase 
income taxes as a percent of pre tax income effective tax rate were approximately percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal both years were favorably affected by the resolution of foreign and state tax issues related to prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the effective tax rate for each of the past three years 
business segment results segment data for fiscal have been restated see note to the consolidated financial statements 
specialty metals segment in millions increase decrease net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit excludes special charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales for this segment  which aggregates the specialty alloys operations sao and dynamet units of carpenter  were percent higher than those of fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher volume and was offset by lower selling prices and mix changes 
sales for sao rose by percent while dynamet sales were lower by percent 
most of sao s end use market sectors were improved but aerospace demand for both sao and dynamet products was at lower levels than in fiscal ebit was slightly lower than that of fiscal  excluding the special charge 
the improved unit volume shipments and cost reductions at sao were offset by the lag in recovering the significant rise in nickel costs in the sao unit and lower sales volume for dynamet 
engineered products segment in millions increase net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit the percent increase in sales resulted from improved volume at all of the engineered products business units 
demand was particularly strong for ceramic cores for land based turbine blade castings and structural ceramic parts 
this improved profit level resulted from higher sales volume  manufacturing cost efficiencies and reduced product development and administrative costs 
pension credits pension credits  related to overfunded defined benefit pension plans  were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in these credits was primarily due to the strong investment returns on the pension plan assets during fiscal that resulted in an excess of plan assets over liabilities of million at june  based upon the actuarial valuation as of june   the pension credits for fiscal will be approximately million 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  million in fiscal  a percent decrease from the record level of  million in fiscal reduced unit volume accounted for approximately million of the sales decrease 
unit selling price decreases averaged percent  accounting for million of the sales decrease 
most of these negative effects were experienced in the specialty metals segment and were partially offset by the inclusion of a full year s sales in fiscal for companies acquired during fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent a year earlier  because of lower production levels  selling price reductions and a less profitable product mix in the specialty metals segment 
reduced staffing levels  lower raw material costs and increased pension credits helped to partially offset the margin decline 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal were higher than in fiscal by million  primarily because of the impact of newly acquired companies and increases in salaries 
reductions in salaried staffing levels  lower bonus payments and improved pension credits helped to offset these effects 
other income expense  net was favorable by million as compared to fiscal this improvement was primarily related to a nonrecurring pre tax loss of million in fiscal for the sale of a joint venture in taiwan 
income taxes as a percent of pre tax income effective tax rate were approximately percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the resolution of certain prior year state tax issues was the major factor in the lower rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the effective tax rate 
business segment results segment data for and have been restated see note to the consolidated financial statements 
specialty metals segment in millions decrease net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit excludes special charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the percent decrease in net sales was due to a combination of lower unit volume and reduced selling prices  each accounting for about one half of the sales decline 
selling prices for both the specialty alloys products and dynamet titanium products were lower by percent  in part due to lower nickel  cobalt and titanium costs but also because of intense competition from imported steel 
sales to the aerospace market sector were adversely affected by inventory reductions by customers to correct for overstocked inventory positions 
sales to industrial end use markets were another area of weakness  especially in products for petrochemical  semiconductor and processing industry applications 
automotive products were down moderately as a result of a general motors strike early in fiscal and design changes 
ebit fell percent primarily because of the lower unit sales volume and selling prices 
profit margins were also affected by a less profitable product mix and a lower production level as inventories were reduced 
lower costs for raw materials  more favorable pension credits and reductions in salaried and production staffing levels helped offset the sales effects 
engineered products segment in millions increase decrease net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit the percent increase in sales was the result of including a full year s sales in fiscal for carpenter advanced ceramics  which was acquired during  and volume growth  particularly in ceramic cores for aerospace and land based turbine blade castings and in structural ceramics applications 
the percent decrease in ebit was due to several factors 
developmental costs for new metal injection molded products  start up costs for three new ceramics facilities and expanded sales  marketing and process research programs adversely impacted fiscal also  an equipment impairment loss of million was recognized in fiscal net pension credits were million in fiscal and million in fiscal management s discussion of cash flow and financial condition cash flow net cash generated from operating activities was million in fiscal this level was down from million and million in fiscal and  because of increases in working capital 
capital expenditures  including software  continued at a high level 
fiscal expenditures totaled million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the major expenditures during fiscal were for new strip facilities and a new ton forging press 
these projects completed a five year  million capital program for capacity expansion and modernization 
total capital spending is expected to be approximately million in fiscal fiscal acquisition spending totaled million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the acquisition in fiscal was for the anval group  a powder metal producer based in sweden 
fiscal acquisitions included the strip products business of telcon  ltd  in the united kingdom and a joint venture for specialty steel production and distribution in india 
the most significant acquisition in fiscal was talley industries  inc details of acquisition activities for the past three years are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal and  carpenter sold all of the businesses of the talley industries  inc  government products and services and industrial products segments except for one insignificant company  as planned at the time talley was acquired in fiscal these sales resulted in net proceeds before taxes of million in fiscal and million in fiscal additional details regarding these divestitures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total debt increased by million to million in fiscal  including debt of an acquired company 
debt as a percent of total capital debt  deferred taxes and shareholders equity increased to percent at june   from percent at the beginning of the fiscal year 
during fiscal  carpenter s borrowing capacity was increased by million 
additionally  a long term collateralized note was issued for million in connection with an equipment purchase 
details of debt and financing agreements are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  million of cash was used to acquire  treasury common shares 
the dividend payout rates on common and preferred stock were maintained at and  per share  respectively  and totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity during the past three fiscal years  carpenter maintained the ability to provide adequate cash to meet its needs through cash flow from operations  management of working capital and the flexibility to use outside sources of financing to supplement internally generated funds 
carpenter ended fiscal with current assets exceeding current liabilities by million a ratio of to 
this ratio is conservatively stated because certain inventories are valued million less than the current cost as a result of using the lifo method 
financing is available under a million revolving credit agreement with four banks 
carpenter limits the aggregate commercial paper and credit facility borrowings at any one time to a maximum of million 
as of june   million was available under the credit facility and commercial paper program 
details of financing agreements are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
carpenter believes that its present financial resources  both from internal and external resources  will be adequate to meet its foreseeable short term and long term liquidity needs 
market sensitive instruments and risk management carpenter uses derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk 
raw material cost fluctuations for the specialty metals segment are normally offset by selling price adjustments  primarily through the use of surcharge mechanisms and base price adjustments 
firm price sales contracts involve a risk of profit margin decline in the event of raw material increases 
carpenter reduces this risk on nickel and cobalt by entering into commodity forward contracts and commodity price swaps which are effective hedges of the risk 
fluctuations in foreign exchange subject carpenter to risk of losses on anticipated future cash flows from its foreign operations 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge this foreign exchange risk 
these hedging strategies are reviewed and approved by management before being implemented 
management has established policies regarding the use of derivative instruments which prohibit the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives 
market valuations are performed at least quarterly to monitor the effectiveness of carpenter s risk management programs 
the status of carpenter s financial instruments as of june  and  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming a an instantaneous percent decrease in the price of raw materials for which carpenter has commodity forward contracts and swaps  b a percent strengthening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies for which foreign exchange forward contracts existed  c a percent change in interest rates on carpenter s short term debt  and d a percent decrease in the market value of investments in corporate owned life insurance had all occurred on june  and  carpenter s results of operations  cash flow and financial position would not have been materially affected 
contingencies environmental carpenter has environmental liabilities at some of its owned operating facilities  and has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to certain superfund waste disposal sites 
additionally  carpenter has been notified that it may be a prp with respect to other superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against carpenter 
neither the exact amount of cleanup costs nor the final method of their allocation among all designated prps at these superfund sites has been determined 
carpenter accrues amounts for environmental remediation costs that represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs related to environmental remediation 
the liability recorded for environmental cleanup costs at june  was million 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible costs of remediation at carpenter owned operating facilities and the superfund sites is between million and million as of june  recoveries of expenditures are recognized as receivables when they are estimable and probable 
additional details are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
carpenter does not anticipate that its financial position will be materially affected by additional environmental remediation costs  although quarterly or annual operating results could be materially affected by future developments 
other carpenter also is defending various claims and legal actions  and is subject to contingencies that are common to its operations 
carpenter provides for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
additional details are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while it is not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters  management believes that any total ultimate liability will not have a material effect on carpenter s financial position or results of operations and cash flows
