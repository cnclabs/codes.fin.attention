item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is an independent exploration and production company that applies d seismic imaging and other advanced technologies to systematically explore and develop onshore oil and natural gas provinces in the united states 
from inception in through december   brigham acquired  square miles of d seismic data  identified approximately  potential drilling locations and drilled wells delineated by d seismic analysis 
through its d seismic based drilling efforts  the company had discovered an aggregate of bcfe of net proved reserves as of december  the company believes this performance demonstrates a systematic methodology for finding oil and natural gas in onshore domestic hydrocarbon producing provinces 
combining its geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  the company manages the majority of its projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  the company manages the negotiation and drafting of most of its geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because it generates most of its projects  the company can control the size of the working interest that it retains as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
consistent with its business strategy  brigham has increased the working interest it retained in its projects  based on capital availability and perceived risk 
the company s average working interest in its d seismic projects acquired during  and was  and  respectively  while its average working interest in its wells drilled during this period was  and  respectively 
the company did not acquire any new d seismic in  and its average working interest in its wells drilled during was 
beginning in  the company has managed operations through the drilling and production phases on an increasing portion of its d seismic projects 
brigham operated of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in as compared with of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in expenditures made in oil and natural gas exploration vary from project to project depending primarily on the costs related to seismic acquisition  land and drilling  and the working interest retained by the company 
prior to  the company s participants typically bore a disproportionate share of the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data  and the company and its participants each typically incurred leasing  drilling and completion costs in proportion to their ownership interests 
in and  brigham retained majority working interests in its new d seismic projects  and thereby reduced the financial leverage it historically received on the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data on its projects 
from inception through  the company acquired  gross net square miles of d seismic data 
initially  the company focused its efforts in west texas 
in  the company began to devote substantial attention to the anadarko basin  and since the company has devoted the majority of its resources to the anadarko basin and gulf coast 
with this shift in regional focus  the majority of the company s production volumes has shifted from oil to natural gas 
to finance these project generation and drilling activities  the company supplemented cash flow from operations with private placements of debt and equity  commercial bank credit facilities and placements of working interests in projects with industry participants 
as the company s cash flows from operations and other sources of capital have increased during this period  it retained larger average working interests in its projects 
in and  the company acquired  gross  net square miles of d seismic and continued to focus the majority of its d exploration efforts in the anadarko basin and the gulf coast 
during these two years  the company acquired  square miles of d seismic in the anadarko basin  making this basin the most active d seismic acquisition province for the company 
brigham also significantly increased its gulf coast activity  acquiring square miles of d seismic during this period 
during and  the company drilled gross net wells based on its d seismic data analysis 
in addition to its drilling activities  the company acquired net bcfe of proved reserves and an interest in undeveloped acreage the chitwood acquisition at the northern end of the carter knox anticline in grady county  oklahoma for million in november as a result of these activities  the company s net natural gas and oil production increased from bcfe in to bcfe in the company s net production volumes consisted of natural gas on an equivalent basis during the fourth quarter as compared with during the fourth quarter the company supplemented cash flow from operations in and with borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  million raised in its initial public offering of common stock in may  million raised through the placement of debt and equity securities in august and the placement of working interests in projects to industry participants to finance its project generation  property acquisition and drilling activities 
as a result of lower commodity prices and reduced access to the capital markets in late and  the company implemented a number of strategic initiatives during to improve its capital liquidity to fund its continuing exploration program in the difficult industry environment 
these objectives and results accomplished for each include o focusing all planned exploration efforts in toward drilling of highest grade d prospects in its anadarko basin and gulf coast projects 
operating under a reduced drilling budget in as compared with  brigham directed its resources toward the drilling of identified prospects within trends where it had achieved historical drilling success 
this focused drilling emphasis contributed to substantially improved returns on the company s drilling investments during  with average drilling costs of per mcfe and average all in finding costs of per mcfe for the year 
o eliminating substantially all seismic and land expenditures for new projects 
in an effort to devote the majority of its capital resources to the drilling of its identified prospect locations  brigham did not acquire any new d seismic data in in addition to executing the company s high graded drilling program  brigham s staff of explorationists continued to interpret previously acquired d seismic data within existing projects to further delineate and refine pre drill analysis of potential drilling locations 
o seeking to divest certain producing natural gas and oil properties 
in june  brigham sold interests in certain non operated properties in two project areas in its anadarko basin province for a total of million 
these properties had estimated net proved reserves of bcfe as of june   of which approximately were non producing  and were producing an estimated net mmcfe per day at the time of the sales 
after application of the net proceeds received from these sales to the repayment of a portion of its outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  brigham was able to increase its available borrowings under its bank credit facility by million 
the increase in bank borrowing capacity resulting primarily from these property sales was utilized to fund a substantial portion of the company s capital expenditures during the second half of o restructuring its senior and subordinated debt agreements 
working closely with its senior and subordinated lenders in and early  brigham was able to amend its senior credit facility and the indenture for its subordinated notes due to provide the company with increased borrowing availability and financial flexibility to preserve cash flow to fund its exploration activities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
o implementing an overhead reduction plan 
brigham implemented several initiatives during that were designed to reduce general and administrative expenses and thereby increase cash flow from operations 
these cost reduction initiatives included a company wide salary reduction effective in may  the elimination of employee bonuses for  subleasing a portion of the company s headquarters space effective in november  certain personnel reductions and the elimination or reduction of various other discretionary expenses 
as a result of these actions  brigham s total general and administrative expenses including amounts capitalized were reduced from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter  while the company s per unit net general and administrative expenses decreased from per mcfe to per mcfe during these same periods 
o raising equity capital 
during  brigham raised approximately million in capital through the sale of interests in non producing assets  primarily project and prospect equity sales to industry participants 
in addition  brigham issued million of common stock to veritas dgc land  inc veritas to satisfy payment obligations due to veritas for seismic acquisition and processing services performed prior to and certain seismic processing services performed during in connection with its series of financing transactions effected in february to fund its planned exploration and development program for  brigham raised million through the issuance of common stock and warrants in a private equity placement 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain internal costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in the amortizable base of the full cost pool as incurred 
upon the interpretation by the company of the d seismic associated with unproved properties  the geological and geophysical costs of acreage that is not specifically identified as prospective are transferred to the amortizable base of the full cost pool 
geological and geophysical costs associated with prospective acreage  as well as leasehold costs  are transferred to the amortizable base of the full cost pool when the prospects are drilled 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that the costs capitalized in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate and based on period end natural gas and oil prices of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves plus the capitalized cost of unproved properties  such costs are charged to operations as a writedown of the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties  or a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
the risk that the company will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed  even if such prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if the company experiences poor drilling results or has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a charge to earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and stockholders equity 
once incurred  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to natural gas and oil properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
primarily as a result of the significant declines in both oil and natural gas prices at december  and disappointing drilling results on several of the company s high working interest wells in  the company recorded a capitalized ceiling impairment charge at december  of million see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
see risk factors exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exploratory drilling activities  risk factors volatility of oil and gas markets affects us  oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and risk factors we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows 
in connection with the exchange of interests in the company s predecessor partnership with shares of the company s common stock the exchange prior to the company s initial public offering in  the company issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to certain of its officers and employees 
the company recorded an unearned stock compensation balance of million in the first quarter  of which approximately one half will be added to the amortizable base of the full cost pool over the vesting period of the options and the balance will be recorded as a non cash compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
as a result  the company expects to incur unearned stock compensation amortization expenses of approximately  in   in and an aggregate of  in the two years thereafter 
the company s predecessor was classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no income taxes were paid or provided for by the company prior to the exchange 
the company is a taxable entity 
in connection with the exchange on february   the company incurred a million charge to record a deferred income tax liability to recognize the differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of the company s predecessor partnership s natural gas and oil properties at the exchange date  given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
during the fourth quarter  the company elected to record a step up in the basis of its assets for tax purposes as a result of the exchange 
due to this election  the company recorded a million non cash deferred income tax benefit during the fourth quarter  which resulted in a net million per diluted share non cash deferred income tax charge for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data for the periods presented 
year ended december  production natural gas mmcf    oil mbbls natural gas equivalent mmcfe    natural gas average sales prices per unit natural gas per mcf oil per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe costs and expenses per mcfe lease operating production taxes general and administrative depletion of natural gas and oil properties reflects the effects of the company s hedging activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters hedging activities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
natural gas and oil sales increased from million in to million in an increase in the average sales price received for natural gas and oil sales accounted for million of this increase and was offset by  from a decrease in net production volumes 
production volumes for natural gas decreased from  mmcf in to  mmcf in  while the average price received for natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf in production volumes for oil decreased from mbbls in to mbbls in  while the average price received for oil increased from per bbl in to per bbl in natural gas and oil sales in were increased by higher realized natural gas and oil prices and production from wells completed during  offset partially by the natural decline of existing production and from the sale of certain producing wells in the company s mid property divestitures 
see overview 
as a result of hedging activities  natural gas revenues were reduced by  per mcf in  compared to an increase in natural gas revenues of  per mcf in see other matters hedging activities 
workstation revenue 
workstation revenue decreased from  in to  in brigham recognizes workstation revenue as industry participants in its seismic programs are charged an hourly rate for the work performed by the company on its d seismic interpretation workstations 
this decrease in is primarily attributable to the company s increased working interests in its d seismic projects in and  which reduces the amount of workstation interpretation costs billable to the company s project participants 
brigham expects workstation revenue to continue to decline in due to the company s increased working interests in the square miles of d seismic it acquired in and lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily due to higher average working interests in its producing wells and increased well repair and workover activity in as compared with  offset in part by the elimination of lease operating expenses related to wells sold by the company in its mid property divestitures 
see overview 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to  per mcfe in primarily due to higher average natural gas and oil sales prices and revenues 
the effective average production tax rate increased from of natural gas and oil sales revenues in to in resulting from changes in the geographic distribution of the company s producing wells 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this decrease was primarily attributable to a series of cost reduction initiatives implemented by brigham during to reduce overhead expense levels 
these initiatives included a company wide salary reduction effective in may  the elimination of employee bonuses for  a sublease of a portion of the company s headquarters space effective in november  certain personnel reductions and the elimination or reduction of various other discretionary expenses 
the company plans to continue certain of these cost reduction initiatives in an effort to further reduce net general and administrative expenses per unit in depletion of natural gas and oil properties 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in of this decrease   was attributable to the lower production volumes during the period and  was due to the reduction in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the decrease in depletion rate per unit of production was primarily the result of the addition of natural gas and oil reserves at lower average capital costs due to improved average finding costs during  partially offset by an increase in the percentage of the company s total full cost pool subject to depletion attributable to an increase in the estimate of the evaluated portion of the company s natural gas and oil properties 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher outstanding debt balances in at higher effective interest rates 
the company s weighted average outstanding debt balance increased from million in to million in this increase in debt was incurred primarily to fund the company s increased capital expenditures and working capital needs  net of operating cash flow  during and the effective annual interest rate on the company s outstanding indebtedness increased from in to in  primarily due to the company s issuance of million of senior subordinated secured notes due the subordinated notes in august  which bore interest at an annual rate of when paid in cash and when paid in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes 
in addition  interest expense in included i million of interest expenses related to the subordinated notes that was paid in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash  and ii million of non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred loan fees and the amortization of discount on the subordinated notes 
pursuant to the recently amended terms of the company s senior credit facility and the subordinated notes  brigham expects to pay its interest obligations related to the subordinated notes through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash during the first three quarters of and potentially during the fourth quarter  if certain conditions are met in an effort to preserve cash flow to fund capital expenditures 
borrowings under the company s credit facility had an effective annual interest rate of at december  see liquidity and capital resources 
loss on sale of natural gas and oil properties 
in june  the company sold all of its interests in certain producing and non producing natural gas and oil properties for a total sales price of million 
due to the magnitude of the reserve volumes that were attributable to these properties relative to the company s remaining net reserve volumes  the company recognized a million non cash loss to reflect the difference between the sales price received after adjustment for transaction costs and the million basis allocated to the divested properties in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
no property divestitures occurred during for which recognition of gain or loss was appropriate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
natural gas and oil sales increased from million in to million in production volume increases accounted for million of this increase and were offset by million from a decrease in the average sales price received for natural gas and oil sales 
production volumes for natural gas increased from  mmcf in to  mmcf in the average price received for natural gas decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in production volumes for oil increased from mbbls in to mbbls in the average price received for oil decreased from per bbl in to per bbl in natural gas and oil sales in were increased by production from wells completed and flowing to sales since december   offset partially by the natural decline of existing production  and from certain wells acquired in the chitwood acquisition which were included in the company s results of operations effective september  see overview 
as a result of hedging activities  natural gas revenues increased by  per mcf in  compared to a decrease in oil revenues of  per bbl in see other matters hedging activities 
workstation revenue 
workstation revenue decreased from  in to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to the company s increased working interests in its recently acquired d seismic data  which reduced the amount of workstation interpretation costs billable to the company s project participants 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of producing wells during from those in the decrease in the per unit amount was primarily due to an increase in natural gas production as a percentage of total equivalent production in and in since a typical natural gas well produces with lower average lease operating costs per unit of production than a typical oil well 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to  per mcfe in as a direct result of increased production volumes 
the effective average production tax rate increased from of natural gas and oil sales revenues in to in due to the increase in natural gas production as a percentage of total equivalent production as natural gas is typically burdened with higher production tax rates than oil 
the decrease in the per unit amount was primarily attributable to the decline in natural gas and oil sales prices in as compared with general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses necessary to manage the company s growing operations 
the decrease in the per unit rate was a result of a greater increase in natural gas and oil production volumes than general and administrative expenses from to due to the aforementioned factors 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in production volumes during the period and million was due to the increase in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the increase in depletion rate per unit of production was primarily the result of the addition of natural gas and oil reserves at higher average capital costs due to a reduction in drilling performance and downward revisions to previous reserve estimates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher outstanding debt balances in at higher effective interest rates 
the company s weighted average outstanding debt balance increased from million in to million in this increase in debt was incurred primarily to fund the company s increased capital expenditures and working capital needs  net of operating cash flow  during the effective annual interest rate on the company s outstanding indebtedness increased from in to in  primarily due to the company s issuance of subordinated notes in august in addition  interest expense in included i approximately million of non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred loan fees and the amortization of discount on the subordinated notes  and ii  of interest expenses related to the subordinated notes that was paid in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash in february borrowings under the company s senior credit facility had an effective annual interest rate of at december  liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital have been credit facility and other debt borrowings  public and private equity financings  the sale of interests in projects and properties and funds generated by operations 
the company s primary capital requirements are d seismic acquisition  processing and interpretation costs  land acquisition costs and drilling expenditures 
in january  the company entered into a new bank credit facility that provided for borrowing availability of million that was used to repay its then outstanding borrowings under its previous credit facility and to fund capital expenditures 
this credit facility has been subsequently amended  including i an amendment in july in connection with the company s mid sales of natural gas and oil properties to provide for borrowing availability of million  and ii an amendment in february to provide for borrowing availability of million that would be increased to million under certain circumstances 
in august  the company issued million of debt and equity securities  including the million of subordinated notes  that generated proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs  that were used to repay a portion of then outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility  thereby increasing the company s borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund capital expenditures 
during  brigham issued million of common stock to veritas dgc land  inc  to satisfy payment obligations due to veritas for seismic acquisition and processing services 
in june  the company received million million after transaction costs and post closing adjustments from the sale of its interests in producing and non producing natural gas and oil properties located in two non operated fields in its anadarko basin province 
in february  brigham raised million through the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in a private equity placement to three institutional investors 
credit facility in january  the company entered into a revolving credit agreement the credit facility  which provided for an initial borrowing availability of million 
the credit facility was amended in march to reduce the borrowing availability  extend the date of borrowing base redetermination  modify certain financial covenants  include certain additional covenants that place significant restrictions on the company s ability to incur certain capital expenditures  and to increase the interest rate on outstanding borrowings 
as a result of the completion of the majority of the company s strategic initiatives to improve its capital resources  including the june property divestitures and the application of the net sales proceeds to reduce borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  the company and its senior lenders entered into an amendment to the credit facility in july this amendment provided the company with borrowing availability of million principally to fund its planned drilling activities and anticipated working capital requirements through the end of as consideration for this amendment to the credit facility  in july the company issued to its senior lenders one million warrants to purchase the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a seven year term from the date of issuance and are exercisable at the holders option at any time 
an estimated value of million was attributed to these warrants by the company and was recognized as additional deferred loan fees that will be amortized over the remaining period to maturity of the credit facility 
in february  brigham entered into an amended and restated credit facility with its existing lenders and a new lender 
this amended and restated credit facility provides the company with million in borrowing availability for a three year term  an increase from the million previously available 
if brigham exceeds certain asset value and interest coverage tests in the second or third quarters of  the total borrowing availability under the credit facility will increase to million 
the company s lenders have indicated that the borrowing availability provided under the amended credit facility exceeded that which would otherwise have been made available under a more traditional conforming borrowing base calculation based on the estimated value of the company s current net proved reserves and its cash flow 
borrowings under the credit facility in excess of million are convertible into shares of brigham common stock in the following amounts i the first million of borrowings is convertible at per share  ii the second million is convertible at per share and iii the final million is convertible at per share 
if the credit facility is repaid at maturity or is prepaid prior to maturity without payment of cash premiums  the warrants issued to the new lender of the credit facility to purchase brigham common stock become exercisable 
in addition  certain financial covenants of the credit facility have been amended or added 
in connection with this most recent amendment  the company reset the price of the warrants previously issued to its existing senior lenders to purchase one million shares of brigham common stock from the then current exercise price of per share to per share 
principal outstanding under the credit facility is due at maturity on december   with interest due monthly for base rate tranches or periodically as libor tranches mature 
the annual interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility is either the lender s base rate or libor plus  at the company s option 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the natural gas and oil properties and other tangible assets of the company 
at march   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  which bear interest at an annual rate of approximately 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility has certain financial covenants  including current and interest coverage ratios  as defined 
the company and its lenders effected the amendments to the credit facility in march  july and february  in part  to enable the company to comply with certain financial covenants of the credit facility  including the minimum current ratio as defined  minimum interest coverage ratio as defined and the limitation on capital expenditures related to seismic and land activities 
should the company be unable to comply with certain of the financial or other covenants  its senior lenders may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on the company s future financial position and results of operations 
subordinated notes in august  the company issued million of debt and equity securities to affiliates of enron corp 
securities issued by the company in connection with this financing transaction included i million of subordinated notes  ii warrants to purchase one million shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share the subordinated note warrants  and iii  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the approximate million in net proceeds received by the company from this financing transaction were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility  which at the time increased the company s borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund capital expenditures 
principal outstanding under the subordinated notes is due at maturity on august  interest on the subordinated notes is payable quarterly at rates that vary depending upon whether accrued interest is paid in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes 
interest is payable in cash at interest rates of  and per annum during years one through three  year four and year five  respectively  of the term of the subordinated notes  provided  however  that the company may pay interest in kind for a cumulative total of seven quarterly interest payments potentially increasing to eight if certain conditions are met at interest rates of  and per annum during years one through three  year four and year five  respectively  of the term of the subordinated notes 
as of march   the company had made a cumulative total of five quarterly interest payments in kind and expects to make at least the next two quarterly interest payments due may and august in kind 
the subordinated notes rank subordinate in right of payment to senior indebtedness as defined and senior to all other financings other than any allowed capital leases and purchase money financings of the company 
the subordinated notes are secured by a second lien against substantially all of the natural gas and oil properties and other tangible assets of the company 
the subordinated notes may be prepaid at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  provided that all partial prepayments must be pro rata to the various holders of the subordinated notes 
the subordinated notes were issued pursuant to an indenture the indenture that contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make distributions  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  dispose of certain assets  incur liens  reborrow funds utilized to prepay the senior indebtedness and engage in most types of mergers and consolidations 
in march  the company and chase bank of texas  national association  as trustee the trustee for the holders of the subordinated notes  entered into an amendment to the indenture 
this amendment provided the company with the option to pay interest due on the subordinated notes in kind  for any reason  through the second quarter of in addition  certain financial and other covenants were amended 
the amendment also provided for a reduction in the exercise price per share of the subordinated note warrants from per share to per share and extended the term of the subordinated note warrants from seven to ten years 
in february  brigham entered into another amendment to the terms of the indenture 
in this amendment  the holders of the subordinated notes agreed to waive the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant through june  and to adjust subsequent levels under this test 
in addition  the amendment provides the company with an extension of its right to pay interest in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash through the third quarter of and potentially through the fourth quarter of if certain conditions are met 
in exchange for granting these amendments  the company has i reset the price of the subordinated note warrants from a then current exercise price of per share to per share  and ii granted to the holders of the subordinated notes a term overriding royalty interest that provides for the limited right to receive  or if certain conditions are met  of the company s net production revenue to reduce any outstanding subordinated notes issued as interest paid in kind 
the indenture governing the subordinated notes has certain financial covenants  including current and interest coverage ratios  as defined 
the company and the holders of the subordinated notes effected the march and february amendments to the indenture to enable the company to comply with certain financial covenants of the indenture  including the minimum current ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio  as defined 
should the company be unable to comply with certain of the financial covenants  the holders of the subordinated notes may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on the company s future financial position and results of operations 
at december  and march   the company had million and million  respectively  principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding 
sales of interests in projects and natural gas and oil properties duke project financing 
in february  the company entered into a project financing arrangement with duke energy financial services  inc duke to fund the continued exploration of five anadarko basin projects covered by approximately square miles of d seismic data acquired in in this transaction  the company conveyed of its working interest land and seismic in these project areas to a newly formed limited liability company the duke llc for total consideration of million 
the company is the managing member of the duke llc with a interest  and duke is the sole remaining member with a interest 
pursuant to the terms of the duke llc agreement  brigham pays of the drilling and completion costs for all wells drilled by the duke llc within the designated project areas in exchange for a working interest in the wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units  with the remaining working interest remaining in the duke llc  subject in each instance to proportionate reduction by any ownership rights held by third parties 
upon project payout  the company has the right to back in for of the duke llc s working interest in all of the then producing wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units and a working interest in any wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units drilled after payout within the designated project areas governed by the duke llc agreement  thereby increasing the company s effective working interest in the duke llc wells from to 
the company believes this project financing arrangement to be beneficial as it enabled brigham to recoup substantially all of its pre seismic land and seismic data acquisition costs incurred in these project areas and provided capital to fund the drilling of the first six wells within these projects 
mid property sales 
in june  brigham sold certain producing and non producing natural gas and oil properties located in its anadarko basin province to two separate parties for a total of million 
the divested properties were located in two fields operated by third parties the chitwood field in grady county  oklahoma originally acquired by the company for million in the chitwood acquisition in november  and the red deer creek field in roberts county  texas 
brigham s independent reservoir engineers estimated net proved reserve volumes attributable to the properties as of june  of approximately bcfe  of which were classified as proved developed producing reserves and were natural gas 
the company estimated that net production volumes from the divested properties were mmcfe per day at the time of the sales 
the company used the proceeds from these transactions to reduce borrowings under its credit facility  which contributed to provide the company with million in borrowing availability under its then existing credit facility that was used to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures during the second half of the effective date of each transaction was june equity placements veritas equity issuances 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with veritas dgc land  inc to exchange  shares of newly issued brigham common stock valued at per share for approximately million of payment obligations due to veritas in for certain seismic acquisition and processing services previously performed 
in addition  this agreement provided for the payment by brigham of up to million in future seismic processing services to be performed by veritas in newly issued shares of brigham common stock valued at per share  in the event that the company did not elect to pay for such services in cash 
the settlement of these future seismic processing services was determined on a quarterly basis through september  pursuant to this agreement  brigham issued a total of  shares of common stock to veritas to satisfy million in aggregate payment obligations due to veritas for seismic acquisition and processing services performed prior to and certain seismic processing services performed during private equity placement 
on february   brigham entered into an agreement to issue  shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase common stock for total consideration of million in a private placement to a group of institutional investors led by affiliates of two members of the company s board of directors 
the equity sale consisted of units that include one share of common stock priced at per share and one third of a warrant to purchase brigham common stock at an exercise price of per share with a three year term 
pricing of this private equity placement was based on the average market price of brigham common stock during a twenty trading day period prior to issuance 
net proceeds from this equity placement will be used to fund a portion of the company s planned capital expenditures and working capital obligations 
cash flow analysis cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  million in and million in the decrease in cash flows for compared to was primarily attributable to changes in working capital a million reduction in cash flow from working capital items in compared to an million increase in cash flow from working capital items in 
the increase in cash flows for compared to was due primarily to an increase in natural gas and oil revenues  net of lease operating expenses  production taxes and general and administrative expenses  and net changes in working capital items 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows provided by investing activities in were million as compared to cash flows used by investing activities of million in and million in the increase in net cash flow from investing activities in was due to the combined effects of significantly reduced net capital expenditures and a total of million of proceeds received from the sales of natural gas and oil properties  which consisted principally of the company s mid producing property divestitures and its sales of promoted interests in certain d seismic projects and drilling prospects in its anadarko basin and gulf coast regions 
the decrease in cash flow from investing activities in were the direct result of an increase in capital expenditures related to the company s exploration and development activities 
capital expenditures before the application of net proceeds received from the sales of interests in projects were million in  million in and million in after acquiring  gross net square miles of d seismic in and  gross net square miles of d seismic in  the company did not acquire any new d seismic data during the company s drilling efforts during the past three years resulted in the completion of net wells in  net wells in  and net wells in  which contributed to aggregate net increases in proved reserve volumes net of revisions to previous estimates of bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in in addition  the company sold interests in certain producing and non producing properties in for a total of million  and it acquired certain producing properties and related interests for million in and million in cash flows from financing activities

capital expenditures continuing its strategy implemented during  brigham intends to focus substantially all of its efforts and available capital resources in to the drilling and monetization of its highest grade prospects within its over  square mile inventory of d seismic data 
the company s current capital expenditure budget is estimated to be million  which includes approximately million for drilling projects and million for non drilling activities primarily acreage acquisition and capitalized overhead costs 
brigham s planned drilling program consists of a balanced blend of exploration and development drilling projects with approximately of budgeted drilling expenditures targeted for exploratory prospects  for development locations and the remaining for development locations that are contingent upon drilling success during the year 
in addition  the company s budgeted drilling expenditures have been allocated approximately to its gulf coast province and to its anadarko basin province  concentrated within trends where the company has experienced exploration success to date 
the company intends to fund these budgeted capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations  available borrowings under its senior credit facility and the proceeds from its february private equity placement 
additionally  the company intends to supplement its available capital resources through selective sales of interests in non producing assets  including interests in its d seismic projects and promoted interests in future drilling prospects or locations 
see item properties primary exploration provinces 
due to the company s active exploration and development activities  brigham has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
while the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility should allow the company to finance its planned operations through based on current conditions and expectations  additional financing will be required in the future to fund the company s exploration and development activities 
in the event additional financing is not available  the company may be required to curtail or delay its planned activities 
other matters hedging activities the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to reduce its exposure to natural gas and oil sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
the company expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in  brigham began using natural gas swap arrangements in an attempt to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices as its production base became increasingly weighted toward natural gas 
pursuant to these arrangements the company exchanges a floating market price for a fixed contract price 
payments are made by the company when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month and payments are received by the company when the fixed price exceeds the floating price 
settlements of these swaps are based on the difference between regional market index prices for a contract month and the fixed contract price for the same month 
total natural gas purchased and sold subject to swap arrangements entered into by the company was  mmbtu in and  mmbtu in the company accounted for substantially all of these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  adjusted the price received for natural gas and oil production during the period the hedged transactions occurred 
adjustments to the price received for natural gas under these swap arrangements resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of  in and a decrease in natural gas revenues of  in in september  brigham sold call options on a portion of its future oil and natural gas production 
the company applied the proceeds from the sale of these call options to increase the effective fixed swap price on its then existing natural gas hedging contracts during the months of october through january by an average of per mmbtu 
for accounting purposes  the improvement in the company s fixed natural gas swap price attributable to these transactions is not reflected in reported revenues 
rather  it is reflected in i other income expense on the income statement  and ii amortization of deferred loss on derivatives instruments and market value adjustment for derivatives instruments on the cash flow statement

if the price of oil and gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in revenues as well as the operating costs that the company is required to bear for operations 
inflation has had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and marketing of natural gas and oil  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity

although the company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected effects on its business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are general economic conditions  inherent uncertainties in interpreting engineering data  operating hazards  delays or cancellations of drilling operations for a variety of reasons  competition  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  availability of sufficient capital resources to the company and its project participants  government regulations and other factors set forth among the risk factors noted below or in the description of the company s business in item of this report

risk factors we are substantially leveraged our outstanding long term debt was million principal amount as of december  the indenture governing our senior subordinated secured notes limits the amounts of additional debt borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit facility or other senior indebtedness 
however  the indenture permits us to borrow under our senior credit facility up to the lesser of million or the loan commitments under the facility million as of march  
we had million of borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility as of march  our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our operations  including those listed below 
o we will dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and will not have these cash flows available for other purposes 
o the covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
we may also be required to alter our capitalization significantly to accommodate future exploration  development or acquisition activities 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter our leverage and dilute the equity interests of existing stockholders 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our future performance will not be harmed by such economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we have substantial capital requirements we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
while we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility should allow us to finance our planned operations through based on current conditions and expectations  additional financing will be required in the future to fund our exploration and development activities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing on reasonable terms or at all  or that financing will continue to be available to us under our existing or new financing arrangements 
without additional capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
see liquidity and capital resources 
volatility of oil and gas markets affects us  oil and natural gas prices are volatile our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
market prices of oil and natural gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including o worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  o the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  o political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  o the price and level of foreign imports  o the level of consumer demand  o the price and availability of alternative fuels  o the availability of pipeline capacity  o weather conditions  o domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and o the overall economic environment 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
during  the high and low prices for oil on the nymex were per bbl and per bbl  and the high and low prices for natural gas on the nymex were per mmbtu and per mmbtu 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business o limit our financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations  o reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  o cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects  o reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flow  and o reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
our hedging transactions may not prevent losses in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to energy price volatility  we use swap and collar hedging arrangements that generally result in a fixed price or a range of minimum and maximum price limits over a specified monthly time period 
if we do not produce our oil and natural gas reserves at rates equivalent to our hedged position  we would be required to satisfy our obligations under hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of our own production 
because the terms of our hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation and marketing costs to delivery points  substantial differences between the hedged prices and actual results could harm our anticipated profit margins and our ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
hedging contracts limit the benefits we will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
we could be financially harmed if the other party to the hedging contracts proves unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exploratory drilling activities our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the success of our exploratory drilling program 
exploratory drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs 
we cannot always predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including o unexpected drilling conditions  o pressure or irregularities in formations  o equipment failures or accidents  o adverse weather conditions  o compliance with governmental requirements  and o shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
we may not be successful in our future drilling activities because even with the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies  exploratory drilling is a speculative activity 
we could incur losses because our use of d seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
even when fully utilized and properly interpreted  our d seismic data and other advanced technologies only assist us in identifying subsurface structures and do not indicate whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures 
because we interpret the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data gathered over large areas  we may not acquire option and lease rights until after the seismic data is available and  in some cases  until the drilling locations are also identified 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we cannot assure you that we will ever lease  drill or produce oil or natural gas oil from these or any other potential drilling locations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our drilling activities  that our overall drilling success rate for activity within a particular province will not decline  or that our completed wells will ultimately produce our estimated economically recoverable reserves 
unsuccessful drilling activities could materially harm our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various casualty risks our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as o fires  o natural disasters  o formations with abnormal pressures  o blowouts  cratering and explosions  and o pipeline ruptures and spills 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
see item business operating hazards and uninsured risks 
we may not have enough insurance to cover some operating risks we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against operating hazards 
we may elect to self insure if our management believes that the cost of insurance  although available  is excessive relative to the risks presented 
we generally maintain insurance for the hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas and believe this insurance is adequate 
if an event occurs that is not covered  or not fully covered  by insurance  it could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks 
the marketability of our production is dependent on facilities that we typically do not own or control the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own 
our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas could be harmed by any dramatic change in market factors or by o federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  o tax and energy policies  o changes in supply and demand  and o general economic conditions 
we have historical operating losses and our future results may vary  we have incurred net losses in each year of operation we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and total stockholders equity of million 
we have recognized the following annual net losses since million in   in  million including a net million non cash deferred income tax charge incurred in connection with our conversion from a partnership to a corporation in  million including a million non cash writedown in the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties in  and million including a million non cash loss on the sale of natural gas and oil properties in see item selected financial data 
our future operating results may fluctuate our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including o industry conditions  o prices of oil and natural gas  o rates of drilling success  o capital availability  o rates of production from completed wells  and o the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
this variability could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  any failure or delay in the realization of expected cash flows from operating activities could limit our ability to invest and participate in economically attractive projects 
maintaining reserves and revenues in the future depends on successful exploration and development in general  production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future oil and natural gas production depends highly upon our ability to economically find  develop or acquire reserves in commercial quantities 
the business of exploring for or developing reserves is capital intensive 
reductions in our cash flow from operations and limitations on or unavailability of external sources of capital may impair our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our future exploration and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
furthermore  although significant increases in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas could cause increases in our revenues  our finding and development costs could also increase 
finally  we participate in a percentage of our wells as a non operator 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could harm us 
we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows there is substantial uncertainty in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way 
accordingly  oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimations of those accumulations 
estimates of other engineers might differ widely from those of our independent petroleum engineers 
accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
our independent petroleum engineers may make material changes to reserve estimates based on the results of actual drilling  testing  and production 
as a result  our reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas we ultimately recover 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows 
see item properties natural gas and oil reserves 
actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as o the amount and timing of actual production  o supply and demand for oil and natural gas  o limits or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  and o changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the sec reporting requirements may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
we face significant competition we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production with other companies 
we face intense competition from a large number of independent  technology driven companies as well as both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as o seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  o marketing our oil and natural gas production  and o seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop those properties 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
this highly competitive environment could harm our business 
see item business competition 
we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and marketing of  oil and natural gas  as well as safety matters 
although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
our operations are subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations change frequently  and the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could harm us 
the discharge of natural gas  oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation 
we cannot be certain that existing environmental laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations will not harm our results of operations and financial condition

accordingly  these stockholders  as a group  will be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect our management or direction 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or voting control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments the company limits its use of derivative instruments principally to commodity price hedging activities  whereby gains and losses are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
as a result  management believes that its use of derivative instruments does not expose the company to material risk 
the company s use of derivative instruments for hedging activities could materially affect the company s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods since such instruments can limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable oil and natural gas price movements 
however  management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
commodity price risk the company s primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the prices related to the sale of its oil and natural gas production 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
as such  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the sales prices it receives for its oil and natural gas production through hedging activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters hedging activities 
the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to reduce its exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
the company expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time 
based on the company s oil and natural gas hedging arrangements outstanding at march   an adverse change defined as a hypothetical and increase in underlying commodity prices for open positions would reduce cash flow by approximately million and million  respectively  from currently projected levels 
additionally  as the company utilizes swap and collar arrangements to hedge anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
the impact of these price changes is not reflected in this sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk as borrowings under its senior credit facility million outstanding as of march  accrue interest at floating rates based on the lender s base rate or libor 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments to protect against changes in interest rates on debt borrowings
