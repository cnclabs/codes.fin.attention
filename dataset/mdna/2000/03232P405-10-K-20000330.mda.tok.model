overview the company develops  acquires and operates practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   the company owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers and had established eight specialty physician networks  of which it was the majority owner of seven of such networks 
the company operated as a majority owned subsidiary of american healthways  inc ahi  formerly known as american healthcorp  inc  from until december  when ahi distributed to its stockholders all of its holdings in amsurg common stock the distribution 
prior to the distribution  the company effected a recapitalization pursuant to which every three shares of the company s then outstanding common stock were converted into one share of class a common stock 
immediately following the recapitalization  ahi exchanged a portion of its shares of class a common stock for shares of class b common stock 
the principal purpose of the distribution was to enable the company to have access to debt and equity capital markets as an independent  publicly traded company 
upon the distribution  the company became a publicly traded company 
the following table presents the components of changes in the number of surgery centers in operation and centers under development for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of year 
new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers sold centers in operation  end of year centers under development  end of year the specialty physician networks are owned through limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which the company generally owns a majority interest 
the other partners or members are individual physicians who will provide the medical services to the patient population covered by the contracts the network enters into with managed care payers 
the company does not expect that the specialty physician networks alone will be a significant source of income 
these networks were and will be formed in selected markets primarily as a contracting vehicle for certain managed care arrangements to generate revenues for the company s practice based surgery centers 
as of december   five networks had secured managed care contracts and were operational 
the company intends to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties 
in addition  the company believes that its surgery centers  combined with its relationships with specialty physician practices in the surgery centers markets  will provide the company with other opportunities for growth from specialty network development 
by using its surgery centers as a base to develop specialty physician networks that are designed to serve large numbers of covered lives  the company believes that it will strengthen its market position in contracting with managed care organizations 
on january   the company signed a definitive agreement with prg for the purchase of a portion of prg s ownership interest in single specialty ophthalmology ambulatory surgery centers for approximately million in cash 
in addition  amsurg may purchase additional centers from prg upon completion of satisfactory due diligence 
as a part of this agreement  the company began managing these centers and an additional four centers the company may purchase upon completion of negotiations with prg 
prg has filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
consummation of this transaction  which is expected during the first half of  is subject to  among other things  the ability of amsurg and prg to meet all the conditions contemplated under the definitive agreement  amsurg s ability to enter into partnership or operating agreements with the physician owners of prg surgery centers  and amsurg s ability to obtain the necessary financing or capital on terms satisfactory to amsurg 
during  the company had a majority interest in two specialty physician practices which were acquired in january and january  the other partners of which were entities owned by the principal physicians who provide professional medical services to patients of the practices 
in may  the company s board of directors approved a plan to dispose of the company s interests in these two physician practices as part of an overall strategy to exit the practice management business and focus solely on the development  acquisition and operation of ambulatory surgery centers and specialty networks

sources of revenues the company s principal source of revenues is a facility fee charged for surgical procedures performed in its surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly to third party payers by such physicians 
historically  the company s other significant source of revenues had been the fees for physician services performed by two physician group practices in which the company owned a majority interest 
however  as a result of the disposition of these practices occurring in  the company no longer earns such revenue 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers such as those in which the company owns a majority interest depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients
