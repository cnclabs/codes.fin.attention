to a lesser extent  the company is exposed to the risk of price fluctuation on coal  coke  natural gas liquids  electricity and certain nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
the company is also exposed to the effects of price fluctuations on the value of its commodity inventories  specifically  h h s precious metals inventories 
the company s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand

decr 
dollars in thousands financial assets investments in fixed income securities    financial liabilities fixed rate long term debt including amounts due within one year    reflects a increase in interest rates for financial assets and a decrease in interest rates for financial liabilities 
fair value of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  short term borrowings  accounts payable  accrued interest and variable rate long term debt approximate their carrying values and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments or the variable nature of underlying interest rates 
accordingly  these items have been excluded from the table above 
at december   the company s investment portfolio included us government fixed income securities totaling million 
the fair value of these instruments will increase or decrease as a result of changes in market interest rates 
the company accounts for these investments as trading securities as defined by sfas accordingly  each quarter the company adjusts the balance of its portfolio to fair market value  with any resulting adjustment being charged or credited to income as an unrealized loss or gain and included in other income 
realized gains and losses resulting from the disposition of such investments are recorded as income in the period during which such disposition took place 
during  the company recognized realized and unrealized losses totaling million in connection with its fixed income securities investment portfolio 
the company s exposure to increase in interest rates that might result in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of its fixed income securities investment portfolio could have an unfavorable effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
for additional information  see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company attempts to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt in an attempt to keep financing costs as low as possible 
at december   a majority of the company s portfolio of long term debt consisted of fixed rate instruments 
accordingly  the fair value of such instruments may be relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  the fair value of such instruments is also affected by investors assessments of the risks associated with industries in which the company operates as well as the company s overall creditworthiness and ability to satisfy such obligations upon their maturity 
however  the company s sensitivity to interest rate declines and other market risks that might result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of its fixed rate debt portfolio would only have an unfavorable effect on the company s result of operations and cash flows to the extent that the company elected to repurchase or retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at an amount in excess of the corresponding carrying value 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap for certain of its variable rate debt 
the swap agreement covers a notional amount of million and converts million of its variable rate debt to fixed rate with citibank  na new york 
the fixed rate is  effective january   with a termination date of january   however  citibank may designate july  as the termination date 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the company s long term arrangements 
safe harbor the company s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about the risk associated with the company s financial instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices  interest rates and other industry specific risk factors 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes may differ materially from those discussed above 
report of independent accountants to the board of directors and stockholders of whx corporation in our opinion  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations  cash flows and of changes in stockholders equity present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position of whx corporation and its subsidiaries the company at december  and  and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
