overview we are the world leader in developing and manufacturing semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from sic 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment or in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract 
we recognize the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green led products 
we offer leds at two brightness levels high brightness blue and green products and standard blue products 
our led devices are utilized by end users for automotive backlighting  lcd backlighting including wireless handsets  indicator lamps  miniature white lighting  indoor sign and arena displays  outdoor full color stadium displays  traffic signals and other lighting applications 
led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we also derive revenue from the sale of materials products made from sic that are used primarily for research and development for new semiconductor applications 
we also sell sic crystals to c c  which incorporates them in gemstone applications 
sales of sic materials products and sic crystals represented of our revenue in fiscal and approximately during fiscal the balance of our revenue  for fiscal and for fiscal is derived from government contract funding 
under various programs  us government entities further the development of our technology by funding our research and development efforts 
all resulting technology remains our property after the completion of the contract  subject to certain license rights retained by the government 
contract revenue includes funding of direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract ie  certain cost share arrangements  we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses 
we have new product initiatives for rf and microwave transistors and recently began shipping limited quantities of our first rf devices 
we believe that these products can be used in a variety of applications  including power amplifiers for wireless infrastructure  home based subscriber units  digital broadcast applications and solid state radar 
we also have new product initiatives for high power devices for power conversion and switching uses and blue laser diodes for high density digital versatile disk  or dvd  players and other optical storage applications 
we are also developing leds with a higher luminous efficiency to expand our existing family of devices

our high brightness led products experienced the heaviest demand 
while our led chip volume has grown in fiscal over units shipped in fiscal  our average sales prices for leds have also increased over the prior year 
the greater average sales price reflects a significant shift in mix to the higher priced high brightness led products 
during fiscal  the high brightness products sold for an average sales price that was higher than the standard brightness product 
for fiscal  more than of led sales were attributable to high brightness products 
during fiscal  less than of led sales were from the high brightness devices 
the average sales price for the high brightness product line declined in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase in high brightness unit volume was due to the strong demand from customers and the availability of additional capacity from our factory as a result of our facility and equipment expansion and yield improvements 
unit shipments of the high brightness product also increased due to the introduction of small sized chips during the fourth quarter of fiscal the small sized high brightness chips represented of total led volume for that quarter 
while we continue to improve our manufacturing process and yields on our high brightness and standard brightness products  we must continue to significantly increase our production output to meet the growing demands of our customers 
we believe that our led products continue to be attractive to the marketplace due to our low prices and industry standard vertical structure 
we expect that in order to increase market demand for all of our led products  we must continue to lower average sales prices  which is common in our industry 
during fiscal  we believe that the average sales price for all led products will decline based on current and projected orders 
however  we are targeting strong growth for our led revenue in fiscal to more than offset these lower prices with significantly higher volume  stemming from strong customer demand and our continued capacity expansion and yield improvements 
revenue attributable to sales of sic materials was higher in fiscal than the same period in due to a significant increase in sales to c c for gemstone applications and demand for wafer products 
in the second quarter of fiscal  c c announced lower sales and higher inventory levels than anticipated and we agreed to allow c c to reschedule approximately one half of its purchase commitments from the first half of calendar to the second half of the year 
for fiscal  we believe gemstone sales will comprise less than of total revenue and strong demand from our led business will more than offset further reductions in gemstone sales 
demand for our wafer business remains solid  and we are targeting increased revenue from these products in fiscal due to higher demand for optoelectronic production and microwave and power device research 
contract revenue received from us government agencies increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to increased revenue on a microwave contract awarded in late fiscal  and additional contract awards for cree lighting during fiscal we are targeting contract revenue to increase slightly in fiscal based on contracts awarded in late fiscal gross profit gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is due primarily to the rise in led sales volume discussed above and improved profitability 
during fiscal  the average sales price of high brightness and standard brightness led products declined and  respectively  over the prior year 
during the same comparative period  the cost of these devices declined and  respectively 
the lower costs resulted from improved yields and greater throughput 
profits on wafer and gemstone products have also improved during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to higher quality materials being produced with greater yields 
as a result  average wafer costs for sic material sales also declined during fiscal over the comparative period 
for fiscal  we are targeting our average sales prices for leds to decline 
historically  we have been successful in matching lower sales prices with lower costs 
during fiscal  we plan to continue our focus on reducing costs through higher production yields and from significantly greater volumes as fixed costs are spread over a greater number of units 
research and development research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal much of this increase was caused by greater investments for research and development in rf and microwave and optoelectronics programs 
in may of  we signed a million agreement with microvision  inc or mvis  for the development of edge emitting leds and blue laser diodes 
in april  we amended our contract with mvis to extend the agreement for an additional two year period 
under the amended agreement  mvis will fund an additional million 
as development costs are incurred under the original and amended contract  funding from mvis is offset against these expenses 
during fiscal  approximately million of funding from mvis was offset against research and development expenses 
during fiscal  only  was applied to research and development expenses 
the remaining million of funding is expected to be applied to research and development expenses in fiscal and fiscal  with million of funding expected to be applied each year 
we believe that including the offset of mvis funds in fiscal  research and development expenses will continue to grow in future periods  however  we believe that as a percentage of revenue  research and development costs will remain constant 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due primarily to the general growth in our business 
in future periods  we believe that total sales  general and administrative costs will continue to increase in connection with the growth of our business  however  we believe that as a percentage of revenue they will remain constant 
other expense other expense increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher write downs for fixed assets during the year 
other non operating income other non operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to greater income recognized from the sale of investment securities 
during fiscal  a million gain was recognized on the sale of securities 
this gain combined with one time proceeds from an insurance recovery of  more than offset a million one time charge for expenses incurred with the acquisition of nitres  inc in fiscal   was recognized on the sale of securities 
interest income  net interest income  net has increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal as a result of two public stock offerings completed in january and february higher interest rates in fiscal also contributed to increased interest income 
in addition  in november  we obtained a million term loan from nationsbank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing facility in durham  north carolina 
the majority of the interest incurred in the first half of fiscal was expensed and was shown as an offset to interest income  net 
this loan was repaid in the third quarter of fiscal  therefore  there was no interest expense associated with this loan in fiscal income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal over fiscal our effective tax rate during fiscal was compared to in fiscal due to a reduction in the reserve for deferred tax assets 
fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue revenue grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to higher product revenue  which rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in product revenue was a result of the rise in sales of our led products and increase in materials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively 
growth in led volume resulted from the introduction of the new high brightness devices and improvements in the product design of and strong demand for the standard brightness product 
during fiscal  led volume grew while average sales prices declined 
revenue attributable to sales of sic material was higher in fiscal than in the same period of fiscal due to a significant increase in sales to c c for gemstone applications and strong demand for wafer products 
during fiscal  c c was in the initial stages of operation  therefore  unit sales were limited 
revenue from sales of sic wafers were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to quality improvements in wafers  along with the availability of the larger two inch wafer during fiscal during fiscal  sales from our displays business declined from the prior year period as we had chosen to discontinue this product line 
contract revenue received from us government agencies also declined during fiscal compared to fiscal  as a significant contract that funded optoelectronic research was exhausted in early fiscal gross profit gross margin climbed to of revenue during fiscal as compared to during fiscal this increase is predominantly attributable to design and manufacturing improvements that occurred in fiscal resulting in significant reductions in cost 
with the introduction of the new conductive buffer led technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were able to significantly lower costs of production due to fewer manufacturing steps required with the new chip structure and improved yield 
during the first six months of fiscal  we introduced a smaller led chip size and  in december  we began to fabricate devices on a larger two inch wafer 
during much of fiscal  we were still in the process of establishing these new manufacturing designs and had not achieved production efficiency 
in addition  the larger two inch wafer had not been in full production for much of fiscal  therefore  average die yields were significantly lower 
during fiscal  margins realized on the high brightness products were lower than those derived from our standard blue led product  as the yield from the manufacturing process was less than our standard product 
average wafer costs for sic material products sales also declined during fiscal over the comparative period due to more efficient processes and improved yield 
research and development research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal much of this increase was caused by significantly higher costs for the initial development of the new high brightness led products 
in may of  the company signed a million agreement with mvis for the development of edge emitting leds and blue laser diodes 
as development costs were incurred under this contract  funding from mvis was offset against these expenses 
during fiscal  approximately  of funding from mvis was offset against research and development expenses 
the remaining million of funding was applied to research and development expenses in fiscal sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due primarily to the general growth in our business 
in addition  in fiscal two insurance events were recorded that reduced expenses by  as a result of the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit in november  we were reimbursed  for costs incurred in connection with the lawsuit 
most of these expenses were recorded in fiscal in addition  we received a  reimbursement of medical expenses due to a negotiated cost cap in a partially self funded insured health plan 
other expense other expense increased to million during fiscal from  in fiscal during fiscal  we realized impairments to leasehold costs as a result of management s decision to move equipment from our leased facility to our new manufacturing site 
we also wrote off other assets that had no future value to us 
other non operating income other non operating income increased to  in fiscal due to a gain recorded for the sale of securities in that year 
in fiscal there was no other non operating income 
interest income  net interest income  net has increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal due to higher average cash balances being available in fiscal as a result of a public stock offering completed in february a portion of the proceeds received from the offering was used to repay all debt that was outstanding  therefore during much of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was no interest expense incurred 
in november  we obtained a term loan from nationsbank to fund the acquisition and construction of our manufacturing facility in durham  north carolina 
most of that interest was capitalized during fiscal income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from increased profitability during fiscal over fiscal our effective tax rate during fiscal was compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through sales of equity  bank borrowings and revenue from product and contract sales 
as of june   we had working capital of million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
operating activities generated million in fiscal compared with million generated during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to net income and other non cash expenses of million  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and a million tax benefit associated with stock option exercises 
these amounts were partly offset by a million increase in deferred income taxes  and a million rise in inventory 
most of the million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal was related to purchases of held to maturity investments 
we also invested million to acquire available for sale marketable securities 
we invested million in capital expenditures during fiscal compared to million during the same period of the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the increase in spending was due to new equipment additions to increase manufacturing capacity in our crystal growth  epitaxy and package and test areas 
also we completed a  square foot facility expansion at our production site near research triangle park  north carolina and began the construction of an additional  square foot facility expansion at the same site 
in addition  we acquired a  square foot shell building on acres of land near our present facility 
we plan to use this facility for sales  general and administrative  as well as for general employee service functions 
the cost to acquire this facility not including the upfit costs for completing the shell building was million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal related primarily to the receipt of million in net proceeds from the january stock offering and the exercise of stock options and stock warrants 
the stock warrants exercised were distributed in connection with our september private placement and have an exercise price of 
as of june  warrants remained outstanding to purchase  shares  these warrants will expire in september we may also issue additional shares of common stock for the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets 
from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in complementary businesses and anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
we are currently engaged in construction activities relating to a  square foot expansion of our main facility to provide added capacity for our led and materials and future product lines 
we are targeting phases of this project to be finished beginning in december  with the balance targeted for completion within months 
we anticipate total costs for these facilities to be between million and million 
estimates for equipment costs relating to this expansion and other additions total approximately million 
we plan to fund this expansion with cash from operations and cash on hand
