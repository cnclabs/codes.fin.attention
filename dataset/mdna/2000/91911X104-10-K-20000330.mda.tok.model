while the company has historically been able to set its prices for russian markets without government approval  the ruble devaluation has reduced the purchasing power of russian consumers  effectively restricting price increases to a level that does not fully offset the impact of the devaluation 
in an effort to diminish the impact of the decline in gross profit margin  the company has also improved its product mix for the russian market to focus on higher margin products

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for was compared to for the provision for income taxes increased as a result of the effect of higher taxable income in the united states  and the effect of the losses in hungary and china for which no tax benefit was recorded 
these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by higher taxable income in puerto rico and other jurisdictions taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 
the provision for income taxes for includes a deferred tax benefit of  resulting from the recognition of certain deferred tax assets through the reduction of the related valuation allowance 
during  the company acquired certain product rights from roche and skb and in  its partner  schering plough  received fda approval to market rebetron tm  for which the company receives royalties 
these new products and royalties are expected to generate future taxable income that will result in the company realizing its net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  the company has announced its intention to review its strategic options with regards to its biomedicals businesses 
these options include the potential sale of all or a portion of the biomedicals businesses which is expected to result in a net capital gain 
the company will be able to utilize its capital loss carryforwards to offset the gain generated on disposal 
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
in russia  the company continues to benefit from special tax relief that benefits pharmaceutical companies 
under this relief approximately of the income generated in russia related to the manufacture and sale of prescription medicines is exempt from taxation 
this reduces the statutory rate to approximately 
the continuing tax benefits in russia are subject to potential changes in tax law that may be enacted in the future 
should these benefits be repealed  income generated in russia would require the company to provide taxes at the current statutory rate of  which could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operation and cashflows of the company 
icn hungary generated tax loss carryforwards in and in in  the company s russian subsidiaries also generated deferred income tax assets  primarily related to bad debt reserves 
management believes that it is more likely than not that these future tax benefits will not be realized prior to expiration as a result of the seizure of icn yugoslavia and the economic crisis affecting eastern europe

sales of the acquired products generated additional revenues of  in the north america pharmaceuticals segment for in addition  the amounts include  of royalty revenues from sales of ribavirin by schering plough under the license agreement

the current economic environment in russia continues to affect the company s operating cash flows in russia and hungary  as its russian customers continue to experience liquidity problems 
the company may need to invest additional working capital in russia and hungary to sustain its operations  to provide increasing levels of working capital necessary to support renewed growth  and to fund the purchase or upgrading of facilities 
the company also has several preliminary acquisition prospects that may require significant funds through the year however  there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be consummated 
during  the company entered into certain option transactions which allow the company to establish a price range in which the company has the option to repurchase its stock at a later date  without any immediate outlay of its cash resources 
the company entered into these option positions when the company believed its stock to be undervalued  and anticipated that its stock price would appreciate 
under this program  the company sold put options  which entitle the holder to sell the company s stock to the company at a specified price 
at the same time  in a cashless transaction  the company purchased call options  which entitle the company to purchase its stock at a specified price from the same party 
the put and call positions have essentially established a price range within which the company can repurchase its stock 
if the stock price rises above the call option strike price  the repurchase of stock will be at a favorable price compared to the market price 
conversely  if the stock price falls below the put option strike price  the repurchase of stock is more costly than the market price 
the put options and the corresponding call options each expire from august through december and are exercisable only at the expiration dates 
the company may  at its option  make either a physical settlement  a cash settlement  or a net share settlement of its positions under the put and call options 
the company has a maximum potential obligation under the put options to buy back  shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of approximately  the call options entitle the company to buy  shares of its common stock for approximately  the net settlement obligation of the company  based on the closing market price of the stock at december   was approximately  or  shares 
the company continually reevaluates the potential impact of these option positions and believes its capital resources are sufficient to meet the potential obligations of these option positions 
management believes that the company s existing cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements in the near term and to fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the company may also seek additional debt financing or issue additional equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
the company is currently self insured with respect to product liability claims 
while to date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been successfully maintained against the company  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a negative impact on the company s liquidity and financial performance 
foreign operations approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and were generated from operations outside the united states 
all of the company s foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including possible nationalization or expropriation  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  political instability and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time have and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the effect of these risks remains difficult to predict 
the company does not currently provide any hedges on its foreign currency exposure and  in certain countries in which the company operates  no effective hedging programs are available 
russia russia continues to experience economic difficulties following the financial crisis of august consequently  the ruble continues to devalue  there is continued volatility in the debt and equity market  hyperinflation persists  confidence in the banking sector has yet to be restored and there continues to be general lack of liquidity in the economy 
in addition  laws and regulations affecting businesses operating within russia continue to evolve 
russia s return to economic stability is dependent to a large extent on the effectiveness of the measures taken by the government  decisions of international lending organizations  and other actions  including regulatory and political developments  which are beyond the company s control 
since august  the ruble fell sharply from a rate of rubles to to rate of rubles to at december  and has further declined to a rate of rubles to at december  as a result of these declines in the ruble exchange rate  the company recorded translation and exchange losses of  and  related to its russian operations during and  respectively 
as of december   icn russia had a net monetary asset position of approximately  which is subject to foreign exchange loss as further declines in the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar occur 
due to the extremely large fluctuation in the ruble exchange rate  the ultimate amount of any future translation and exchange loss the company may incur cannot presently be determined and such loss may have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s management continues to work to reduce its net monetary exposure by reducing account receivable balances and lengthening its payments to suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
the company s collections on accounts receivable in russia have been adversely affected by the russian economic situation 
prior to the august devaluation of the ruble  the company had favorable experience with the collection of receivables from its customers in the region 
subsequently  the company has taken additional steps to ensure the creditworthiness of its customers and the collectibility of accounts receivable by tightening its credit policies in the region 
these steps include a shortening of credit periods  suspension of sales to customers with past due balances and discounts for cash sales 
the adoption of these more restrictive credit policies has contributed to the decline in sales in russia for compared to the company believes that the economic and political environment in russia has affected the pharmaceutical industry in the region 
many russian companies  including many of the company s customers  continue to experience liquidity problems as monetary policy has limited the money supply  and russian companies often lack access to an effective banking system 
as a result  many russian companies have limited ability to pay their debts  which has led to a number of business failures in the region 
in addition  the devaluation has reduced the purchasing power of russian companies and consumers  thus increasing pressure on the company and other producers to limit price increases in hard currency terms 
as a result of the russian economic situation  the company recorded a charge in of  among several of its operating segments  which is included in eastern european charges  and cost of product sales  in the consolidated statements of income 
the charge consisted of reserves of  for losses on accounts receivable  the write off of certain investments of  and a reduction in the value of certain inventories of  yugoslavia on february   the government of the federal republic of yugoslavia  acting through the federal ministry of health and or the ministry of health of serbia  seized control of the company s owned subsidiary  icn yugoslavia 
this action  based on a decision by the ministry for economic and property transformation that was reached on november   effectively reduced the company s equity ownership of icn yugoslavia from to 
the ministry of economic and property transformation decision was based on a unilaterally imposed recalculation of the company s original capital contribution to icn yugoslavia 
subsequent to the seizure  the commercial court of belgrade issued an order stating that a change in control had occurred 
these actions were taken  contrary to yugoslavian law  without any notification to or representation by the company 
since the change of control  representatives of the company and icn yugoslavia s management have been denied access to the premises and any representation as to the management of icn yugoslavia 
prior to the seizure  icn yugoslavia s operations were adversely affected by the april devaluation of the dinar  which resulted in foreign exchange losses of  for the year 
icn yugoslavia s domestic sales were adversely affected by the company s previously announced suspension of sales to the yugoslavian government 
in addition  icn yugoslavia s export sales for the second half of were adversely affected by the russian economic crisis 
in the second and third quarters of  the yugoslavian government defaulted on its obligations to the company on  of accounts and notes receivable

the charge consists of  reserve for losses on notes receivable including accrued interest  reserves of  for losses on accounts receivable from government sponsored entities  and a  write down of the value of certain related investments and assets 
the company has commenced litigation in the united states district court of the district of columbia against the government of yugoslavia and related agencies to recover damages and obtain injunctive relief 
in addition  the government of yugoslavia  through a related agency  filed an arbitration proceeding against the company before the international chamber of commerce for damages related to the company s acquisition of majority control of icn yugoslavia 
the resolution of these matters may affect the status of certain compounds  which were contributed to icn yugoslavia by the company  pursuant to the agreement that led to the formation of icn yugoslavia 
acquired products the majority of products acquired by the company in and were mature products with no effective patents  either because of expirations or the absence of legal protections provided by the local governments in the respective markets 
under the company s ownership  price increases and additional advertising and promotions were planned for certain selected products  as the company believes that they were not marketed to their greatest potential 
the company believes that certain of these products in specific markets have an adequate growth potential  and intends to develop a product strategy for each product 
the company believes that these products will continue to generate significant sales even without patent protection because the trademarks under which they are marketed are well established and enjoy substantial customer brand loyalty 
moreover  the relatively small sales volumes and market sizes for some of these products pose significant barriers to entry of generic competition 
the company estimated the remaining life of these products based on anticipated future profits assuming a constant profit margin for the remaining product cycle 
it should be noted  however  any sales growth or increase in profitability attained by additional marketing efforts is expected to be relatively short lived 
after a temporary boost  these products will revert to their gradually declining trend in accordance with the product cycle model 
the acquired products historical operating results demonstrated their ability to earn substantial excess profits 
excess profits are directly related to their competitive advantage primarily attributable to the product quality and reputation 
the useful life was defined as the number of years for the forecasted annual product sales to reach of the cumulative historical amount through during the forecasted period  only gradual declines are expected due to the absence of immediate threats from competition of generic or and alternative products 
based upon the company s analysis  the useful lives of products acquired during and were estimated to be years 
inflation and changing prices the effects of inflation are experienced by the company through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
the company is subject to price control restrictions on its pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which it operates 
while the company attempts to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  the company has been affected by the lag in price increases in russia and mexico  which has created lower sales in us dollars and reductions in gross profit 
future sales and gross profit will be reduced if the company is unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation 
the russian government has recently instituted a process for establishing prices for pharmaceutical products  which may lead to price controls in the russian market in the future 
currently  this process requires the company to register the prices for certain of its products included on the government s list of products important for health 
the next procedure for registration includes the negotiation and approval of such prices between the company and the relevant state bodies 
the company is currently working with all relevant state bodies to approve its prices and the company is not presently able to determine the effect  if any  that this process may have on its results of operations 
however  such developments could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows in russia 
the year issue many computer systems and equipment or instruments with embedded microprocessors were designed to recognize only the last two digits of a calendar year 
as previously reported  the company undertook an extensive project to remediate or replace its date sensitive systems and microprocessors that might have encountered operational problems due to their inability to distinguish the years after from years preceding since january  the company s computer systems and other potentially date sensitive types of equipment have operated properly and there has been no adverse impact on operations 
in addition  there was no material impact from year related issues at any of the company s customers  suppliers  or other outside service providers 
the company did not experience any significant impact on product sales or revenues as a result of year concerns 
as of december   the company has spent approximately  on the overall year remediation and equipment upgrade project 
the project is now complete and no future costs are planned 
all systems have functioned properly since january and the company s management believes that future operations will be unaffected by the year issue 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union introduced a new currency called the euro 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations existing legacy currencies were fixed irrevocably as of january  prior to full implementation of the new currency on january   there will be a transition period during which parties may  at their discretion  use either the legacy currencies or the euro for financial transactions 
the company expects its affected subsidiaries to continue to operate primarily in their respective legacy currencies for at least one more year 
the majority of the company s affected subsidiaries currently can accommodate transactions for customers or suppliers operating in either the legacy currency or the euro 
action plans are currently being implemented which are expected to result in full compliance with all laws and regulations relating to the euro conversion 
such plans include the adaptation of information technology and other systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions as well as the requirements of the transition period 
the company is also addressing the impact of the euro on its currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
while it is not possible to accurately predict the impact the euro will have on the company s business or on the economy in general  management currently does not anticipate that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on the company s market risk with respect to foreign exchange  its results of operations  or its financial condition

the financial assets of the company are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short duration

the principal financial liabilities of the company that are subject to interest rate risk are its fixed rate long term debt principally its senior notes due and its senior notes due totaling approximately million 
the company does not use any derivatives or similar instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately of the company s weighted average interest rate on fixed rate debt affecting the company s financial instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company s pretax earnings
