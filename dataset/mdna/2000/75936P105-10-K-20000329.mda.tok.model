inflation substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s office leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount

a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation

wellsford whitehall  wellsford capital and wellsford development  which constitute all of the company s property operations  had completed their analyses of such systems by september  and determined that no material adverse consequences were likely to result from their yk issues 
under the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  wherein the managers failed to update their software and non it systems  the company had the ability to convert its accounting and management systems to a spreadsheet based system on a temporary basis and to utilize its building engineers to manually override any non it systems which fail 
furthermore  the company had contacted its key vendors  tenants  banks  joint venture partners  creditors  and debtors and had obtained yk compliance certification either verbal or written from the majority of them

net cash flow the company considers net cash flow to be an important measure of its performance  to be considered in addition to net income predicated on generally accepted accounting principles 
net cash flow  for the company s purposes  represents net income  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
included in such cash flow is the company s share of undistributed cash retained by the unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures for continuing investment in lieu of future fundings 
net cash flow should not be considered a replacement for net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs
