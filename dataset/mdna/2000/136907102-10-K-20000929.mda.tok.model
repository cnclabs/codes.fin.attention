item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed in cautionary statements as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this prospectus 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  and service lasers used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers principally to medical practitioners 
candela markets its products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
over of our revenue in fiscal came from international sales 
we derive our revenue from the sale of lasers and other products  the provision of product related services  and the operations of our remaining skin care center 
domestic and international product sales are generated principally through our direct sales force based in the us and five international offices 
prior to fiscal  a relatively small portion of our sales have come through our network of independent distributors 
in december  we entered into an exclusive distributorship arrangement with physician sales and service pss whose representatives target general practice physicians and certain specialists in the us sales to distributors for the years ended july  and july   increased as a result of this arrangement 
we typically assemble products in our wayland  massachusetts  facility in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in the quarter ending in september due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
all product shipments include a month parts and service warranty 
the anticipated cost associated with the warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment and amortized over the warranty period as a cost of sales charged to service revenue 
costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of product related service revenue 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended warranty contracts  which are typically for a to month period 
an extended month warranty contract is standard with the purchase of our v beam tm system 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors 
in june  we began an effort to own and operate skin care centers offering cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
we pursued this strategy by purchasing an existing spa in boston in in march  we opened a new skin care center in scottsdale  arizona  with no pre existing client base 
we subsequently decided to reduce our focus on our skin care center efforts and to renew our commitment to our core aesthetic and cosmetic laser business 
in the quarter ending december   we closed our scottsdale facility because it had failed to generate any material revenue from its inception  recorded a restructuring charge  and established a reserve in the amount of million which represented the anticipated cost associated with this closure 
in january  we ceased to offer aesthetic laser procedures at our boston skin care center because the rate of performance was insufficient to justify the associated costs  but we continue to provide personal care and health and beauty services from this location 
we are actively seeking buyers to assume the leases and purchase the assets of both the scottsdale and boston facilities 
international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  france  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  during the fiscal years ended july   and july   represented of total sales  and for the year ended june  our fiscal year consists of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to june of each year 
the years ended july   july   and june   contained  and weeks  respectively

total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for both fiscal and fiscal laser and product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due to our initial shipments of our new vbeam tm laser system for the treatment of vascular lesions and continued strong sales of our gentlelase registered trademark hair removal system 
product related service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased shipments of consumables used with our vbeam tm  gentlelase registered trademark  and sclero products as well as an increase in the sale of service contracts 
skin care center revenue increased to million in fiscal compared to million in  due to increased marketing and promotional activities for our boston spa 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal mainly as a result of increased sales of higher margin gentlelase registered trademark and vbeam registered trademark systems 
gross profit on lasers and other products increased to million or in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal gross profit for service revenue in fiscal increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal resulting from the increase in the number of units in service 
skin care center gross profit for fiscal year increased to million or of revenue in comparison to million or of revenue for fiscal year resulting from a combination of increased number of services and emphasis placed on cost control within the center 
research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal increased to million  from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expense reflects efforts to develop new products and product improvements designed to enhance  augment  and expand our existing product lines 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this reflects additional expenditures incurred to support our increased sales volume 
this includes increased commission and travel costs as well as expenditures relating to our offices in frankfurt  paris  and osaka 
these offices were opened during the course of fiscal and and did not have a full year of expenses in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million resulting from the closure of the skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  a total of  was charged against this reserve  representing costs associated with the closure of the scottsdale facility leaving a reserve balance of million 
candela continues to pursue a sublease of the scottsdale facility  but if this effort is not successful  we could incur additional costs in excess of our existing reserve 
management believes that the reserve established to date will be sufficiently adequate so that no additional material charges will need to be recorded for at least the next months 
operating income 
income from operations for the year ended july   increased by million to million  up from million a year earlier 
the improved performance was a result of increased revenue from product sales 
other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended july   total other income was million in comparison to other expense of million for the same period a year earlier 
this increase was a result of increased interest income due to our substantially higher cash balances in fiscal in comparison to fiscal operating margins for future periods will be impacted by a modified royalty formulation with respect to our dcd license from the regents negotiated in august of  since the same royalty rate will mow apply to more components sold 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   reflects the utilization of tax credits generated in the current and tax provisions calculated in japan and spain at a rate in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
as of july   there were no federal net operating loss carryforwards and the federal tax credit carryforwards 
we also released million of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal and are approximately and  respectively 
during fiscal  candela believed it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset would be utilized during the current year 
therefore  the company  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards board no 
accounting for income taxes  decreased in valuation allowance against current year taxable income  resulting in a decrease to its effective rate 
fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international product revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for fiscal compared to for the same period in laser and product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due mainly to a significant increase in the volume of both domestic and international shipments of the gentlelase registered trademark  which we began shipping in march product related service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to shipments of consumables used with the gentlelase registered trademark and sclero products 
skin care center revenue increased to million in compared to million in  due to increased marketing and promotional activities for our boston spa 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal as a result of increased sales of higher margin gentlelase registered trademark and higher absorption of fixed portions of manufacturing overhead 
gross profit on lasers and other products increased to million or in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal gross profit for service revenue in fiscal increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal skin care center gross profit for the year ended july  was positively impacted  in comparison to  by the closure of the scottsdale facility in the second quarter of fiscal research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal increased to million  from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expense reflects efforts to develop products and product improvements designed to enhance  augment  and expand existing product lines 
research and development expense also includes approximately  of management bonuses  which are tied to pre tax profits 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this reflects increased staffing levels in the sales and marketing departments incurred to support revenue growth  partially offset by savings realized from operating one skin care center rather than two during the first six months of the fiscal year 
also affecting selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal was an expense of approximately million for the payment of management bonuses that are tied to pre tax profits derived from product and service revenue 
in fiscal  the management bonus accrued amounted to approximately  in relation to revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million resulting from the closure of the skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  a total of  was charged against this reserve  representing costs associated with the closure of the scottsdale facility leaving a reserve balance of million 
operating income 
income from operations for the year ended july   increased by million  from a loss of million in fiscal to a profit of million  in fiscal the improved performance was a result of both increased revenue from product sales and reduced expenses in connection with operations of the skin care centers 
other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended july   total other expense was  in comparison to  for the same period a year earlier 
the increase resulted from an increase in interest expenses from the debt issued in october   partially offset by a decrease in exchange losses from our foreign operations and an increase in interest income resulting from higher cash balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   reflects the utilization of the domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax provisions calculated in japan and spain at a rate in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at june   the beginning of the current fiscal year 
based on current year operating results  we utilized all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and the federal tax credit carryforwards 
we also released million of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is approximately 
during the second quarter of fiscal  candela believed that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset would be utilized during therefore  the company  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes  decreased its valuation allowance for the portion related to the utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards against current year taxable income  resulting in a decrease to its effective rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  reflecting increased operating profit offset by an increase in account receivables and other assets 
cash used in investing activities totaled  for fiscal compared to  for the same period a year earlier resulting from a reduction in the amount of assets sold in fiscal cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in in comparison to  for this was a result of completing our secondary offering in july   with the proceeds offset by the cost of candela shares repurchased in the open market during the fourth quarter of fiscal cash and cash equivalents at july  increased by million to million from million at july   primarily due to the cash proceeds received from our july  secondary offering 
we completed a public offering in july  for  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by candela and  shares were sold by certain selling shareholders 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our shares 
on october   we issued eight year  subordinated term notes to three investors in the aggregate amount of million  secured by the company s assets 
the notes become due in october   and require quarterly interest payments 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to the note holders that have an exercise price of per share 
the relative fair value ascribed to the warrants is  and has been recorded as a component of additional paid in capital in stockholders equity 
the relative fair value of the debt was recorded as  the debt will be accreted to face value using the interest method over eight years  which will result in interest expense of  over the eight year period in addition to the face interest 
the company also maintains a renewable  revolving credit agreement with a major bank with interest at the bank s base rate 
any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are due on demand or according to a payment schedule established at the time funds are borrowed 
the line of credit is unsecured 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants limiting the establishment of new liens  and the purchase of margin stock 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of july  our remaining short term and long term debt is comprised of capital lease obligations in the amount of  and  respectively  at july   compared to  and  respectively  at july  we believe that cash balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements through the first quarter of fiscal however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such as it becomes required 
year readiness disclosure statement we have executed a plan designed to make our products  information technology systems and equipment year ready 
to date  we have experienced no significant problems in our products  business interruptions or material adverse effects from the year issue 
however  we could still experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects from the year issue 
we cannot guarantee that our year readiness plan has been successfully implemented  and actual results could still differ materially from our plan cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements concerning the future of the industry  product development  business strategy including the possibility of future acquisitions  anticipated operational and capital expenditure levels  continued acceptance and growth of our products  and dependence on significant customers and suppliers 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that we have made based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  operations  and prospects  not historical facts 
we have made these forward looking statements pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  and may contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this annual report on form k 
the cautionary statements noted below and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
we may not update or publicly release the results of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
because we derive more than half of our revenue from international sales  including approximately one third of our revenue from japan and the asia pacific marketplace in fiscal  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  negative economic changes taking place in japan and the asia pacific marketplace  and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell a significant portion of our products and services outside the us and canada 
international sales  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  accounted for of our revenue for fiscal year  and we expect that they will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
other risks associated with international sales which we have faced in the past include longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  failure to obtain or significant delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for our products  and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 
the failure to obtain alexandrite rods for the gentlelase registered trademark and alexlazr tm from our sole supplier would impair our ability to manufacture and sell gentlelase registered trademark 
we use alexandrite rods to manufacture the gentlelase registered trademark and the alexlazr tm  which account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we depend exclusively on litton airtron synoptics to supply these rods  for which no alternative supplier meeting our quality standards exists 
we cannot be certain that litton will be able to meet our future requirements at current prices or at all 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of alexandrite rods in a timely manner  but any extended interruption in our supplies could hurt our results 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has had the least amount of revenue in any quarter of our fiscal year 
the results of the first quarter are directly impacted by the seasonality of the purchasing cycle 
in the last three fiscal years  first quarter revenue has been below the previous quarter s revenue in the range of to 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control  including the following market supply and demand potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between us and our competitors  potential decrease in demand for our products  and possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
customer behavior changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles  and changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
company operations absence of significant product backlogs  our effectiveness in our manufacturing process  unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations  and timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
the cost of closing our skin care centers may be higher than management has estimated to date  and higher actual costs would negatively impact our operating results 
we have renewed our commitment to expand and diversify our core cosmetic and surgical laser equipment business 
as part of this refocus  we decided to reduce our focus on our efforts to own and operate centers which would offer cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
although we are actively seeking buyers for the two skin care centers we opened which are located in scottsdale  arizona  and boston  massachusetts  we cannot be certain that a sale or sublease of either facility will be completed on favorable terms or at all 
we have established a reserve to accrue for the anticipated costs of terminating the scottsdale facility  but we can t be sure that such a reserve will be adequate 
to date  we have not established a reserve in connection with the boston facility  which we are continuing to operate as a spa without providing cosmetic laser services 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology and intense competition in the laser industry could make our lasers obsolete 
the aesthetic and cosmetic laser equipment industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
to be successful  we must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and new applications of existing technology 
our financial condition and operating results could be hurt if our products fail to compete favorably in response to such technological developments  or we are not agile in responding to competitors new product introductions or product price reductions 
in addition  we compete against numerous companies offering products similar to ours  some of which have greater financial  marketing  and technical resources than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies and our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
like other companies in our industry  we are subject to a regulatory review process and our failure to receive necessary government clearances or approvals could affect our ability to sell our products and remain competitive 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that most of our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
particularly  for example  we are awaiting ministry of health approval in japan for the sale of scleroplus tm and the vbeam tm 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or continue to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such foreign regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we have modified some of our products without fda clearance 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications were improper and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties against us  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing product approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
our industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the us until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the us accordingly  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
any claims of patent infringement would be time consuming and could result in costly litigation  divert our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the laser industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could hurt our gross margins 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or the failure to obtain necessary licenses  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products  which could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
on the other hand  we may have to start costly and time consuming litigation in order to enforce our patents  to protect trade secrets  and know how owned by us or to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we have received correspondence from palomar medical technologies  the exclusive licensee from star medical technologies of certain united states patents  and also from star medical  offering to grant us a nonexclusive license to such patents 
we have engaged in discussions with palomar relative to these patents  but have not yet decided on a specific course of action 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims 
there are various risks of physical injury to the patient when using our lasers for aesthetic and cosmetic treatments 
injuries often result in product liability or other claims being brought against the practitioner utilizing the device and us 
the costs and management time we would have to spend in defending or settling any such claims  or the payment of any award in connection with such claims  could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that our policy will provide sufficient coverage for any claim or claims that may arise  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on favorable economic terms 
we may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key research  development  sales  and marketing personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could hurt our future operating results 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we cannot be certain that we will attract  retain  and motivate sufficient numbers of such personnel 
our failure to manage future acquisitions and joint ventures effectively may divert management attention from our core business and cause us to incur additional debt  liabilities or costs 
we may acquire businesses  products  and technologies that complement or expand our business 
we may also consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects 
we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates  successfully negotiate  finance  or integrate any businesses  products  or technologies that we acquire  or successfully manage any joint ventures or collaborations 
furthermore  the integration of any acquisition or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
if we fail to manage these acquisitions or joint ventures effectively we may incur debts or other liabilities or costs which could harm our operating results or financial condition 
while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies  consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects  and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations  we have no present understandings  commitments  or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or joint ventures
