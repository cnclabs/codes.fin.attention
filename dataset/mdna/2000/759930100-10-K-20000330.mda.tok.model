item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group  inc provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
the company began operating in february when it acquired the founding companies in the combination simultaneous with its initial public offering 
as of december   the company provided dialysis and ancillary services to approximately  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services in hospitals 
for the comparison discussion that follows  the selected historical financial data include the financial information of companies acquired in previously reported transactions accounted for as poolings of interests 
on january   the company merged with dca in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
consistent with other pooling of interests transactions  the comparison discussion that follows includes supplemental selected combined amounts that include the combined results of renal care group and dialysis centers of america  inc because the companies added in pooling transactions were independent and not operated by renal care group s management before the dates of acquisition  the historical results of such companies before such times may not be indicative of future performance 
renal care group s net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with dialysis  primarily the administration of erythropoietin also known as epogen r or epo  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided pursuant to contracts with acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  management contracts with hospital based and medical university dialysis programs  laboratory services  and wound care and diabetes services 
patients with end stage renal disease typically receive three dialysis treatments each week  with reimbursement for services provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by the health care financing administration 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
effective january  congress increased the medicare composite rate by 
an additional increase of is scheduled to take effect in january the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for such treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services provided by renal care group 
certain other services  laboratory tests  and drugs are eligible for separate reimbursement under medicare and are not part of the composite rate  including specific drugs such as epo and certain physician ordered tests provided to dialysis patients 
for patients with private health insurance  dialysis was historically reimbursed at rates higher than medicare during the first months of treatment  and after that time medicare became the primary payor 
effective august   however  the balanced budget act provided that the health insurance coordination period during which private insurance must pay for dialysis was extended to months of treatment  and after that period medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and generally is higher on a per treatment equivalent basis than the medicare composite rate 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy used to treat a chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
renal care group derives a significant portion of its net revenue and net income from the administration of epo 
epo is manufactured by a single company 
in february  this manufacturer announced a increase in its price for epo 
renal care group estimates that this price increase will reduce its earnings per share by up to for the year ending december  the company does not know the precise effect of the increase  since renal care group s new contract with amgen may allow it to mitigate the price increase to some extent
