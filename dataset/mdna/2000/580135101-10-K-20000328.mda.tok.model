the transaction is expected to close in mid systemwide sales systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements 
we continue to focus on increasing market share through expansion and comparable sales increases with an emphasis on increasing customer satisfaction through quality  service  cleanliness and value 
constant currency sales increases in and were primarily due to restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales 
in  the stronger japanese yen had a greater positive currency translation effect on sales compared with revenues 
this is due to our affiliate structure in japan 
under this structure  we record a royalty in revenues based on a percentage of japan s sales  whereas all of japan s sales are included in systemwide sales 
for this reason  systemwide sales were less negatively affected by foreign currency translation than were revenues 
in  and  more than of systemwide sales were in the following eight markets australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  japan  the uk and the uk referred to as the major markets 
in the us and europe  expansion and positive comparable sales drove sales increases in and in the us  successful promotions combined with local market initiatives and new product introductions contributed to the increases in both years 
in europe  successful promotions and value campaigns in france  germany  spain and the uk drove the increases in both years 
europe s results were dampened in by the difficult economic conditions in russia 
in asia pacific  the and constant currency sales increases were driven by expansion  partly offset by negative comparable sales 
in  china  south korea and the southeast asian markets were the primary contributors to the increase 
in addition  expansion in japan and positive comparable sales in australia contributed to the increase 
in latin america  expansion drove the constant currency sales increase  which was partly offset by negative comparable sales 
expansion in brazil and positive double digit comparable sales in mexico and venezuela helped drive the increase 
in  sales increased due to expansion and positive comparable sales 
in the other segment  canada s positive comparable sales in both years drove the constant currency sales increases

excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
na not applicable average sales are affected by several factors comparable sales and the size  location and number of new restaurants 
the number of new restaurants affects average sales as new restaurants historically have taken a few years to reach long term volumes 
in addition  over the last several years we have opened more restaurants in lower density areas outside the us and in countries with lower average sales volumes 
for these reasons  our focus is primarily on sales to investment ratios on individual sites and building comparable sales  rather than on average sales 
in and  positive comparable sales drove the increases in us average annual sales per restaurant 
outside the us  the decreases in average annual sales per traditional restaurant on a constant currency basis were due to the significant number of new restaurants added 
in and  average annual sales volumes of existing restaurants restaurants opened more than months increased over the prior year on a constant currency basis 
in  average annual sales for satellite restaurants located in brazil  canada and japan  which comprise substantially all satellites outside the us  declined slightly in constant currencies  primarily due to an increase in the number of satellites in brazil  which serve only desserts 
satellite restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants 
the utilization of these small  often limited menu restaurants has allowed profitable expansion into areas that would otherwise not have been feasible

on a constant currency basis  the average annual sales for new traditional restaurants outside the us increased in and in in  average annual sales for new satellite restaurants outside the us decreased in constant currencies  primarily due to proportionally more satellites in brazil 
total revenues total revenues include sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees include rent  service fees and royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees 
fees vary by type of site and investment by the company  and also according to local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have year terms 
revenues grow as new restaurants are added and as sales build in existing restaurants 
menu price changes also affect revenues and sales  but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures  new products  promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets 
on a constant currency basis  total revenues increased at a higher rate than sales in and  due to the higher unit growth rate of company operated restaurants relative to systemwide restaurants 
in both years  this was primarily due to expansion in europe and the consolidation of several affiliate markets due to an increase in ownership 
us revenues increased million in and million in and accounted for almost of consolidated revenues in both years 
the revenue growth in both years was primarily due to positive comparable sales and expansion 
europe s reported revenues grew million in and million in and accounted for more than of consolidated revenues in both years 
on a constant currency basis  europe s revenues increased million in and million in the increases in both years were driven by expansion and positive comparable sales for the segment and strong sales performances in france  germany and the uk in addition  the increase benefited from the consolidation of sweden for financial reporting purposes 
reported revenues in asia pacific increased million in and million in on a constant currency basis  these revenues increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was driven primarily by strong sales in china and south korea 
positive comparable sales in australia also contributed to the increase 
the increase in was primarily due to the consolidation of several affiliate markets as a result of an increase in ownership 
latin america s reported revenues declined million in compared with an increase of million in the reported decline in was primarily due to the currency devaluation in brazil that occurred in early  and the resultant difficult economic conditions in several markets

operating margins operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald s restaurant business only and exclude other brands 
company operated margins company operated margin dollars are equal to sales by company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants 
company operated margin dollars increased million or in and million or in in constant currencies  the increases were million or in and million or in the increases were primarily driven by expansion 
company operated margins were of sales in  in and in operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows food paper costs were flat in and decreased in  payroll costs increased in and were flat in  and occupancy other operating costs increased in both years 
company operated margins dollars in millions us europe asia pacific latin america other total    percent of sales us europe asia pacific latin america other total relates to mcdonald s restaurant business only and excludes other brands 
us company operated margins increased as a percent of sales in due to lower food paper costs as a result of less waste partly due to the implementation of our made for you food preparation system and lower commodity costs  as well as lower occupancy other operating costs 
these cost reductions were partly offset by higher payroll costs  due to an increase in average hourly rates 
us company operated margins as a percent of sales in reflected lower food paper costs  primarily due to lower commodity costs  and higher payroll costs  due to increased average hourly rates 
europe s company operated margins as a percent of sales declined in as payroll costs increased  food paper costs decreased  and occupancy other operating expenses were flat 
the difficult economic conditions in russia accounted for more than half of the decline in europe s margin percent from in asia pacific and latin america  company operated margins declined as a percent of sales in and the september earthquake in taiwan resulted in a temporary reduction in consumer spending 
in addition  a difficult comparison to strong promotions in hong kong contributed to asia pacific s decline 
in latin america  the margin declines were due to difficult economic conditions in several markets and negative comparable sales in while brazil was the primary contributor to the decline in both years  its margin trends improved during the second half of compared with the first half of the year 
in  weaker foreign currencies in both asia pacific and latin america lowered margins as food paper costs were negatively affected in markets where we import products 
franchised margins franchised margin dollars are equal to revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with these sites 
franchised margin dollars represented more than of the combined operating margins in  and franchised margin dollars increased million or in and million or in in constant currencies  the increases were million or in and million or in the increases were primarily driven by expansion and positive comparable sales 
franchised margins dollars in millions us    europe asia pacific latin america other total    percent of revenues us europe asia pacific latin america other total relates to mcdonald s restaurant business only and excludes other brands 
franchised margins were of applicable revenues in  in and in the declines in consolidated margin percents reflected higher occupancy costs due to an increased number of leased sites in all geographic segments 
our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites over the past few years has reduced initial capital requirements and related interest expense  resulting in higher returns on capital invested 
however  as anticipated  franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues have been negatively impacted because financing costs implicit in the lease are included in rent expense  which affects these margins  for owned sites  financing costs are reflected in interest expense  which does not affect these margins 
the higher occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales in and also  our purchase of a majority interest in several affiliate markets in and shifted revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants to company operated restaurants  reducing the franchised restaurant margin percents outside the us this was the primary cause for the decline in europe s margin percent in and in asia pacific s margin percent in selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased in while decreasing to of sales from of sales in and of sales in the increase in was due to the consolidation of sweden for financial reporting purposes  spending to support mcdonald s restaurant development and the addition of other brands 
us selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to savings realized from the home office productivity initiative 
in  consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were flat  due to lower advertising costs and home office productivity savings in the us offsetting increased spending to support international restaurant development 
as a result of the home office productivity initiative  the company expects to save about million of selling  general and administrative expenses annually in and thereafter 
about two thirds of these savings were realized through other operating income and expense other operating income and expense includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net gains or losses from property dispositions and other transactions related to the food service business 
other operating income and expense dollars in millions gains on sales of restaurant businesses equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net losses from property dispositions other total made for you costs special charge gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements arrangements where the company leases the businesses  including equipment  to owner operators who have options to purchase the businesses 
the company s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market 
these transactions are an integral part of our franchising business and resulting gains are recorded in operating income 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses in which the company actively participates  but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes  except for us restaurant partnerships  which are reported before income taxes 
net gains or losses from property dispositions result from disposals of properties due to restaurant closings  relocations and other transactions 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in included a million gain from the sale of real estate in a us partnership 
results in japan  which benefited from a lower effective tax rate and the stronger japanese yen  also contributed to the increase 
net losses from property dispositions reflected the write off of million of software not used in the business in and a higher number of restaurant closings in made for you costs during  the company completed the installation of the new made for you food preparation system in virtually all restaurants in the us and canada 
through advances in equipment and technology  the new system allows us to serve fresher  better tasting food at the speed of mcdonald s 
the system also supports future growth through product development because it can more easily accommodate an expanded menu 
as part of the plan to introduce this system  the company provided financial incentives during and of up to  per restaurant to owner operators to defray the cost of equipment made obsolete as a result of converting to the new system 
the company also made additional payments in special cases where the conversion to made for you was more extensive 
the company incurred million of made for you costs in and million in  primarily consisting of incentive payments made to owner operators as well as accelerated depreciation on equipment replaced in company operated restaurants 
special charge in second quarter  the company recorded a million pre tax special charge related to the company s home office productivity initiative 
the productivity plan was designed to improve staff alignment  focus and productivity and reduce ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  the company reduced home office staffing by approximately positions  consolidated certain home office facilities and reduced other expenditures in a variety of areas 
the special charge was comprised of million of employee severance and outplacement costs  million of lease cancellation and other facilities related costs  million of costs for the write off of technology investments made obsolete as a result of the productivity initiative  and million of other cash payments made in the initiatives identified in the home office productivity plan were completed as of december   and no significant adjustments were made to the original plan

france  germany and the uk accounted for about of europe s operating income in  and asia pacific s operating income increased million or in compared with a decrease of million or in on a constant currency basis  this segment s operating income increased and in and  respectively 
the increase in was driven primarily by japan  which benefited from a lower effective tax rate  and strong results in south korea 
in addition  improved results in several southeast asian markets contributed to the increase 
the september earthquake in taiwan caused a temporary reduction in consumer spending and tempered the segment s results

partly offsetting the decrease were the strong performances in mexico and venezuela 
while brazil s results have improved since the first half of  it is still experiencing the negative effects of the currency devaluation that occurred in early expansion and positive comparable sales drove improved results across this segment in brazil has accounted for approximately of latin america s operating income in constant currencies in each of the past three years 
interest expense interest expense decreased in due to lower average interest rates and weaker foreign currencies  partly offset by higher average debt levels 
in  higher average debt levels more than offset the weaker foreign currencies and lower average interest rates  causing an increase in interest expense 
lower average interest rates in both years were partly due to the company s use of interest rate exchange agreements 
nonoperating income expense nonoperating income expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income  minority interests and gains and losses related to other investments  financings and translation 
results in reflected lower translation losses than results in reflected translation gains

restaurants mcdonald s continues to focus on managing capital outlays more effectively through prudent and selective expansion 
in  the company added  mcdonald s restaurants systemwide  compared with  in and  in in  the company expects to add between  and  mcdonald s restaurants  with a continued emphasis on traditional restaurants primarily in locations outside the us restaurant additions for other brands are anticipated to be between and in in the us  a more selective restaurant development process reduced gross openings in and compared with also in  more low volume satellites were closed  further reducing net additions 
asia pacific s percent of total restaurants has grown primarily due to japan s significant expansion 
japan added restaurants in and in  representing more than of restaurant additions in both years 
approximately of japan s restaurant additions in and about in were satellites 
these units have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes  compared with traditional restaurants 
therefore  these additions contribute significantly more to unit growth than sales growth 
approximately of systemwide restaurants were in the major markets at the end of both and in  of restaurant additions were in these major markets  and we anticipate a similar percent for longer term  china  italy  mexico  south korea and spain  which together represented more than of mcdonald s additions in  are expected to represent a growing proportion of restaurant additions 
systemwide restaurants us    europe    asia pacific    latin america    other    total    almost of company operated restaurants and nearly of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of franchisees and affiliates operated of restaurants at year end that percentage has remained relatively constant over the past three years 
satellite units at december  were as follows us  europe  asia pacific primarily japan  latin america primarily brazil  and other primarily canada financial position and capital resources total assets and capital expenditures total assets grew billion or in and billion or in at year end and  about of consolidated assets were located in our major markets excluding our affiliate in japan

capital expenditures decreased million or in and decreased million or in  reflecting our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites  the us new building program that gives owner operators the option to own new restaurant facilities  weaker foreign currencies  and in  fewer restaurant additions 
capital expenditures in included increased capital outlays for existing us company operated restaurants related to implementation of the new made for you food preparation system  and spending to update and refresh existing us restaurants 
more than of qualifying new and rebuilt us traditional restaurant buildings opened in are owned by owner operators 
in addition  the company leased the land for over of new us traditional restaurants opened in the new building program  combined with our decision to lease more land  saved the company approximately million in capital outlays in more than of capital expenditures was invested in markets outside the us in  and  and more than was invested in our major markets excluding japan in all three years 
capital expenditures dollars in millions new restaurants    existing restaurants other properties total    total assets    expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction  including technology to improve service and food quality such as the made for you food preparation system in the us and canada  and to enhance older facilities 
other properties primarily included expenditures for office buildings and related computer equipment and furnishings 
the company s expenditures for new restaurants in the us were minimal as a result of the building and leasing programs previously discussed 
for new franchised and affiliated restaurants  which represent about of all us restaurants  the company generally incurs no capital expenditures 
however  the company still has long term occupancy rights for the land and receives related rental income 
for new company operated restaurants  the company generally leases the land and owns the restaurant building and equipment 
average development costs outside the us vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market 
these costs  which include land  buildings and equipment owned by the company  are managed through the use of right sized restaurants  construction and design efficiencies  standardization and global sourcing 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs  especially in those markets where construction materials cannot be obtained locally 
average development costs for traditional restaurants in major markets outside the us  excluding our japan affiliate  were approximately million in  million in and million in average annual sales per new traditional restaurant for the same markets were approximately million in  million in and million in average development costs for satellite restaurants located in brazil  canada and japan were approximately  in each of the last three years 
the utilization of these small  often limited menu restaurants has allowed expansion into areas that would otherwise not have been feasible 
including affiliates  total land ownership was and of total restaurant sites at year end and  respectively 
capital expenditures by affiliates  which were not included in consolidated amounts  were approximately million in  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to increased ownership in sweden  partly offset by stronger foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
cash provided by operations the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating and discretionary spending requirements 
free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures increased to billion in  compared with million in cash provided by operations was reduced by approximately million of made for you incentive payments in and million of us franchisee security deposit refunds in cash provided by operations  along with other sources of cash such as borrowings  was used for capital expenditures  share repurchase  dividends and debt repayments 
cash provided by operations dollars in millions cash provided by operations    free cash flow  cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures cash provided by operations as a percent of average total debt in addition to its free cash flow  the company can meet short term needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements 
accordingly  the company strategically and purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio 
at year end financings and market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
mcdonald s strives to minimize these risks by employing established risk management policies and procedures and by financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
see summary of significant accounting policies on page for additional information regarding our use of financial instruments and the impact of the new accounting standard on derivatives 
the company uses major capital markets and various techniques to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
for example  currency exchange agreements in conjunction with borrowings help obtain desired currencies at attractive rates and maturities 
interest rate exchange agreements effectively convert fixed rate to floating rate debt  or vice versa 
the company also manages the level of fixed rate debt to take advantage of changes in interest rates 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on net income and shareholders equity 
the high proportion of foreign dominated debt has lessened the impact of recently rising us interest rates 
total foreign denominated debt  including the effects of currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
debt highlights as a percent fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt weighted average annual interest rate of total debt foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt total debt as a percent of total capitalization total debt and total shareholders equity moody s and standard poor s have rated mcdonald s debt aa and aa  respectively  since duff phelps began rating the debt in and currently rates it aa 
a strong rating is important to the company because of its global development plans 
the company has not experienced  and does not expect to experience  difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
at year end  the company and its subsidiaries had billion available under committed line of credit agreements and billion under shelf registrations for future debt issuance 
in early  the company reduced the amount available under committed line of credit agreements to billion and issued british pounds sterling medium term notes under one of the shelf registrations  in the equivalent of million at a rate of  due the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
the company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on reported results and to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the us in addition  where practical  mcdonald s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges  and the company typically finances in local currencies  creating economic hedges 
the company s exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
at year end and  assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in us dollars 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency exposures in millions of us dollars euro based currencies   canadian dollars british pounds sterling australian dollars brazilian reais hong kong dollars does not reflect the million debt issuance in february the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from year end levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from year end levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
total shareholders equity the company uses free cash flow and debt capacity to repurchase shares  as we believe this enhances shareholder value 
over the past years  the company has invested billion to buy back million shares at an average price of approximately  while maintaining a strong equity base 
at year end  the company held million shares in treasury with a market value of billion 
in september  the company announced plans to repurchase billion of its common stock by year end between september and december  we purchased million shares for approximately billion  including million shares for million in the company sells common equity put options in connection with our share repurchase program and receives premiums for these options  which reduce the overall cost of treasury stock purchases 
during  the company sold million common equity put options  of which million were outstanding at december  premiums received of million in were reflected in shareholders equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased 
during february  million common equity put options were exercised for million 
the remaining options expire at various dates through february  with exercise prices between and 
given the company s returns on equity and assets  management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of earnings back into the business and use free cash flow for share repurchase 
accordingly  the common stock dividend yield is modest 
however  the company has paid dividends on our common stock for consecutive years through and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year 
future dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders  profitability expectations and financing needs 
in november  the company announced that it intends to pay cash dividends on an annual  instead of quarterly  basis beginning in future dividends declared at the discretion of the company s board of directors will be paid annually in december 
returns operating income is used to compute return on average assets  while net income less preferred stock dividends if applicable is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
returns on assets and equity as a percent return on average assets return on average common equity excluding made for you costs and the special charge 
including made for you costs and the special charge  return on average assets was and return on average common equity was 
the increases in the and returns were due to strong operating results  enhanced by the company s continued focus on more efficient capital deployment 
this included a more selective site selection process  the us new building program that began in and the use of free cash flow for share repurchase 
also contributing to the increase in the return on average common equity was the significant increase in the amount of common equity put options entered into during the year  which reduced average common equity 
other matters effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made cheaper by inflation 
in hyperinflationary markets  menu board prices are typically adjusted to keep pace with inflation  mitigating the effect on reported results 
year in  the company completed all necessary modifications  testing and replacements of significant systems to become year compliant 
as a result of the efforts undertaken  the company experienced no major disruptions in significant information technology and noninformation technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
in addition  the company did not experience any significant operational or financial difficulties resulting from year issues related to owner operators or third party service providers 
the company will continue to monitor its computer applications throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
the year costs incurred by the company did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
euro conversion on january   member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is trading on currency exchanges and may be used in certain transactions such as electronic payments 
beginning in january  new euro denominated notes and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions between the member countries  which for mcdonald s primarily consist of payments to suppliers 
in addition  as we use foreign denominated debt and derivatives to meet our financing requirements and to minimize our foreign currency risks  certain of these financial instruments are denominated in euros 
mcdonald s has restaurants located in all member countries and has been preparing for the introduction of the euro for the past several years 
the company is currently addressing the issues involved with the new currency  which include converting information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  recalibrating derivatives and other financial instruments and revising processes for preparing accounting and taxation records 
based on the work to date  the company does not believe the euro conversion will have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows
