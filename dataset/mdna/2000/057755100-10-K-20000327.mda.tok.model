item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income and maturing investments 
the company generally experiences positive cash flow resulting from the fact that premiums are collected on insurance policies in advance of the disbursement of funds in payment of claims 
operating costs of the insurance subsidiaries  other than loss and loss expense payments and commissions paid to the parent company  generally average between and of premiums earned on a consolidated basis and the remaining amount is available for investment for varying periods of time depending on the type of insurance coverage provided 
during extended periods of declining premium volume  however  operating cash flows may turn negative as loss settlements exceed net premium revenue and receipts of investment income 
for several years  the company s investment philosophy has emphasized the purchase of short term bonds with maximum quality and liquidity 
as interest rates have remained relatively low and yield curves have been essentially flat in recent years  the company has not committed funds to longer term fixed maturity investments 
the average life of the company s bond and short term investment portfolio was years and years for and  respectively 
the company also remains an active participant in the equity securities market 
investments made by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders 
the company s assets at december  included million in short term investments which are readily convertible to cash without market penalty and an additional million of fixed maturity investments maturing in less than one year 
the company believes that these liquid investments  plus the expected cash flow from current operations  are more than sufficient to provide for projected claim payments and operating cost demands 
in addition  the company s reinsurance program is structured to avoid serious cash drains that might accompany catastrophic losses 
in the event competitive conditions continue to produce inadequate rates and the company chooses to further reduce volume  the company believes that the liquidity of its investment portfolio would permit it to continue to pay claims as settlements are reached without requiring the disposal of investments at a loss  regardless of interest rates in effect at the time 
net premiums written by the company s us insurance subsidiaries for were approximately of the combined statutory surplus of these subsidiaries 
premium writings of to of surplus are generally considered acceptable by regulatory authorities 
further  the statutory capital of each of the insurance subsidiaries substantially exceeds minimum risk based capital requirements set by the national association of insurance commissioners 
accordingly  the company has the ability to significantly increase its business without seeking additional capital to meet statutory guidelines 
shareholders equity decreased to million at december   from million at december   due predominantly to million in treasury share purchases 
the change in shareholders equity also included a million decline in unrealized net gains on investments and million of cash dividends to shareholders 
book value per common share outstanding increased to at december  from per share at december as more fully discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  at december   million  or of shareholders equity  represented net assets of the company s insurance subsidiaries which  at that time  could not be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company due to statutory restrictions on the allowable transfers 
however  management believes that these restrictions pose no material liquidity concerns for the company 
the financial strength and stability of the subsidiaries permit ready access by the parent company to short term and long term sources of credit 
the parent company had cash and marketable investments of approximately million at december  results of operations compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet trucking s independent contractor program of million from direct premium writings from small and large trucking fleet risks also increased by million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a small decrease in the company s private passenger automobile business where competitive pressures have increased 
increases in independent contractor premiums resulted from the addition of new accounts and volume increases on existing accounts 
large fleet trucking volume increases resulted primarily from the addition of new accounts and small fleet trucking premium increases were due primarily to geographic expansion 
premiums assumed from other reinsurers decreased by million to million during this decrease is due to non renewal of the company s participation in voluntary property catastrophe retrocession pools during as pricing in this market continued to weaken 
premiums ceded to reinsurers increased million during to million 
the percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written increased to for from for  as the company s new reinsurance agreements for its fleet trucking products  effective june   were inforce for the full year 
the new treaties provide for the company to cede larger portions of its premium as well as the underlying risk 
after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased 
to million for from million for net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products increased by million  including million for small fleet trucking 
premiums earned from private passenger autobobile increased by million 
the above increases were offset by a million decrease in voluntary reinsurance assumed premium during net investment income decreased by 
million 
during due to lower average invested assets while overall pre tax yields remained relatively unchanged from the average pre tax yield on invested assets was for both and and after tax yields also remained unchanged at 
investment expenses  which are netted directly against income  were relatively unchanged in and were of gross investment income for both and realized net capital gains were million in compared to million for the current year net gain consisted of gains on equity securities and other investments of million and 
million  respectively  and losses on fixed maturities of million 
losses and loss expenses incurred during increased million to million 
the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio was compared to for the increase in the loss and loss expense ratio is primarily attributable to incurred loss development on discontinued products and residual market participation along with growth in the company s small trucking fleet program  all of which is measured against a relatively unchanged consolidated premium base 
changes in the company s remaining products were individually insignificant 
because of the high limits provided by the company to its insureds  the length of time required to settle larger  more complex claims and the volatility of the trucking liability insurance business  the company believes it is important to have a high degree of comfort in its reserving process 
as claims are settled in years subsequent to their occurrence  the company s claim handling process has  historically  tended to produce savings from the reserves provided 
the company believes that favorable loss developments in recent years may be attributable  at least in part  to changes in trucking safety in general resulting from the implementation of the national commercial driver license  mandatory drug testing and an increased awareness by trucking companies of the cost of unsafe operations 
it is further believed that the company s selection techniques  minimum safety standards and claims handling have also contributed to this favorable loss experience 
however  due to the aforementioned changes in the company s reinsurance structure for its large trucking fleets  whereby a smaller portion of the risk is retained  the impact of future loss developments on the loss and loss expense ratios may not be consistent with prior years 
other operating expenses for  before credits for allowances from reinsurers  increased million to million 
personnel related expenses  including amounts allocated to loss expenses and investment income  increased million from personnel expense for was higher primarily as the result of accruals for equity appreciation rights  which represent a broad based employee incentive program which is tied to changes in the company s book value  in addition to regular annual payroll increases 
direct commission expense decreased 
million as the result of the decline in premiums from voluntary reinsurance assumed  partially offset by increases in premiums from sagamore s small fleet and small business workers compensation products 
ceding commission allowances from reinsurers increased million resulting from new reinsurance agreements covering protective s fleet trucking business

while it is not possible to precisely isolate yk expenditures from those for ongoing development of current product lines  management believes that amounts spent during for yk related issues were higher than expenditures during the effective federal tax rate for consolidated operations for was 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt investment income 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  net income from consolidated operations for was million compared to million for diluted earnings per share increased to in from in due primarily to the increase in realized gains on investments 
diluted earnings per share from operations before realized gains on investments was in compared to in compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in nonstandard private passenger automobile business of million from direct premium writings from small trucking fleet risks and fleet trucking s independent contractor program also increased by million and million  respectively 
the new small business workers compensation program also generated 
million in new premium during these increases were partially offset by decreases in the remainder of the company s trucking related products 
market conditions for the company s large and medium fleet trucking products continued to be competitive during  resulting in further downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  favorable claims development from expired retrospectively rated workers compensation policies reduced direct premium by million in premium writings from reinsurance assumed decreased by million to million during million of this decrease is due to the company not renewing it s participation in an excess facultative program due to unfavorable experience 
premiums assumed from voluntary property catastrophe retrocession pools were also lower during as the result of reductions in the company s shares in these pools during  as well as decreases in gross pool revenues 
premium writings ceded to reinsurers increased million during to million 
the percentage of premiums ceded to direct premiums written increased to for from for  as the company entered into new reinsurance agreements for its fleet trucking products  effective june   whereby it ceded more premiums and retained less risk 
reinsurance retentions were also decreased for the company s small fleet trucking products with no material impact on premium ceded 
after giving effect to changes in unearned premiums  net premiums earned increased to million for from for net premiums earned from all trucking related insurance products  including small fleet trucking  decreased by million

the consolidated loss and loss expense ratio was compared to for losses and loss expenses incurred for included adverse development on environmental liability claims of million relating to policies written in the s 
the company has established provisions for incurred but not reported environmental losses at december  which are believed to be sufficient to cover all anticipated exposure

in federal income tax considerations the liability method is used in accounting for federal income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for deferred federal income tax was based on items of income and expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference originated 
net deferred tax liabilities of million and million were recorded at december  and  respectively 
the net deferred tax liability at december  included million in special tax deposits covered under section of the internal revenue code  as explained in the following paragraph  which compares to million in special tax deposits at december  adjusted for the special deposits  a net deferred tax liability of million was recorded at december  compared to a net deferred tax liability of million at december  the decrease in deferred federal taxes payable is primarily attributable to changes in unrealized capital gains in the investment portfolio 
a provision in the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of created a mechanism which would allow for a recognizable deferred tax asset specifically for property and casualty loss reserves discounted for tax purposes 
adopted as section of the internal revenue code  this provision allows an insurer to take a special tax deduction equal to the discount on post accident year loss and loss expense reserves while making special estimated tax payments equal to the amount of the tax benefit derived from the special deduction 
the special estimated tax payments can be carried forward for fifteen years to offset taxes arising from decreases in the special deduction and can be treated as regular estimated payments or refunded at the end of the carryforward period 
based upon the concerns regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets  the company adopted the provisions of section for all tax years and subsequent and has taken deductions for the entire amount of discount on post loss reserves 
as mentioned above  special section estimated tax deposits totaling million have been paid in connection with this election 
forward looking information any forward looking statements in this report  including without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources  are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitation the following i the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the company  ii the company s business is highly competitive and the entrance of new competitors into or the expansion of the operations by existing competitors in the company s markets and other changes in the market for insurance products could adversely affect the company s plans and results of operations  and iii other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
impact of the year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its preparedness plans for the year in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
costs associated with the year effort were not significant to the company s operations during the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
market risk the company operates solely within the property and casualty insurance industry and  accordingly  has significant invested assets which are exposed to various market risks 
these market risks relate to interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency translation and equities market prices 
all of the company s invested assets are classified as available for sale and are listed as such in the enclosed consolidated financial statements in note b 
the most significant of the three identified market risks relates to prices in the equities market 
though not the largest category of the company s invested assets  equity securities have the greatest potential for short term price fluctuation 
the market value of the company s equity positions at december  was million or approximately of invested assets  including money market instruments classified as cash 
funds invested in the equities market are not considered to be assets necessary for the company to conduct its daily operations and  therefore  can be committed for extended periods of time 
the long term nature of the company s equity investments allows it to invest in positions where ultimate value  and not short term market fluctuations  are the most important feature 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio totaled million at december  and is heavily weighted toward u 
s 
government and government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities 
over of this portfolio matures within years and the average life of the company s fixed maturity investments is approximately years 
although the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its fixed maturity investments  given the anticipated duration of the company s liabilities principally insurance loss and loss expense reserves relative to maturities  even a to basis point increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct daily operations or to meet its obligations 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
impact of inflation to the extent possible  the company attempts to recover the costs of inflation by increasing the premiums it charges 
a majority of the company s premiums are charged as a percentage of an insured s gross revenue or payroll 
as these charging bases increase with inflation  so does premium 
the remaining premium rates charged are adjustable only at periodic intervals and often require state regulatory approval 
such periodic increases in premium rates may lag far behind cost increases 
to the extent inflation influences yields on investments  the company is also affected 
the company maintains a sizable portion of its investment portfolio in short term instruments and changes in current market interest rates correspondingly affect yields on these investments 
further  as inflation affects current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation must also be considered by the company in the creation and review of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses
