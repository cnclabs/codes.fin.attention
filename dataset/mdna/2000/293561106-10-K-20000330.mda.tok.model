wholesale energy operations and services enron s wholesale business enron wholesale includes its wholesale energy businesses around the world  as well as its emerging broadband services business 
enron wholesale operates in developed markets such as north america and europe  as well as developing or newly deregulating markets including south america  india and japan 
enron builds its wholesale businesses through the creation of networks involving asset ownership  contractual access to third party assets and market making activities 
each market in which enron wholesale operates utilizes these components in a slightly different manner and is at a different stage of development 
this network strategy has enabled enron wholesale to establish a leading position in its markets 
these activities are categorized into two business lines a commodity sales and services and b assets and investments 
often these activities are integrated into a bundled product offering for enron s customers 
enron wholesale manages its portfolio of contracts and assets in order to maximize value  minimize the associated risks and provide overall liquidity 
in doing so  enron wholesale uses portfolio and risk management disciplines  including offsetting or hedging transactions  to manage exposures to market price movements commodities  interest rates  foreign currencies and equities 
additionally  enron wholesale manages its liquidity and exposure to third party credit risk through monetization of its contract portfolio or third party insurance contracts 
enron wholesale also sells interests in certain investments and other assets to improve liquidity and overall return 
the following table reflects ibit for each business line in millions commodity sales and services assets and investments unallocated expenses income before interest  minority interests and taxes  the following discussion analyzes the contributions to ibit for each business line 
commodity sales and services 
enron wholesale provides reliable commodity delivery and predictable pricing to its customers through forward contracts 
this market making activity includes the purchase  sale  marketing and delivery of natural gas  electricity  liquids and other commodities  as well as the management of enron wholesale s own portfolio of contracts 
enron wholesale s market making activity is facilitated through a network of capabilities including asset ownership 
accordingly  certain assets involved in the delivery of these services are included in this business such as intrastate natural gas pipelines  power plants and gas storage facilities 
enron wholesale markets  transports and provides energy commodities as reflected in the following table including intercompany amounts physical volumes bbtue d a b gas united states    canada    europe   other transport volumes total gas volumes    crude oil   liquids electricity c    total physical volumes bbtue d    electricity volumes marketed thousand mwh united states    europe  other total    financial settlements notional  bbtue d    a billion british thermal units equivalent per day 
b includes third party transactions by enron energy services 
c represents electricity volumes marketed  converted to bbtue d 
earnings from commodity sales and services increased million in as compared to reflecting strong results from the intermediation businesses in both north america and europe  which include delivery of energy commodities and associated risk management products 
enron wholesale strengthened its market share leadership position in the north american energy markets and continued to expand its presence in europe  particularly on the continent where wholesale markets began deregulation in early enron wholesale also successfully managed its overall portfolio of contracts  particularly in minimizing credit exposures utilizing third party contracts 
new product offerings in coal and pulp and paper markets also added favorably to the results 
in late  enron wholesale launched an internet based ecommerce system  enrononline  which allows wholesale customers to view enron s real time pricing and to complete commodity transactions with enron as principal  with no direct interaction 
this capability has positively impacted transaction levels 
the earnings from commodity sales and services operations increased in as compared to  reflecting growing transaction levels during the period 
sales in north america increased significantly due to increased power marketing activities over increase in volumes  along with new and restructured long term contracts 
european activity declined during the year  primarily reflecting the effect of regulatory actions in the united kingdom that impacted the market for natural gas 
assets and investments 
enron s wholesale businesses make investments in various energy and communications related assets as a part of its network strategy 
enron wholesale either purchases the asset from a third party or develops and constructs the asset 
in most cases  enron wholesale operates and manages such assets 
earnings from these investments principally result from operations of the assets or sales of ownership interests 
additionally  enron wholesale invests in debt and equity securities of energy and communications related businesses  which may also utilize enron wholesale s products and services 
with these merchant investments  enron s influence is much more limited relative to assets enron develops or constructs 
earnings from these activities result from changes in the market value of the security 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these investments 
earnings from assets and investments increased million in as compared to during  earnings from enron wholesale s energy related assets increased  reflecting the operation of the dabhol power plant in india  ownership in elektro eletricidade e servicos sa elektro  a brazilian electric utility see note to the consolidated financial statements and assets in various other developing markets 
enron wholesale s merchant investments increased in value during the year due to the expansion into certain communications investments  partially offset by a decline in the value of certain energy investments 
in addition  enron wholesale s earnings increased due to activities related to building and optimizing its broadband fiber network  while gains on sales of energy assets declined 
earnings from assets and investments increased in as compared to this increase reflects earnings from the sale of interests in certain energy assets including power projects in puerto rico  turkey  italy and the united kingdom  from which enron wholesale realized the value created during the development and construction phases 
increased development costs in emerging markets and lower earnings from merchant investments partially offset such increase 
some of these transactions involved securitizations in which enron retained certain interests associated with the underlying assets 
unallocated expenses 
net unallocated expenses include rent  systems expenses and other support group costs 
outlook enron wholesale plans to continue to expand its networks in each of its key energy markets  as well as the market for broadband services 
worldwide energy markets continue to grow as governments implement deregulation or privatization plans 
the market for broadband services is expected to increase significantly as demand increases for high bandwidth applications such as video 
enron will continue to purchase or develop selected assets to expand its networks  as well as grow its portfolio of contracts providing access to third party assets 
the combination of growing markets and enron wholesale s highly developed market making skills should continue to enhance market opportunities globally for enron over the next several years 
as a result  enron anticipates continued growth in enron wholesale during in the commodity sales and services business  volumes are expected to continue to increase as enron wholesale increases its transaction volume in the growing unregulated us power market and in the rapidly expanding european gas and power markets 
in addition  enrononline is expected to significantly add to transaction volume and profit opportunities in the coming year 
in the assets and investments business  enron wholesale expects to continue to benefit from opportunities related to its assets and investments  including sales or restructurings of appreciated investments  and in providing capital to energy intensive customers 
equity earnings from operations are expected to increase as a result of commencement of commercial operations of new power plants and pipeline projects in early at december   enron wholesale s domestic and international projects under construction included approximately  miles of pipelines and eleven power plants with a combined capacity of approximately  megawatts  in which enron owns various interests 
earnings from enron wholesale are dependent on the origination and completion of transactions  some of which are individually significant and which are impacted by market conditions  the regulatory environment and customer relationships 
enron wholesale s transactions have historically been based on a diverse product portfolio  providing a solid base of earnings 
enron s strengths  including its ability to identify and respond to customer needs  access to extensive physical assets and its integrated product offerings  are important drivers of the expected continued earnings growth 
in addition  significant earnings are expected from enron wholesale s commodity portfolio and investments  which are subject to market fluctuations 
external factors  such as the amount of volatility in market prices  impact the earnings opportunity associated with enron wholesale s business 
risk related to these activities is managed using naturally offsetting transactions and hedge transactions 
the effectiveness of enron s risk management activities can have a material impact on future earnings 
see financial risk management for a discussion of market risk related to enron wholesale

year a year problem was anticipated which could have resulted from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the use of two digits was a common practice for decades when computer storage and processing was much more expensive than today 
when computer systems must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive features may recognize a date represented by as the year instead of the year problem has caused no material disruption to enron s mission critical facilities or operations  and resulted in no material costs 
enron will remain vigilant for year related problems that may yet occur due to hidden defects in computer hardware or software at enron or enron s mission critical external entities 
enron anticipates that the year problem will not create material disruptions to its mission critical facilities or operations  and will not create material costs

item a 
financial risk management enron wholesale offers price risk management services primarily related to commodities associated with the energy sector natural gas  electricity  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
energy services also offers price risk management services to its commercial and industrial customers 
these services are provided through a variety of financial instruments including forward contracts  which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity  swap agreements  which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  options and other contractual arrangements 
interest rate risks and foreign currency risks associated with the fair value of its energy commodities portfolio are managed using a variety of financial instruments  including financial futures  swaps and options 
enron s other businesses also enter into forwards  swaps and other contracts primarily for the purpose of hedging the impact of market fluctuations on assets  liabilities  production or other contractual commitments 
changes in the market value of these hedge transactions are deferred until the gain or loss is recognized on the hedged item 
enron manages market risk on a portfolio basis  subject to parameters established by its board of directors 
market risks are monitored by an independent risk control group operating separately from the units that create or actively manage these risk exposures to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
enron s fixed price commodity contract portfolio is typically balanced to within an annual average of of the total notional physical and financial transaction volumes marketed 
market risk the use of financial instruments by enron s businesses may expose enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for enron wholesale s and energy services businesses  the major market risks are discussed below commodity price risk 
commodity price risk is a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers as well as owning and operating production facilities 
as discussed above  enron actively manages this risk on a portfolio basis to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
forwards  futures  swaps and options are utilized to manage enron s consolidated exposure to price fluctuations related to production from its production facilities 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is also a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers and having variable rate debt obligations  as changing interest rates impact the discounted value of future cash flows 
enron utilizes forwards  futures  swaps and options to manage its interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the result of enron s international operations and price risk management services provided to its worldwide customer base 
the primary purpose of enron s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency purchase and sale transactions 
enron primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts  futures and purchased options to manage enron s risk profile 
equity risk 
equity risk arises primarily from the assets and investments operations of enron wholesale  which provides capital to customers through equity participations in various investment activities 
enron generally manages this risk by hedging specific investments using futures  forwards  swaps and options 
enron evaluates  measures and manages the market risk in its investments on a daily basis utilizing value at risk and other methodologies 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse markets and products 
the use of these methodologies requires a number of key assumptions including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses  the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the value at risk methodologies  including liquidity risk and event risk 
value at risk represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its investments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and no change in positions 
value at risk is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
value at risk enron has performed an entity wide value at risk analysis of virtually all of enron s financial assets and liabilities 
value at risk incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of enron s investments  including commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and associated volatilities  as well as correlation within and across these variables 
enron estimates value at risk commodity  interest rate and foreign exchange exposures using a model based on monte carlo simulation of delta gamma positions which captures a significant portion of the exposure related to option positions 
the value at risk for equity exposure discussed above is based on jp morgan s riskmetricst approach 
both value at risk methods utilize a one day holding period and a confidence level 
cross commodity correlations are used as appropriate 
the use of value at risk models allows management to aggregate risks across the company  compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk 
because of the inherent limitations to value at risk  including the use of delta gamma approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period and reliance on historical data to calibrate the models  enron relies on value at risk as only one component in its risk control process 
in addition to using value at risk measures  enron performs regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of sudden market moves on the value of its portfolios 
the results of the stress testing  along with the professional judgment of experienced business and risk managers  are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and capture additional market related risks  including volatility  liquidity and event  concentration and correlation risks 
the following table illustrates the value at risk for each component of market risk december  year ended december  high low in millions average a valuation a valuation a trading market risk commodity price b interest rate foreign currency exchange rate equity c non trading market risk d commodity price e interest rate foreign currency exchange rate equity a the average value presents a twelve month average of the month end values 
the high and low valuations for each market risk component represent the highest and lowest month end value during b in june  seasonal dynamics in the us power markets caused enron s value at risk to increase significantly 
c enron s equity trading market risk primarily relates to merchant activities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in value at risk in is due primarily to greater volatility in investments held throughout  increased levels of more volatile communications investments and further refinement of enron s value at risk model to allow the inclusion of certain partnership interests and other instruments for the first time 
d includes only the risk related to the financial instruments that serve as hedges and does not include the related underlying hedged item 
e enron s hedging activity decreased following the exchange and sale of enron s interest in eog see note to the consolidated financial statements
