liquidity and capital resources historically  boyds utilized its operating cash flow to support working capital and ongoing capital expenditures 
cash flow from operations decreased million  or  to million for the full year from million for the full year the cash flow decrease was primarily attributable to the decreases in net income  accrued taxes and interest payable  partially offset by increases in the amortization of the deferred tax asset  the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  a decrease in accounts receivable net and an increase in accrued expenses 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million  or  to million for the full year  from million for the full year the funds  realized primarily from the sale of boyds stock and from operations  were used to repay outstanding debt  the fees and expenses related to the stock sale  and for the repurchase of company stock 
boyds primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement  which includes a revolving credit facility 
boyds primary uses of cash are to fund working capital and to service debt 
in connection with the recapitalization discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  boyds issued senior subordinated notes due in an amount of million and entered into a credit agreement providing for a million senior secured term loan and a senior secured revolving credit facility providing for borrowings up to million 
on april   boyds repaid million of the notes  leaving a balance outstanding of million 
boyds has repaid million of the term loans under the credit agreement through december   leaving a balance outstanding of million 
boyds currently has no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
thus  the full amount available under the revolving credit facility will be available to fund the working capital requirements of boyds 
on may   boyds board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares of boyds common stock 
as of december   boyds had repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to this stock repurchase program for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
these repurchases were financed out of operating cash flow and approximately million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility which were subsequently repaid 
any future repurchases under this program are expected to be financed similarly 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum  equal to a margin over either a base rate or libor  at boyds option 
the revolving credit facility commitment will terminate seven years after the date of the initial funding of the credit agreement 
the term loans will be amortized over an eight year period with no amortization in the first two years 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and events of default  including substantial restrictions on boyds ability to declare dividends or make distributions 
the term loans are subject to mandatory prepayment with the proceeds of certain asset sales and a portion of boyds excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
boyds does not expect to incur significant capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
boyds does not incur significant capital expenditures due to its sourcing arrangements with suppliers 
management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving loan will provide adequate funds for boyds foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to boyds on acceptable terms or at all 
boyds ability to fund its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  to refinance indebtedness and to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements  depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond boyds control 
seasonality boyds does not have the significant seasonal variation in its orders that it believes is experienced by many other giftware and collectibles companies 
boyds receives orders throughout the year and generally ships merchandise out on a first in  first out basis 
approximately of orders are taken between november and april while approximately of orders are placed between may and october in anticipation of the holiday season 
boyds does not build a large receivables balance relative to sales because it typically does not offer its customers long payment terms or dating programs 
foreign exchange the dollar value of boyds assets abroad is not significant 
boyds sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  are not subject to changes in exchange rates 
boyds imports most of its products from manufacturers in china 
boyds costs could be adversely affected on a short term basis if the chinese renminbi appreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
conversely  its costs would be favorably affected on a short term basis if the chinese renminbi depreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
although boyds generally pays for its products in united states dollars  the cost of such products fluctuates with the value of the chinese renminbi 
in the future boyds may  from time to time  enter into foreign exchange contracts or prepay inventory purchases as a partial hedge against currency fluctuations 
differences between the amounts of such contracts and costs of specific material purchases are included in inventory and cost of sales 
boyds intends to manage foreign exchange risks to the extent appropriate 
year compliance some of boyds older computer programs for internal business systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs had time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this would have caused a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
prior to the end of  boyds completed the testing and replacement of its systems so they would function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total costs for the incremental work required were not significant  as all upgrades and system replacements were part of previously planned software and hardware upgrades 
at the time of the filing of this form k  boyds has not experienced any material problems with any of its systems related to dates in the year and beyond 
boyds has a project team that will continue to monitor all systems for potential year related issues 
inflation boyds does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operations
