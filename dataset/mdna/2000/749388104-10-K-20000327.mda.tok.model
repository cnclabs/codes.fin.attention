sales and expenses racing champions sales are recognized based upon transfer of title of product to customers 
racing champions does not sell its products on consignment and ordinarily accepts returns only for defective merchandise 
returns have historically not been significant 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products which they have purchased from racing champions  racing champions may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions 
these credits and other price concessions are evaluated and issued annually 
mass merchant retailers purchase racing champions products either in the united states or the united kingdom with credit terms ranging from to days or directly in hong kong with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
by acquiring the products in hong kong  many of racing champions retail customers are able to realize efficiencies with respect to cost and logistics in the distribution of the products to their retail locations 
because racing champions incurs significantly lower distribution and administrative costs with respect to direct shipments to customers from hong kong  a price discount of approximately to is granted 
as a result  hong kong shipments have lower gross profit margins than domestic shipments 
therefore  the annual fluctuations in the mix of domestic versus hong kong shipments will affect year to year comparability of net sales and gross profit margins 
however  racing champions believes that the operating income margin is comparable for hong kong shipments due to the saved distribution and administrative costs 
for the years ended december   and  hong kong shipments constituted  and  respectively  of net sales 
racing champions three largest expense categories are cost of sales  royalties and sales commissions 
cost of sales consists primarily of purchases of finished products from racing champions manufacturing suppliers

sales commissions ranging from to of net sales are paid quarterly to racing champions external sales representative organizations 
in  sales subject to commissions represented of total net sales 
at december   wheels had established reserves for doubtful accounts  returns and allowances of  during  it became apparent that a trading card set issued in late  crown jewels elite  had been improperly packed by wheels contract packer 
as a result  substantial quantities of that product which had been purchased by distributors were not fit for sale on a retail basis 
although wheels encouraged distributors to continue to sell the product  wheels accepted product returns and issued credits and price concessions 
wheels recognized that a significant portion of the improperly packaged card sets would eventually be returned 
also contributing to the need for an increased reserve for doubtful accounts  returns and allowances at december  was an overall weakness in the trading card industry which reduced the ability of wheels major customers to sell through to retail  thereby increasing the likelihood of returns or other credits 
several major customers experienced financial difficulties during the later part of  also causing wheels to increase its reserves accordingly
