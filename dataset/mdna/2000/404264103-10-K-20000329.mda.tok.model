hpsc cautions the reader  however  that such list of considerations may not be exhaustive 
hpsc undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
certain considerations dependence on funding sources  restrictive covenants 
the company s financing activities are capital intensive 
the company s revenues and profitability are related directly to the volume of financing contracts it originates 
to generate new financing contracts  the company requires access to substantial short and long term credit 
to date  the company s principal sources of funding for its financing transactions have been i a revolving credit facility with bankboston  as agent  for borrowing up to million the revolver  ii million in limited recourse revolving credit facilities with bravo and capital  iii fixed rate  full recourse term loans from several savings banks  iv specific recourse sales of financing contracts to savings banks and other purchasers  v the issuance of subordinated debt in and vi the company s internally generated revenues 
the company s revolver provides availability through may at which time the company plans to renew the facility for another year 
however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to renew or extend the revolver or to complete additional asset securitizations or to obtain other additional financing when needed and on acceptable terms 
the company would be adversely affected if it were unable to continue to secure sufficient and timely funding on acceptable terms 
the agreement governing the revolver the revolver agreement contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants  and failure to meet such covenants would result in a default under the revolver agreement 
moreover  the company s financing arrangements with bravo and capital and the savings banks described above incorporate the covenants and default provisions of the revolver agreement 
thus  any default under the revolver agreement will also trigger defaults under these other financing arrangements 
in addition  the indenture  dated march   between the company and state street bank and trust company  as trustee  relating to the company s subordinated debt  contains certain covenants that could restrict the company s access to funding 
securitization recourse  payment restriction and default risk 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company utilizes asset securitization transactions with wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries to seek fixed rate  matched term financing 
the company transfers financing contracts to these subsidiaries which  in turn  either pledge or sell the contracts to third parties 
the third parties recourse with regard to the pledge or sale is limited to the contracts sold to the subsidiary 
if the contract portfolio of these subsidiaries does not perform within certain guidelines  the subsidiaries must retain or trap any monthly cash distribution to which the company might otherwise be entitled 
this restriction on cash distributions could continue until the portfolio performance returns to acceptable levels as defined in the relevant agreements  which restriction could have a negative impact on the cash flow available to the company 
there can be no assurance that the portfolio performance would return to acceptable levels or that the payment restrictions would be removed 
customer credit risks 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in connection with payments due under financing contracts originated by the company whether or not such contracts have been securitized  held as collateral for loans to the company or sold at a level which the company deems sufficient to meet future estimated uncollectible receivables  based on an analysis of the delinquencies  problem accounts  and overall risks and probable losses associated with such contracts  together with a review of the company s historical credit loss experience 
there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate 
failure of the company s customers to make scheduled payments under their financing contracts could require the company to i make payments in connection with its recourse loan and asset sale transactions  ii lose its residual interest in any underlying equipment or iii forfeit collateral pledged as security for the company s limited recourse asset securitizations 
in addition  although the charge offs on the portfolio of the company were less than of the company s average net investment in leases and notes for  any increase in such losses or in the rate of payment defaults under the financing contracts originated by the company could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing  including its ability to complete additional asset securitizations and secured asset sales or loans 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or reduce its current level of credit losses 
competition 
the company operates in highly competitive markets 
the company competes for customers with a number of national  regional and local finance companies  including those which  like the company  specialize in financing for healthcare providers 
in addition  the company s competitors include those equipment manufacturers which finance the sale or lease of their products themselves  conventional leasing companies and other types of financial services companies such as commercial banks and savings and loan associations 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing and operational resources than the company 
moreover  the company s future profitability will be directly related to its ability to obtain capital funding at favorable funding rates as compared to the capital costs of its competitors 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include many larger  more established companies that have a lower cost of funds than the company and access to capital markets and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in its targeted markets 
equipment market risk 
the demand for the company s equipment financing services depends upon various factors not within its control 
these factors include general economic conditions  including the effects of recession or inflation  and fluctuations in supply and demand related to  among other things  i technological advances in and economic obsolescence of the equipment and ii government regulation of equipment and payment for healthcare services 
changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare and medicaid programs and other third party payors  such as insurance companies  as well as changes in the reimbursement policies of managed care organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  may also affect demand for medical and dental equipment and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in healthcare payment policies 
the increasing cost of medical care has brought about federal and state regulatory changes designed to limit governmental reimbursement of certain healthcare providers 
these changes include the enactment of fixed price reimbursement systems in which the rates of payment to hospitals  outpatient clinics and private individual and group practices for specific categories of care are determined in advance of treatment 
rising healthcare costs may also cause non governmental medical insurers  such as blue cross and blue shield associations and the growing number of self insured employers  to revise their reimbursement systems and policies governing the purchasing and leasing of medical and dental equipment 
alternative healthcare delivery systems  such as health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed care programs  have adopted similar cost containment measures 
other proposals to reform the united states healthcare system are considered from time to time 
these proposals could lead to increased government involvement in healthcare and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s customers 
healthcare providers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investment in medical and dental equipment 
future changes in the healthcare industry  including governmental regulation thereof  and the effect of such changes on the company s business cannot be predicted 
changes in payment or reimbursement programs could adversely affect the ability of the company s customers to satisfy their payment obligations to the company and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
interest rate risk 
except for approximately million of the company s financing contracts  which are at variable interest rates with no scheduled payments  the company s financing contracts require the company s customers to make payments at fixed interest rates for specified terms 
however  approximately million of the company s borrowings currently are subject to a variable interest rate 
consequently  an increase in interest rates  before the company is able to secure fixed rate  long term financing for such contracts or to generate higher rate financing contracts to compensate for the increased borrowing cost  could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to secure additional long term financing at favorable rates and to generate higher rate financing contracts is limited by many factors  including competition  market and general economic conditions and the company s financial condition 
residual value risk 
at the inception of its equipment leasing transactions  the company estimates what it believes will be the fair market value of the financed equipment at the end of the initial lease term and records that value typically of the initial purchase price on its balance sheet 
the company s results of operations depend  to some degree  upon its ability to realize these residual values as of december   the estimated residual value of equipment at the end of the lease term was approximately million  representing approximately of the company s total assets 
realization of residual values depends on many factors  several of which are not within the company s control  including  but not limited to  general market conditions at the time of the lease expiration  any unusual wear and tear on the equipment  the cost of comparable new equipment  the extent  if any  to which the equipment has become technologically or economically obsolete during the contract term  and the effects of any new government regulations 
if  upon the expiration of a lease contract  the company sells or refinances the underlying equipment and the amount realized is less than the original recorded residual value for such equipment  a loss reflecting the difference will be recorded on the company s books 
failure to realize aggregate recorded residual values could thus have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of receivables 
as part of the company s portfolio management strategy and as a source of funding of its operations  the company has sold selected pools of its lease contracts and notes receivable due in installments to a variety of savings banks and as part of both the bravo and capital securitization facilities 
each of these transactions is subject to certain covenants that require the company to i repurchase financing contracts from the bank and or make payments under certain circumstances  including the delinquency of the underlying debtor  and ii service the underlying financing contracts 
the company carries a reserve for each transaction in its allowance for losses and recognizes a gain that is included for accounting purposes in net revenues for the year in which the transaction is completed 
each of these transactions incorporates the covenants under the revolver as such covenants were in effect at the time the asset sale or loan agreement was consummated 
any default under the revolver may trigger a default under the savings bank agreements 
the company may enter into additional asset sale agreements in the future in order to manage its liquidity 
the level of reserves established by the company in relation to these sales may not prove to be adequate 
failure of the company to honor its repurchase and or payment commitments under these agreements is an event of default under the loan or asset sale agreements and under the revolver 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to sell its lease contracts and notes receivable or that the sales in the future will generate gain recognition that is comparable to that recognized in the past 
dependence on sales representatives 
the company is  and its growth and future revenues are  dependent in a large part upon i 
the ability of the company s sales representatives to establish new relationships  and maintain existing relationships  with equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers and with healthcare providers and other customers and ii 
the extent to which such relationships lead equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers to promote the company s financing services to potential purchasers of their equipment 
as of december   the company had field sales representatives and in house sales personnel 
although the company is not materially dependent upon any one sales representative  the loss of a group of sales representatives could  until appropriate replacements were obtained  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on current management 
the operations and future success of the company are dependent upon the continued efforts of the company s executive officers  two of whom are also directors of the company 
the loss of the services of any of these key executives could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  the company has generally experienced fluctuating quarterly revenues and earnings caused by varying portfolio performance and operating and interest costs 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that quarterly comparisons of the results of its operations during any fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that results for any one fiscal quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance
