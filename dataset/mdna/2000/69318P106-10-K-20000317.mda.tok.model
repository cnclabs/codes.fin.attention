net sales decreased to million for  from million for the decrease was due to lower net sales in the ic package interconnect product lines  which were negatively impacted by several factors in first  sales volume changes in this segment typically lag the semiconductor industry overall 
the worldwide slowdown in the semiconductor industry began to impact the company s shipments during the second half of although the industry began to show signs of a recovery during the second half of  the company s sales orders did not return to early levels 
also  in  certain key customers of the company exited segments of the semiconductor business while others lost market share to their competitors 
finally  the memory burn in sockets market experienced significant price pressure due to over capacity and an increasing emphasis on low cost  standardized products 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million or in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit declined to in from in the decline in dollar and percentage terms was due to lower sales volume  pricing pressure in certain segments of the ic package interconnect market and a shift in product mix which resulted in a higher percentage of industrial avionics net sales in as presented in the table above  industrial avionics net sales comprised of total net sales in as compared with in operating expenses 
operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses and costs of product development 
operating expenses decreased by million to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in the decrease in was the result of actions taken to reduce expenses in response to lower sales volume

net sales increased to million for  from million for net sales in the industrial avionic product lines increased  to million 
the avionics portion of the industrial avionic business segment showed the largest increase  with an overall growth from the ic package interconnect product lines grew more than to million from million  which is the direct result of the acquisition of wells electronics

provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was due to the application of the effective tax rates for each of the state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 
specifically  wells cti kk  the japanese subsidiary of wells cti  had an effective tax rate of for incomplete technology update the acquired in process research and development ipr d which was expensed in in connection with the wells acquisition related to in process burn in socket designs and manufacturing process for various next generation high density ic package types 
more specifically  there were six projects for dual sided surface mount so packages  six for chip scale packages csp  three for lan grid array lga  two for ball grid array bga  two for test sockets and one for a miscellaneous package 
of the six so projects  four remain active and two were abandoned in of the six csp projects  three remain active  two were postponed and one was abandoned in of the three lga projects  one remains active and two were abandoned in of the two bga projects  both were abandoned in of the two test socket projects and the one miscellaneous package project  one remains active and two were abandoned in regarding the active projects as a whole  an additional  and  in capital costs were expended in and  respectively 
for the active projects as a whole  net sales of million and  were generated in and  respectively 
no additional projects other than the ones abandoned in were abandoned in failure to successfully develop the ipr d projects would negatively impact the company s future performance and its ability to compete in the burn in socket market 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in these funds were sufficient to meet working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which consist primarily of purchased tooling and equipment required to support the company s business 
the amount of these anticipated capital expenditures will frequently change based on future changes in business plans and conditions of the company and changes in economic conditions 
in december  the company obtained a senior credit facility for million from fleet national bank and other lenders the senior credit facility to finance in part the wells acquisition 
the senior credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company 
in conjunction with the senior credit facility  pcd and wells cti formerly wells electronics  inc each entered into a stock pledge agreement with fleet and the other lenders pledging all or substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries of pcd and wells cti 
each of pcd  wells cti and certain of their subsidiaries also entered into a security agreement and certain other collateral or conditional assignments of assets with fleet and other lenders 
in august  the company renegotiated the senior credit facility 
as a result  the interest rate premium of basis points charged on approximately million of the senior credit facility was eliminated 
according to its terms  the re negotiated senior credit facility will terminate on or before december  at december  and  borrowings of million and million were outstanding under the senior credit facility at weighted average interest rates of and  respectively 
the agreement governing the senior credit facility contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
among the operating covenants are restrictions that the company i must maintain john l 
dwight  jr 
as chief executive officer of the company or obtain the consent of the lenders under the senior credit facility to any replacement of mr 
dwight  ii may not  without the prior consent of such lender  acquire the assets of or ownership interest in  or merge with other companies  and iii may not  without the prior consent of such lenders  pay cash dividends 
the senior credit facility also requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants  including minimum ebitda  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum quick ratio  maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda  maximum ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money to ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures  during the term of the senior credit facility 
the company has experienced difficulty meeting all of the covenants under its senior credit facility 
accordingly  in september  certain covenants were amended by agreement between the company and its lenders 
in march  the company obtained from its lenders a waiver of compliance with certain covenants for the fourth quarter of at the same time  certain covenants were amended by agreement between the company and its lenders through june  in conjunction with the march agreement  the company issued warrants to its lenders covering a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are only exercisable if the company does not obtain at least million of subordinated debt or other capital infusions junior capital junior to loans under the senior credit facility by june   or by june  has not entered into definitive agreements permitting repayment of amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility by december  in addition  if the company does not obtain the junior capital by april   the company on may  would pay the lenders a fee of of the sum of the total outstanding principal balance under the term loan plus the revolving credit loan commitment 
the fee would be payable each quarter thereafter until the junior capital is obtained 
at december   the company was in compliance with or had obtained waivers for its debt covenants 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain compliance with its debt covenants in the future  and failure to meet such covenants would result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 
to avoid an event of default  the company would attempt to obtain waivers from its lenders  restructure the senior credit facility or secure alternative financing 
under these scenarios  there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions would satisfactory to the company or not disadvantageous to the company s stockholders 
in december  the company entered into a subordinated debenture and warrant purchase agreement purchase agreement with emerson electric co 
emerson  the company s largest stockholder 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the company issued to emerson a subordinated debenture debenture with a principal amount of million at an annual rate of interest of and a common stock purchase warrant the emerson warrant for the purchase of up to  shares of pcd common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in april  the company paid the principal  interest and prepayment penalty of  or  in full  resulting in an extraordinary charge to income of  net of taxes  in the second quarter of accordingly   shares of the emerson warrant terminated by the terms thereof  leaving the emerson warrant only exercisable for  shares of pcd common stock 
the emerson warrant expires on december  subject to the foregoing  the company believes its existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds generated from the company s operations  will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt payment requirements through because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company or not disadvantageous to the company s stockholders 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold used in plating  copper and brass used for contacts  and plastic material used in molding connector components 
in the past  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to similarly offset such cost increases in the future 
impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may interpret a date using in the year field as the year rather than the year this misinterpretation could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  an interruption of design or manufacturing functions or an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities until the problem is corrected 
the company identified its year risk in three categories internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  including embedded technology such as microcontrollers  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
internal it systems 
the company utilizes a significant number of information technology systems across its entire organization  including applications used in manufacturing  product development  financial business systems and various administrative functions 
since  the company has reviewed the year issue that encompassed operating and administrative areas of the company 
independent of the year issue and in order to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems across the company  pcd began a worldwide information technology systems replacement project with systems that use programs from oracle corporation oracle 
as of august   the company had successfully completed the implementation of this system in its united states operations and our japanese implementation had been temporarily suspended 
the current japanese systems are believed to be year compliant 
prior to the implementation of oracle  we found that our south bend  indiana location required an update to their internal it systems and this was achieved at a cost of approximately  the systems that required these updates were replaced by oracle 
during  the company applied the supplemental software microsoft developed for its microsoft windows nt and microsoft office applications at no additional cost to the company 
internal non it systems  including embedded technology 
during  the company completed its evaluation of all non it systems which included embedded technology such as microcontrollers  and had been in contact with all manufacturers of this equipment 
as a result of this evaluation  the company upgraded its payroll time clocks at the peabody  phoenix and south bend facilities at a cost of approximately  and also upgraded the peabody facility s telephone voice mail system at a cost of approximately  external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
during  the company contacted its material suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent of the company s vulnerability to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
these suppliers  service providers and contractors have incurred no problems with their own year issues that impacted the company 
item a 
market risk interest rate risk pcd is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with its variable rate term loan 
in order to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on earnings  pcd entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a notional amount of its variable rate term loan 
under the swap agreement  pcd pays a variable rate under libor and receives a fixed rate of on a notional amount of  the potential increase in the fair value of its term loan when adjusting for the interest rate swap paying at a fixed rate resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates was not material
