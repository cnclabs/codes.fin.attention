year many software applications and operational programs written in the past were not designed to recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the failure of such applications or systems to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or system failures  which could result in an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company instituted a year task force  which has initiated a comprehensive project to prepare its information technology it systems and non it systems for the year the project included identification and assessment of software  hardware and equipment that could potentially be affected by the year issue  remedial action and further testing procedures 
as of january   the company had spent approximately  in connection with addressing the year issue 
in assessing the risks presented by the year compliance issues  the task force identified potential worst case scenarios involving failure of the it and non it systems 
as of april  the company did not experience material disruption or other significant problems in its it and non it systems 
in addition  as of the same date  the company is not aware of any material year compliance issues relating to it and non it systems of third party business partners with which the company maintains material relationships 
in addition  the task force continues to monitor systems used by the company and maintains contact with third party businesses with which the company has material relationships with respect to year compliance and any year issues that may arise at a later date 
the task force will develop contingency plans relating to ongoing year issues at the time such issues are identified and such plans are deemed necessary 
based on the upgrades  remedial measures and the normal functioning to date of the it and non it systems  management does not foresee significant risks associated with its year compliance efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company or any third party business partners will not have ongoing year compliance issues that may have an adverse effect on the company 
acquisitions currently  the company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
however  the company continues to monitor acquisition opportunities 
accounting standards in  the fasb issued fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard  as amended  requires an entity to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements  to measure those instruments at fair value and to reflect the changes in fair value of those instruments as either components of comprehensive income or in net income  depending on the types of those instruments 
at this point  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of fas will significantly impact its financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  subsequently amended by sab no 
a 
this statement summarizes certain staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab provides additional guidance regarding when revenue is realized  earned and properly recognized 
the sab is required to be adopted for the quarter ended june  the company is evaluating sab and the effect it may have on the consolidated financial statements 
other matters major emphasis is being devoted to continuing last year s effort of sales expansion and transitioning out of the lower margin products into the higher technology  higher margin products 
however  due to market requirements  and maintaining solid customer relationships  company management elected to expend company resources to add value and begin to sell off much of the older  lower margin products 
the areas of focus lie with continuing the effort of selling off the older product line and introducing a wider array of products that incorporate both existing designs and new technology allowing the company to compete for a larger portion of cockpit panel space 
additionally  these new designs incorporate technology that enables a higher degree of automation in the production process  thereby increasing production efficiencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure for the company is interest rate risk 
the company does not currently utilize any financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its variable rate short term and long term borrowings 
a hypothetical increase in the company s weighted average interest rate would have increased the company s interest expense by approximately  based on the balance of variable rate debt outstanding at january
