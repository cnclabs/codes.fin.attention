item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we own and operate a diversified group of middle market industrial manufacturing and distribution businesses whose products include metal fasteners  large and heavy pressure vessels  high pressure industrial valves and related products and services 
operations are organized into four business segments i fastener manufacturing and distribution  ii heavy fabrication  iii valve manufacturing and repair now known as energy  and iv machine tool distribution 
our historical financial statements have been restated to include  for all periods presented  the results of operations from each of the companies that were acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the results of operations for companies acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method are included in our historical financial statements from the date of such acquisition 
since these purchase acquisitions were consummated at various times  the financial information contained herein with respect to each fiscal period does not fully reflect the results of operations that would have been achieved had these acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented or which may be achieved in the future 
in connection with each purchase acquisition  we have recorded goodwill to the extent the purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the specific assets acquired 
in june  we reached an agreement in principle with our senior lenders to amend our revolving line of credit agreement  including covenants we believe we will be able to comply with 
we expect that the new maturity date will be january  there can be no assurance that the agreement to amend our revolving line of credit will be executed 
although this proposed agreement will help to address our near term liquidity issues  we still have substantial debt obligations  including million in notes payable and revolving credit debt  which are currently in default 
therefore  we will continue to pursue various financing alternatives to meet our future short term liquidity needs 
we anticipate refinancing our debt facilities in  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance our debt or that we will be able to obtain terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist 
in addition to our current focus on refinancing our indebtedness  our business strategy is to increase the sales  cash flow and profitability of each business segment through a turnaround plan that was developed and implemented by the company to address the operational difficulties that occurred during and into this turnaround plan entails streamlining our operations and refocusing on our core competencies in the following three areas enhance revenue growth 
we believe that significant opportunities exist to enhance revenue growth in our business segments 
we plan to achieve this growth by i promoting cross selling opportunities across our customer base  ii identifying new applications and new markets for our existing products  production capabilities  and skill base  and iii acquiring companies that are strategic fits within our business segments 
to date in the fastener segment  we have integrated the sales of certain product lines across each of the related companies within this segment 
in the energy segment  rather than integrate the sales of our product lines across the companies within that segment  we have begun to integrate our customer base through the joint marketing of the individual companies products and services to the entire energy segment customer base 
over the next year  we will continue to expand on these efforts 
in the heavy fabrication segment  we have focused our efforts on developing and expanding our power generation customers in order to solidify our position in this burgeoning market 
we believe that our strong market positions within the niche markets we serve enhance our ability to effectively implement this aspect of the turnaround plan 
although historically much of our growth has been through acquisition  acquisitions will not be an area of emphasis until our turnaround plan has been fully executed and our financial performance has returned to historical levels 
eliminate waste 
we believe that significant opportunities exist to reduce or eliminate waste by i reducing working capital levels company wide through increased inventory turns and accelerated collection of receivables  ii selling non strategic assets that are not part of our core competencies  iii consolidating selected facilities  iv converting our present manufacturing processes to lean or more efficient manufacturing techniques  and v fully implementing our erp systems  which will allow our managers to obtain and use production information faster and more efficiently than before 
during the past sixteen months  we have i consolidated three of our facilities into other existing facilities  ii sold two non core business units  iii closed and liquidated four non core and unprofitable business units  iv completed the installation of two erp systems  v converted one plant from a traditional batch and queue operation to one that employs one piece flow or cellular production  and vi reduced inventory and receivables 
on a going forward basis  we intend to i consolidate an additional plant into an existing facility  ii sell three parcels of excess real estate  iii convert the distribution operations of our fastener segment to a common erp system  and iv continue the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
we plan to pursue similar measures when it is our best interest to do so 
develop employees 
we believe that employee development is an integral part of our turnaround plan 
across all of our businesses  our management  sales and operations teams have participated in numerous training and development programs that focus on management  sales  production  technical  safety and quality issues 
we believe that this training is a valuable tool in the development and enhancement of our employees skill sets and that we will continue to be rewarded for these efforts by a better trained  more knowledgeable and skilled workforce 
our results of operations are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries served by our customers  which in turn may be affected by other factors  including the level of economic activity in the us and foreign markets they serve 
the principal industries served by our clients are the automotive  home furnishings  petrochemical and oil and gas industries 
an economic slowdown in these industries could result in a decrease in demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our operating results 
during and into  oil and gas prices declined significantly  resulting in a decrease in the demand for our products and services that are used in the exploration and production of oil and gas 
exploration and production expenditures generally lag improvements in oil and gas prices  therefore  although oil and gas prices have improved during and into  we did not experience significant sales increases through the end of we have experienced increased sales and backlog in the first quarter of this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating statement data for each of our segments for each of the periods presented 
for the years ended december  sales fastener manufacturing and distribution    heavy fabrication   energy    machine tool distribution    cost of sales fastener manufacturing and distribution    heavy fabrication   energy    machine tool distribution    selling  general and administrative fastener manufacturing and distribution    heavy fabrication   energy    machine tool distribution    corporate    operating income loss    year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales 
on a consolidated basis  sales increased  or  in compared to sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ideal products and a b bolt in the third quarter of  which together added million in sales for compared to the increase was partially offset by a million aggregate sales decrease in our stud bolt and gasket operations  excluding a b bolt 
these operations were adversely effected by depressed activity in the oil and gas industries and a decline in spending in the refining and processing industries related to reductions in our customers profit margins that resulted from increases in their feedstock prices 
additionally  sales at our engineered fasteners operations  excluding ideal products  decreased by approximately million due to several factors i we lost two customers in that were customers in  one of these is again a customer in and the other  a lower margin customer  is not expected to return  ii a third customer s business was off significantly in compared with levels  though its business has recovered in to date  iii one of our engineered fasteners group companies serves the aircraft defense industry  which was weak in compared with  and iv the plant consolidations that took place in the fourth quarter of were somewhat disruptive at the affected plants during the actual transferring period 
sales for the heavy fabrication segment increased by  or  in compared to the heavy fabrication segment was formed july  with the acquisition of beaird industries 
under the purchase method of accounting  no sales were recorded relating to this segment prior to the second half of sales for increased million  or  compared to  inclusive of beaird s sales for the six month period prior to our ownership 
this sales increase  which was greater during the first half of the year  was based on a strategic decision to increase sales by expanding the range of products manufactured  primarily to the production of wind turbine towers 
beaird s primary contract for wind turbine towers required delivery of the towers on or before june   the mid point of our year 
the man hours associated with the completed wind turbine tower contract were not replaced during the remainder of additionally  a substantial percentage of this segment s revenues are derived from customers in the hydrocarbon processing industry 
because of the volatile oil feedstock prices during  the customers of this segment experienced a reduction in their profit margins and have materially reduced their capital spending 
in addition  heavy competitive pressure from overseas  particularly korean competition  has substantially reduced backlog 
due to the highly competitive market and the downturn in spending in one of the primary industries that we serve  we experienced a continued decline in revenues for this segment through the first quarter of however  at march   beaird s backlog had increased over december  sales for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to this sales decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales volume resulting from reductions in the worldwide rig count  continued caution regarding the long term hydrocarbon price environment  consolidation within the oil and gas industry and ongoing cost reduction efforts by oil and gas companies 
increasing worldwide demand for oil and gas coupled with declining production in many areas should support a more stable and favorable level of oil and gas prices in the future  resulting in increased exploration and production spending in and an improved demand for oilfield services 
sales for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or  as demand for machine tools declined in the energy industry due to the factors described in the energy segment disclosure above 
however  as the level of oil and gas prices has risen  sales of machine tools in this segment have increased in the first quarter of in comparison to previous quarters in in  we sold our export crating business  which had sales of  in we do not expect this transaction to have a material impact on the operating results of this segment 
cost of sales 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales increased  or  in compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was higher on a consolidated basis for a number of reasons 
the addition  in july  of the heavy fabrication segment  which typically has lower gross margins on its large contract business in comparison to our other segments  negatively impacted consolidated margins 
the energy segment  which typically has the highest margins of all of our segments  represented a smaller percentage of total sales excluding the heavy fabrication segment in compared to in 
additionally  margins in the energy segment  fastener segment and heavy fabrication segment decreased as competition for shrinking sales volumes in the energy related industries as discussed above placed downward pressure on sales prices 
cost of sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of the increased sales related to the addition of ideal products and a b bolt acquired in as described above 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for compared to in as a result of management and production changes  including planned reductions in inventory at two of our facilities 
additionally  several large sales took place during that had lower than average margins resulting from lower negotiated pricing  acceptable due to high volume 
in addition  cost of sales increased as a result the write off of inventory and tooling in the third and fourth quarters of of approximately million in the aggregate  primarily in association with the closing of our waterbury  ct and el paso  tx manufacturing facilities and our baytown  tx distribution facility 
cost of sales for the heavy fabrication segment increased  or  in compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to for gross margins were adversely affected by the significant increase in sales during a period in which we were unable to hire or retain adequate skilled workers due to the terms of our then existing union contract that covered most of beaird s workforce 
the union contract expired in november and the effectiveness of the workforce was further reduced during the period of contract renegotiation 
the backlog created during the negotiating process was still being cleared in the first half of and this  along with the increase in volume associated with the wind turbine tower product addition  resulted in higher than usual overtime and outsourcing costs 
margins also decreased as we were forced to lower our contract values in response to the competitive pressures mentioned in relation to the decline in sales 
cost of sales was also impacted by approximately million in expenses  primarily relating to warranty reserves in connection with the wind turbine tower contract and personnel severance and related charges 
cost of sales for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of the decrease in sales described above 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in and for the first half of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased because as sales decreased  our energy companies reduced their workforce and were able to eliminate overtime and outsourcing of production 
however  in the second half of  margins decreased in our oilfield related businesses  especially in parts and equipment sales  as competition in this market intensified due to the reasons discussed in relation to sales decreases 
in addition  we discontinued certain product offerings and wrote off related inventories at one of our subsidiaries resulting in charges of approximately million during the third and fourth quarters of cost of sales for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or  in compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in sales described above 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for compared to for sales related to export crating represented of total sales for compared to for gross margins have historically been higher for crating compared to machine sales 
the increase in margin due to sales mix was partially offset due to the incurrence of million in costs in the third and fourth quarters of related to the liquidation of inventory resulting from the closure of a used equipment sales subsidiary 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
on a consolidated basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in compared to the increase is primarily the result of i an increase of approximately million reflecting the fact that included a full year of expenses for beaird  ideal products and a b bolt  which were acquired during the third quarter of  ii approximately million in costs incurred due to the closing of the waterbury  ct  el paso  tx and baytown  tx facilities and the consolidation of the distribution and production into other facilities  along with severance costs associated with personnel reductions at various facilities  iii an expense of million for bad debt associated with the settlement of a dispute with a major customer in the heavy fabrication segment  iv professional fees related to productivity consultants in the amount of approximately million at our heavy fabrication segment  and v million in expenses incurred in relation to the high yield bond offering that was abandoned in the third quarter of in addition  we incurred fees associated with our refinancing efforts and increased provisions for bad debt at various subsidiaries due to the difficulties being experienced by our customers in the upstream energy market 
these increases were partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented as a result of the decrease in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the third quarter of as described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the heavy fabrication segment increased  or  in compared to only six months ended december  beaird was purchased effective july  
as mentioned above  the third and fourth quarters of included an aggregate of approximately million in expense for a provision for bad debt related to a customer dispute and million in professional fees associated with productivity consultants 
selling  general and administrative expenses without the provision and professional fees were comparable to the historical amounts for the full year of including expenses incurred by beaird prior to its acquisition by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to this was primarily as the result of the elimination of the salary and related expenses of the president of a company who resigned in connection with our acquisition of the company  which was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting  other personnel reductions  and reductions in other general and administrative expenses in response to decreases in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of cost reduction measures implemented due to the decreases in sales described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses at corporate increased  or  in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the million in expenses incurred in relation to the high yield bond offering that was abandoned in the third quarter of  and personnel additions and increases in professional fees associated with our continued refinancing efforts 
earnings losses from equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
on a consolidated basis  earnings from equity investments decreased  in compared to  primarily as a result of the company s investment in one affiliate  awr  which is engaged in the demolition of refineries and site remediation 
losses at this affiliate for include the recognition of anticipated losses to complete its contracts 
during  awr experienced a tank failure in addition to other problems at a job site  significantly increasing the cost of the site remediation 
additionally  we recognized a  loss on the liquidation of an investment in an affiliate  midland  that had been engaged in the recycling business 
midland and awr are equity investments of blastco 
interest expense 
on a consolidated basis  interest expense increased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of higher debt levels and interest rates 
interest income 
on a consolidated basis  interest income decreased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of lower cash balances being held in interest bearing accounts 
other income  net 
on a consolidated basis  other income  net  was approximately million for  primarily consisting of million in deferred gain recognition on the sale of a demolition contract  as well as rental income and gains and losses on the disposal of assets 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased  in compared to our effective tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate decreased as our federal income tax refunds received as a result of net operating loss carrybacks were at an actual rate which was less than  the increase in the valuation allowance  and because  despite net losses on a consolidated basis  we have tax expense at a state level 
net income loss 
on a consolidated basis  the company incurred a net loss of  in compared to net income of  in as a result of the foregoing factors 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales 
on a consolidated basis sales increased  or  in compared to sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  in compared to this increase was primarily as a result of the acquisitions of two companies in and the inclusion of a full year of operations of two companies in that were acquired in the heavy fabrication segment was formed july  with the acquisition of beaird 
under the purchase method of accounting  no sales were recorded relating to this segment prior to the second half of sales for the six months ended december  increased compared to the periods prior to the acquisition of beaird by approximately million or over the comparable period and million  or  over the six months ended june  sales increased based on a strategic decision to increase sales by expanding the range of products manufactured 
sales for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in sales at blastco attributable to the assignment of demolition contracts to awr  a company in which we have a interest 
our interest in the earnings from these contracts is included in the earnings from equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the decrease in sales at blastco was partially offset by an  increase in sales resulting from the inclusion of a full year of operations of two companies acquired during sales for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or  as demand for machine tools declined in the texas gulf coast region 
cost of sales 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales increased  or  in compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was higher on a consolidated basis primarily as a result of the addition in of the heavy fabrication segment  which typically has lower gross margins on its large contract business in comparison to our other segments 
cost of sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  in compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained relatively unchanged from in compared to in cost of sales for the heavy fabrication segment as a percentage of sales was for the six months ended december  gross margins were adversely affected by the significant increase in sales during a period in which we were unable to hire or retain adequate skilled workers due to the terms of our then existing union contract that covered most of beaird s workforce 
the union contract expired in november and the effectiveness of the workforce was further reduced during the period of contract renegotiation 
a new collective bargaining agreement was entered into in late november we believe that the terms of this agreement provide us with adequate flexibility to hire employees with the appropriate skills 
with the settlement of the contract and additional new hires  beaird experienced improvements in labor efficiency beginning in december however  due to the increase in backlog during the third and fourth quarters  the effects on gross margins in the fourth quarter of continued through the first six months of as beaird reduced its backlog 
cost of sales for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales at blastco described above  offset by the inclusion of a full year of operations of two companies acquired during cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to in cost of sales for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or  in compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in sales described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
on a consolidated basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or  primarily as the result of acquisitions in the third quarter of and the inclusion of a full year of operations of two companies in that were acquired in late selling  general and administrative expenses in the heavy fabrication segment for the six months ended december  relate to beaird s operations during the second half of and were comparable to the historical amounts prior to the acquisition of beaird 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy segment decreased  or  in compared to this was primarily as the result of the elimination of the salary and related expenses of the president of a company who resigned in connection with our acquisition of the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the machine tool distribution segment for did not change significantly from selling  general and administrative expenses at corporate increased  or  in compared to primarily as a result of personnel increases and increases in professional fees that have resulted from our growth 
earnings from equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
on a consolidated basis  earnings from equity investments increased  in compared to  primarily as a result of a full year of operations from our investment in awr  which had in process two contracts for demolition and site abatement and from our investment in of acquisition  lp of  which was entered into during interest expense 
on a consolidated basis  interest expense increased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of million in debt assumed or incurred in connection with acquisitions in interest income 
on a consolidated basis  interest income increased  or  in compared to interest income was earned primarily on the million raised in january in connection with our offer to class b warrant holders  which was held in interest bearing accounts prior to being used to repay debt and in acquisitions  as well as on notes receivable  which have increased since other income  net 
on a consolidated basis  other income  net  increased  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of recognition of income resulting from the sale of an interest in a demolition contract to one of our equity investees 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased  or  in compared to the effective tax rate was for and net income 
net income was  in compared to  in as a result of the foregoing factors 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a retained deficit of  and negative working capital of  as a result of  in notes payable and long term obligations classified as current liabilities 
at march   we had a retained deficit of  and negative working capital of  as a result of  in notes payable and long term obligations classified as current liabilities 
at december   we had short term debt of  current maturities of long term obligations of  long term obligations of  and shareholders equity of  historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for debt service  capital expenditures  working capital and acquisition financing  and our principal sources of liquidity and cash have been from cash flows from operations  borrowings under long term debt arrangements and issuances of equity securities 
we have financed acquisitions through bank borrowings  sales of equity and internally generated funds 
principal debt instruments 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed under our principal bank credit facility and debt instruments entered into or assumed in connection with acquisitions as well as other bank financings 
in june  we reached an agreement in principle to amend our credit agreement with our senior lenders  which represents million of debt  through january we are currently exploring various financing alternatives to meet our future liquidity needs 
we anticipate refinancing certain of our debt facilities in  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance such facilities or that we will be able to obtain terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist 
we have a million revolving line of credit with comerica bank texas  national bank of canada and hibernia bank the senior lenders  which expires in june we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants at each of the required quarterly reporting dates during we requested and received waivers from the senior lenders for the march  and june  reporting periods  however  we did not seek waivers for the reporting dates of september   december  or march  we were in violation of the credit agreement and although the senior lenders have not expressed the intent to call this obligation  the senior lenders retain the right to do so 
the principal amount of the credit facility is the lesser of million at december  or a defined borrowing base 
the credit facility bore interest at the prime rate of comerica at december  which was at december   and allows the borrowing of funds based on of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
at december   the borrowing capacity under the credit facility was million and availability was million 
at june   the borrowing capacity was million and availability was million 
we have held preliminary discussions with the senior lenders to modify the terms and covenants of the credit agreement 
we have reached an agreement in principle with the senior lenders that would i accelerate maturity to january   ii reduce the revolving credit line to the lesser of million or the defined borrowing base  iii increase the interest rate to prime plus  payable weekly and iv modify the financial covenants to require maintenance of minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to debt service ratio as well as require limitations on capital expenditures 
in addition  the senior lenders would waive all prior violations under the credit agreement 
however  no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully conclude the arrangement being considered 
in connection with the proposed credit agreement amendment  st 
james would be required to provide a million guaranty to the senior lenders in order to secure any over advances that may occur under the terms of the proposed credit agreement amendment 
in exchange for providing this guaranty  we plan to i issue to st 
james warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock at per share valued at  and ii forgive a million note receivable from sjcp 
in addition  if the guaranty is funded  we plan to issue to st 
james up to  warrants to acquire our common stock at per share valued at up to  depending on the amount of the funding 
we have a million note payable to enserco  llc enserco that became due on november  we were granted an extension of the due date through january  on january   we were unable to repay the amounts borrowed and defaulted on the note payable 
enserco has not called this note due  however  it retains the right to do so 
we have held preliminary discussions with enserco to modify the terms of the original note agreement  which include extending the due date 
although we have exchanged non binding term sheets with enserco that outline certain concepts that might be included in an amendment to the credit agreement in the future  including i increasing the principal amount to reflect unpaid accrued interest to date  ii extending the maturity date to february   and iii increasing the interest rate to a annual rate  payable at maturity  no agreement has been reached between the parties 
furthermore  no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully conclude the arrangement being considered 
we have a million term note with heller financial  inc heller  which expires on september  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants at each of the required quarterly reporting dates during we requested and received waivers from heller through the september  reporting period  however  we did not seek waivers for the reporting dates of december  or march  we are in violation of the credit agreement and although heller has not expressed the intent to call this obligation  it retains the right to do so 
we have held preliminary discussions with heller to obtain waivers for the events of non compliance  however  no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully obtain the required consents 
we are in default of a million note payable to trinity industries  inc trinity 
we and trinity have entered into litigation regarding the note payable see item legal proceedings 
our liquidity has been constrained by our borrowing base limitations and by our operating losses and  as a result  our financial position and cash flows have been adversely effected 
we have experienced an increase in the level of our accounts payable at december  as compared to prior periods 
we continue to explore various alternative to improve our liquidity  including refinancing our indebtedness with other lenders 
in addition  we have identified and are pursuing the sale of non strategic assets as well as raising additional debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully refinance our indebtedness with other lenders  or successfully sell non strategic assets 
during the third quarter of  we developed and implemented a turnaround plan to streamline our operations and refocus on our core competencies through enhanced revenue growth  elimination of waste and development of employees 
as a part of this turnaround plan  we closed duplicate facilities  reduced personnel  eliminated certain products  wrote off the related inventory  and adopted uniform information systems platforms in the fastener segment 
on a going forward basis  we intend to i consolidate an additional plant into an existing facility  ii sell three parcels of excess real estate  iii convert the distribution operations of our fastener segment to a common erp system  and iv continue the implementation of lean manufacturing 
we will continue to pursue other similar measures when it is our best interest to do so 
the energy segment  excluding our refinery demolition operations  is closely tied to the price of oil and gas 
sales and operating income within the energy group have been adversely effected over the past twelve to fifteen months 
this reduction in sales volume and profitability has been primarily attributable to reductions in the worldwide and gulf coast rig counts  continued caution regarding the long term hydrocarbon price environment  consolidation within the oil and gas industry  and ongoing cost reduction efforts by oil and gas companies 
within the energy segment  we believe that sales reached their lowest levels during the second and third quarters of increasing worldwide demand for oil and gas coupled with declining production in many areas should support a more stable and favorable level of oil and gas prices in the future  resulting in increased exploration and production spending in and an improved demand for oilfield services 
we have experienced such a trend for the first quarter of in our energy group  with increasing backlog and sales in the first quarter of over the fourth quarter of within the fastener segment  the stud bolt and gasket group serves both the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the hydrocarbon processing industry 
the stud bolt and gasket operations have experienced results similar to the energy segment operations 
as a result in  we closed an unprofitable distribution location  eliminated the personnel at that location and wrote off inventory 
our expectation is that with increasing oil and gas prices  sales and profitability within these operations will improve 
we have experienced such a trend for the first quarter of in our stud bolt and gasket operations  with increasing backlog and sales in the first quarter of over the fourth quarter of within the fastener segment  the engineered fasteners group s operating profits have been adversely effected by over capacity and resulting inefficient operations 
as a result  we have closed two manufacturing facilities and have consolidated their operations into the three remaining facilities 
personnel reductions and inventory write offs took place in connection with these facility consolidations 
we expect the full benefit of the various overhead and cost reductions to occur in the heavy fabrication segment s sales and profitability have decreased significantly in the second half of compared to this segment s customers have seen a reduction in their margins because of the volatility of oil feedstock prices during  and have significantly reduced their capital spending 
in addition  it has experienced significant competitive pressures from overseas 
mainly because of these factors  revenues continued to decline in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of however  in response to this revenue decline  we have continued to reduce overhead and make other operational improvements to increase the efficiency of our operations as well as seek new markets for our products 
the composition of our backlog at the end of the first quarter of reflects this approach since a significant portion consists of products for the power generation industry as opposed to our traditional products that serve the hydrocarbon processing industry 
net cash provided by used in operating activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to  which used cash of million and  which provided cash of million 
cash was provided in primarily because although the sum of the net loss added to depreciation and amortization was a negative number  it was more than offset by the positive cash generated by the reduction of accounts receivable and inventory levels during which decreased as sales decreased 
the cash used in was primarily as a result of the acquisition of beaird and the related net increases in receivables  inventory  other assets and accounts payable over those acquired 
beaird s receivables and inventories increased as sales increased for the six months ended december  compared to the six month period ended june   which was prior to the beaird acquisition 
additionally  receivables and payables increased at beaird as million in accounts receivable and all liabilities were distributed to the seller prior to acquisition 
cash was provided in primarily because net income and depreciation and amortization were greater than increases in current assets resulting from increased sales 
net cash used in investing activities 
principal uses of cash are for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
for  and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  the company made investments in unconsolidated affiliates of million  million and million  respectively 
other significant investing activities included acquisitions in and the aggregate cash purchase price for acquisitions was million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities 
sources of cash from financing activities include borrowings under our credit facilities and sales of equity securities 
financing activities provided net cash of million in compared with million in and million in during  we had net borrowings of million under our credit facilities compared to million and million during and  respectively 
during  we had proceeds from issuance of long term obligations of million compared to proceeds of million in and million in during  we made principal payments on long term obligations of million compared to million in and million in during  we issued common stock providing net proceeds of million compared to net proceeds of million in and million in inflation although we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on operating results  our business may be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality we believe that our business is not subject to any significant seasonal factors  and do not anticipate significant seasonality in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb standard no 
this statement extended the effective date of statement no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating what impact adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
year compliance we were faced with the task of assuring that our automated data processing and other microprocessor controlled equipment were capable of distinguishing st century dates 
we believe that our financial and other business applications are year compliant as well as our manufacturing plant control systems and other equipment and devices with embedded microprocessor controls 
during the first part of  only minor year problems have been encountered  which caused virtually no impact to business operations 
however  final resolution of our year compliance cannot be fully evaluated until all possible computer applications and processes have been exercised and year readiness of key third party suppliers  service providers and customers has been completely validated 
costs incurred relating to making the company year compliant  which were not significant  were expensed in the period in which they were incurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rate under our revolving line of credit and certain of our term debt 
as of december   the revolving line of credit had a principal balance of million and an interest rate that floats with prime
