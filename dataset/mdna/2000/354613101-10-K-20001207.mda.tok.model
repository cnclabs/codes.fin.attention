item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
we also make some statements relating to the future which are called forward looking statements 
although we do our best to make clear and accurate forward looking statements  the actual results and outcomes could be significantly different from those that we discuss in this document 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on these forward looking statements 
we encourage you to read the risk factors section below  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income are derived from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional and private accounts  and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public via three main brand names o franklin o templeton o mutual series our sponsored investment products include a broad range of domestic and global international equity  balanced  fixed income  sector and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
in fiscal  we anticipate broadening our product lines with funds currently offered by two companies 
in october  the acquisition of bissett and associates investment management ltd 
bissett  added funds to our canadian product line  primarily in the balanced and growth asset classes 
it also brought a number of institutional and private clients to the group 
in october  we also announced the proposed acquisition of fiduciary trust company international fiduciary  a bank and trust the deposits of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
fiduciary provides investment management services to institutions and private clients  primarily in the growth style 
the acquisition is subject to approval by fiduciary shareholders and various governmental regulatory authorities  and if approved  the acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal the level of our revenues is largely dependent upon the level and relative composition of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues are also dependent on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts between our subsidiary entities and our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business activity and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers consumer lending and selected retail banking services to individuals 
franklin templeton investments operates primarily in the united states  but we also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
the majority of these revenues and associated expenses  however  are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
at september   we employed approximately  people in countries  serving customers on six different continents 
assets under management in billions as of september  vs vs equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid funds fixed income tax free taxable domestic global international total fixed income money funds total simple monthly average for the year investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  are calculated using a daily average assets under management figure 
our assets under management at the end of fiscal were billion  higher than the prior fiscal year end 
the simple monthly average value of these assets during fiscal was billion as compared to billion in fiscal  a increase 
as was evident in fiscal  the change in the simple monthly average assets under management is generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the period end change year over year 
equity assets comprised of our ending assets under management at september   as compared to at the same time last year 
the change in our assets under management was as follows 
assets under management in billions year ended september  vs vs beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions appreciation depreciation ending assets under management during fiscal and fiscal  our sponsored investment products experienced overall net cash outflows in contrast to the net cash inflows experienced in fiscal gross sales increased in fiscal on average across our sponsored investment products  but sales increases were strongest in the equity products  which accounted for of total sales during the fiscal year 
in fiscal and fiscal  net outflows were offset by market appreciation 
in fiscal  market depreciation  principally in the fourth quarter  offset net inflows 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years 
in millions except per share amounts vs vs net income earnings per share basic diluted without restructuring charge operating margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin is earnings before interest  taxes on income  depreciation and the amortization of intangibles divided by total revenues 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal increased by and  respectively  principally as a result of increased investment management fees from increased average assets under management and as a result of a restructuring charge taken in fiscal net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased by  principally as a result of the million pretax restructuring charge in fiscal and decreased investment management fee revenues 
the table below presents the percentage change in each category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal operating revenues as a percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues summary in fiscal  total operating revenues increased due primarily to increased simple monthly average assets under management and shareholder servicing fee increases 
in fiscal  operating revenues fell from fiscal levels as investment management and underwriting and distribution fees declined consistent with decreases in the simple monthly average value of our assets under management and sales volumes 
investment management fees investment management fees  the largest component of our operating revenues  include both investment advisory and business management fees 
these fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
annual rates vary and generally decline as the average net assets of the portfolios exceed certain threshold levels 
in return for these fees  we provide investment advisory  administrative and other management services 
investment management fees increased in fiscal  primarily due to higher simple monthly average assets under management 
our effective investment management fee rate remained relatively constant during the year at  however  future changes in the composition of assets under management could affect our effective investment management fee rate 
in fiscal  investment management fees decreased  primarily due to lower average simple assets under management and a shift in our asset mix towards lower fee fixed income products 
underwriting and distribution fees underwriting commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of mutual funds that have a sales commission paid at the time of purchase 
distribution fees are paid by our sponsored mutual funds in return for sales and marketing efforts on their behalf 
distribution fees include b plan fees that are subject to maximum pay out levels  based upon a percentage of the assets in each fund 
a significant portion of underwriting commissions and distribution fees are paid to the brokers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the investing public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal  despite a increase in product sales 
the decrease resulted from a decline in commissionable sales year over year  which led to a reduction in aggregate sales commission revenues 
sales at reduced or zero commissions are offered on certain classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
thus  as the mix of sales change  so will our commission revenue 
the decline in sales commission revenue was offset by an increase in distribution fees during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increased simple monthly average assets under management 
underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced commission revenues from lower mutual fund sales and distribution fees from the decrease in simple average assets under management 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered  although some funds are charged fees based on the level of assets under management 
fees are received as compensation for providing transfer agency services which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
current agreements with the sponsored investment products provide that closed accounts in a given calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in fiscal  shareholder servicing fees increased over fiscal this was due to increased fees from funds whose servicing fees are based on assets under management and increases in the per account charge  partially offset by a decrease in the average number of billable accounts for the fiscal year 
in fiscal  shareholder servicing fees increased over fiscal as a result of a million increase in average billable shareholder accounts  a substantial portion of which were closed accounts  and an increase in the per account charge 
other  net other  net consists primarily of revenues from our banking finance operating segment o operating revenues  consisting primarily of interest on loans outstanding and servicing income o interest expense o provision for loan losses other  net has remained relatively constant during the three year period 
securitization of a portion of the auto loan portfolio in march resulted in a loss that was offset by revenues from the residual portfolio 
another securitization is planned during fiscal we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance segment of a basis point movement in market interest rates and we do not expect it would have a material impact on our operating revenues or consolidated results of operations 
operating expenses as a percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets other restructuring charges n a n a total operating expenses summary in fiscal  operating expenses decreased primarily due to the restructuring charge of fiscal in fiscal  operating expenses fell principally due to reduced underwriting and distribution expenses offset by the restructuring charge 
underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution includes sales commissions and distribution fees paid to brokers and other third parties for selling  distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
during fiscal  underwriting and distribution expenses remained at levels 
total sales increased in fiscal by  but a significant number of those additional sales were at a low or zero commission rate  resulting in a smaller proportional increase in the commissions paid to intermediaries in fiscal compared to fiscal distribution fees increased consistent with the growth in simple monthly average assets under management which more than offset the reduced commission expense 
during fiscal  underwriting and distribution expenses decreased  consistent with the downward trend in underwriting and distribution revenues 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased in fiscal  primarily due to annual salary increases awarded in october and market adjustments awarded throughout fiscal for certain employees  partially offset by a decrease in the average employee headcount during fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of employees at september  was approximately  as compared to the approximately  at the same time last year 
in order to hire and retain our key employees in the current low unemployment labor market  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly than our revenues 
compensation and benefits decreased in fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in the overall number of employees following the restructuring plan of fiscal and decreased temporary labor costs and employee overtime 
information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase is not indicative of the actual increase in technology expenses  as we have significantly increased our expenditure on technology intiatives in fiscal however  that increase was offset by a decrease in year expenses and increased capitalization of technology costs following the adoption of a new accounting rule 
during the past year  we embarked on a number of significant system upgrades  successfully transitioned to the year  and developed e business strategies to improve our service levels  work environment and productivity 
we expect that such major system undertakings will continue to have an impact on our overall expenditures through fiscal and beyond 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred slightly higher occupancy costs related to our site consolidation efforts  new facilities and the pending relocation to our san mateo worldwide headquarters 
we capitalized information systems and technology costs of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of year planning  remediation and testing expenditures 
advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal we initiated a number of campaigns to increase the visibility of our three major franklin templeton investments brand names franklin  templeton and mutual series 
this increased expenditure was partially offset by cost efficiencies associated with printing and marketing material production expenditures 
in fiscal  we reduced expenditures on media advertising and reduced other promotional activities in line with our general restructuring efforts 
amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal and in fiscal  principally as a result of lower class c sales in the us certain fund classes  namely classes b and c  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  while  at the same time  our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission to selling brokers and other intermediaries 
similarly  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when certain minimum investment criteria are met  yet our us distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
we have arranged to sell certain deferred commission assets dca arising from our us operations to lightning finance company limited  lfl 
dca that remains on our books  principally class a and c shares  is capitalized and amortized 
our canadian and european sponsored investment products have arranged for financing of these sales commissions directly with lfl 
as a result of these arrangements  canadian and european dca are not recorded in our financial statements 
during the fiscal year  we sold or financed sales commissions globally totaling million to lfl  compared to million in fiscal restructuring charge during fiscal  we recognized pretax restructuring charges of million 
these charges were related to a plan announced and initiated by management in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect to incur any incremental charges with respect to this plan 
all of the million total restructuring charge was utilized at september  the anticipated lost revenues associated with products discontinued in connection with such restructuring are not expected to have a material impact on ongoing results of operations 
other income expense investment and other income is comprised primarily of o dividends from investments in our sponsored mutual funds o interest income from investments in bonds and government securities o realized gains and losses on investments o foreign currency exchange gains and losses investment income increased in fiscal  due to higher average available cash balances to invest  higher interest rates  and greater realized gains 
realized gains of million were included in other income related to the million gain on the sale of our headquarters building in san mateo  which is being recognized over the month leaseback period 
in fiscal  higher interest income was offset by lower dividend income and reduced realized gains from the sale of investments 
interest expense decreased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  following a reduction in our average outstanding debt 
taxes on income our effective income tax rate for fiscal declined to on an annual basis compared to in fiscal and fiscal the effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables increased to  million at september  from  million at september  at september   approximately million was available to franklin templeton investments under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs 
revolving credit facilities at september  totaled million  of which million was available under a day facility 
the remaining million facility will expire in may cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due mainly to higher net income resulting from lower operating expenses  increased revenues and a reduced effective tax rate 
in fiscal  we purchased million of investments  net of sales  invested net cash of million in the banking finance segment  and used million to purchase property and equipment  using a total of million in investing activities 
net cash used in financing activities during the year was million  compared to million in we used approximately million in cash to purchase million shares of common stock and paid approximately million in dividends 
outstanding debt declined to million at september   compared to million at september  debt primarily consisted of fixed interest medium term notes and commercial paper that carried interest at variable rates 
as described in note in notes to the financial statements  we participate in the financial derivatives markets solely to manage our exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations on a portion of commercial paper 
our overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and medium term notes was and  at september  and september   respectively 
through our current interest rate swap agreements and medium term note program we have fixed the rates of interest we pay on of our outstanding debt 
interest rate swaps of million matured in october medium term notes of million mature in march other fixed rate debt has various maturity dates through october we have entered into a series of agreements to finance the construction of a new corporate headquarters on a acre site in san mateo  california 
an owner lessor trust has been set up to finance the construction and lease the completed facility 
the construction is substantially on target and we expect to move into our new headquarters in the summer of the lease agreements are not expected to impact our cash flows or financial condition materially during the initial five year lease period 
we have arranged with lfl for non recourse financing of sales commissions related to our class b shares globally 
we are currently negotiating with lfl to purchase the dca related to class c shares in fiscal at september   the cumulative sales commissions advanced by us which we have sold to or financed through lfl approximated million 
we expect that the principal uses of cash will be to increase assets under management through expansion  make strategic acquisitions  fund property and equipment acquisitions  enhance our technology infrastructure  improve our business processes  pay shareholder dividends and repay and service debt 
we expect to finance future increases in investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  or the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  together with the expected continuing cash flow from operations  our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities  our sales commission financing arrangement and our ability to issue stock will be sufficient to meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs 
risk factors forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  words or phrases about the future such as expected to  will continue  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of statements about key employee compensation  financing construction of our new corporate headquarters  financing up front sales commissions paid  the acquisition of fiduciary  our future cash needs and the expected sources of future cash inflows are also forward looking statements 
these types of statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  such as the factors described in the risk factors outlined below 
these risks and uncertainties could cause our current expectations and predictions in the forward looking statements to be wrong 
forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  and you should not rely on them 
rather  you should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk disclosures in this annual report 
if a circumstance occurs that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate  we have no obligation to publicly announce the change in our expectations  or to revise the forward looking statements 
we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with numerous investment management companies  stock brokerage investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  online and internet investment sites  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
these companies also offer financial services and other investment alternatives 
recent consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
in addition  the online services that we may offer may fail to compete effectively with other alternatives available to investors 
to the extent that existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors  our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
competing securities dealers and banks could restrict sales of our funds 
many of the securities dealers on whom we rely to sell and distribute franklin  templeton and mutual series fund shares also have mutual funds under their own names that compete directly with our products 
the banking industry also continues to expand its sponsorship of proprietary funds 
these firms or banks could decide to limit or restrict the sale of our fund shares  which could lower our future sales and cause our revenues to decline 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisors 
increasing competition in these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one of the major financial advisors who distributes our products were to cease operations  even for a few days  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products  which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
new share classes that we have introduced yield lower revenues and have reduced operating margins 
although we receive reduced or no sales charge at the time of initial investments in our class a shares that are related to tax deferred plans and involve sales of more than million  and in our class b shares and c shares  we must nonetheless pay the related dealer commission 
in addition  due to industry competition  the dealer commissions that we pay on these types of shares are now higher than in the past and may increase in the future 
this could have a negative effect on our liquidity and operating margins 
if our asset mix shifts to predominantly fixed income products  our revenues could decline 
we derive higher fee revenues and income from the equity assets that we manage 
changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a decline in our income and revenue 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global equity markets 
as our asset mix has shifted since from predominantly fixed income to a majority of equity assets  we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in global equity markets 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our income and revenue 
the levels of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations 
global economic conditions  interest rates  inflation rates and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values  and levels of our assets under management 
fluctuations in interest rates and in the yield curve affect the value of fixed income assets under management as well as the flow of funds to and from fixed income funds 
in turn  this affects our asset management revenues from those assets 
similarly  changes in the equity marketplace may significantly affect the level of our assets under management 
the factors above often have opposite effects on equity funds and fixed income funds  making it difficult for us to predict the net effect of any particular set of conditions on our business and to devise effective strategies to counteract those conditions 
we face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets  which could force us to revise our business strategy 
general economic and securities markets fluctuations may reduce our sales and market share 
adverse general securities market conditions  increased market volatility  currency fluctuations  governmental regulations and recessionary global economic conditions could reduce our mutual fund share sales and other financial services products sales 
increased and unusual market volatility and high valuations in the technology sector and many new economy stocks could also reduce our mutual fund share sales to the extent that customers decided to shift to predominately fixed income products 
similarly  our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation 
general economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase 
our inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future portfolios of auto loan and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for class b shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable  for any reason  to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan 
we face increased competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
competition to hire these employees has increased  particularly in certain geographic locations where the majority of our workforce is employed 
we may be forced to offer compensation and benefits to these employees at a level that exceeds inflation 
with historically low unemployment in the united states  qualified personnel are now moving between firms and starting their own companies with greater frequency 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified employees  our overall business condition and revenues could suffer 
our emerging market portfolios and related revenues are vulnerable to political and economic risks associated with emerging markets 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  including the finance subsidiaries of large automobile manufacturers 
some of these competitors can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through which we offer consumer loans could harm the growth of our consumer loan business 
risk factors relating to the pooling of interests combination with fiduciary the transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval 
our agreement and plan of share acquisition with fiduciary is subject to the approval of the share exchange by various governmental and regulatory agencies 
the share exchange is also subject to the approval of the shareholders of fiduciary 
there is no assurance that all the necessary approvals will be obtained 
we may be subject to a substantial termination fee if we cancel the transaction 
the agreement and plan of acquisition requires us to pay a termination fee of million if  under certain circumstances  the agreement and plan of acquisition is terminated 
the combined businesses may not be fully or successfully integrated 
the success of the pooling of interests combination of franklin templeton investments and fiduciary depends in large part on the ability of the businesses of each company to be integrated fully and successfully 
the revenue synergies and cost savings from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to achieve than anticipated 
delays and or disruptions arising from and during the integration and transition in connection with the business combination could make it more difficult for us and fiduciary to attract and maintain business relationships with clients  retain employees  expand and compete effectively 
following the transaction  we will be subject to federal reserve board regulation 
we expect to become a bank holding company and financial holding company that will be subject to federal reserve board regulation under the bank holding company act of following the transaction  we and our subsidiaries will be subject to certain banking regulations  including minimum capital requirements 
additionally  prior approval of the federal reserve board may be required in order to effect a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial position of franklin templeton investments is subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
franklin templeton investments is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily in its debt transactions 
through its interest rate swap agreements and its medium term note program franklin templeton investments has effectively fixed the rate of interest it pays on of its debt outstanding at september  as a result  franklin templeton investments does not believe that the effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on franklin templeton investments financial position  results of operations or cash flow would be material 
we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance segment of a basis point movement in market interest rates and we do not expect it would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations
