item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy synthetech s strategy is to emphasize a commitment to its customers from the early phases of drug discovery through clinical development in order to develop larger orders as the drugs receive regulatory approval 
product overview peptide building blocks 
pbbs are amino acids which have been chemically modified through organic chemistry and biocatalysis techniques to enable them to link with other amino acids or chemicals in a particular defined sequence 
these pbbs are pharmaceutical intermediates and are used as starting materials in the manufacture of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs 
the amino acids which are transformed into pbbs may be either natural amino acids that is  amino acids which occur in nature  including their chiral or mirror image form or synthetic amino acids that is  amino acids which have a side chain that does not occur in nature 
synthetech refers to the synthetic amino acids as specialty amino acids 
since  the company has produced a wide range of natural amino acid pbb products 
the company has also developed and manufactures over three dozen specialty amino acids 
the company uses a wide array of raw materials to produce pbbs 
these materials generally are in adequate supply from multiple suppliers 
the company has developed and scaled up process technology to produce this wide range of pbb products in a grams to tons scale 
the company continues to produce most bulk orders on an as ordered basis 
the company also maintains small inventory quantities of many pbbs  permitting immediate deliveries 
at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million  all of which the company expects to ship during fiscal at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million  including million attributable to the final shipments under a discontinued large scale order 
in january  the company entered into supply and technology agreements with biomeasure incorporated  a boston area biotechnology company and a subsidiary of groupe pharmaceutique beaufour ipsen of france with several specialty amino acids under development 
under the supply agreement  the company has agreed to supply all of biomeasure s requirements for a particular specialty amino acid 
this agreement continues from year to year unless terminated in writing by one of the parties 
the company and biomeasure are also parties to a license agreement giving biomeasure the option to receive a license to produce for its own use the specialty amino acids which are the subject of the supply agreement between the parties 
under this license agreement  biomeasure must pay certain royalty amounts based on any amount it produces 
marketing the company markets its products and capabilities through attendance at trade shows  listings in biotechnology and chemical industry directories  advertisements in chemical trade periodicals and an internet presence 
in addition  the company maintains ongoing direct relationships with major pharmaceutical firms  emerging biopharmaceutical firms  contract drug synthesis firms and other firms which it believes might have a need for its products 
the company typically sells its products directly to its customers  although it uses sales representatives for some european sales and has often sold products to japanese customers through chemical trading firms 
customers although the company has several hundred customers in more than countries  the company expects that a few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues each year 
during fiscal  the top customers represented of the company s revenues 
of these twenty customers  were major pharmaceutical companies  were emerging biopharmaceutical companies and were contract drug synthesis companies 
the company had three customers each accounting for over of fiscal revenue f 
hoffman la roche  ltd  ucb bioproducts sa and searle  which individually accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s fiscal revenues 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  sales to international customers were million  million  and million  respectively  accounting for approximately   and  of the company s total revenues 
these sales were principally to europe and mexico for fiscal and to europe for fiscal and see note j to financial statements 
competition because peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs are relatively new  the market in the past for pbbs has been quite small with sales typically in the hundreds of kilos or smaller size 
as a result  the pbb market has not attracted a significant amount of direct competition 
as the market continues to grow with larger order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in multi kilo quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of approximately a dozen domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of specialty amino acids  the company has competition on a selected product basis at the multi kilo scale from approximately half a dozen fine chemical producers in europe  japan and the united states 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
competition also increases for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into approved status as a result of the increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
many of the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them which are significantly greater than those available to the company 
the principal methods of competition in the market for pbbs and other fine chemicals are quality  delivery responsiveness  customer service and price 
the company believes that it competes effectively in each of these areas 
the company also believes that its production of a wide range of products and quantities gives it a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in addition  the company believes that pharmaceutical companies generally view internal production of pbbs as a misallocation of resources and  given a reliable source of a quality product  would rather obtain them from an outside supplier 
research and development the company s research and development group is composed of seven people  of which three have graduate degrees in chemistry 
the company s research and development efforts focus on process development to support the company s pbb product lines 
in addition  the group explores alternative scaleable routes for pbb production  especially for its specialty amino acids 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company s research and development expenses were   and  respectively 
these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
employees as of may   the company employed individuals 
regulatory matters as the company s products are intermediates sold to drug manufacturers  the company has been generally unaffected by fda regulation which is directed at the drug manufacturers 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company expects these programs will often include more extensive documentation 
the company anticipates that the expenses of implementing these programs will increase in the future 
the company s business is also subject to substantial regulation in the areas of safety  environmental control and hazardous waste management 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
as additional and more extensive regulations are being added in these areas at the federal  state and local levels  the compliance costs will inevitably continue to increase 
the operation of fine chemical manufacturing plants entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or an unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
also  the company generates hazardous and other wastes which are disposed of at various off site facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities due to releases of such substances into the environment 
in fiscal  the company undertook capital expenditures aggregating million associated with air quality scrubbers  waste water handling and other environmental control facilities 
the company is currently reviewing additional capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities and has not determined its fiscal budget 
the company maintains property damage insurance  liability insurance  environmental risk insurance  and product liability insurance 
product liability use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
there can be no assurance that claims for product liability will not be asserted against the company or that the company would be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company maintains product liability insurance with a million limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
company background the company was formed in to develop novel chemical process technology by combining classical organic chemistry with enzyme based biocatalysis 
for the first several years  it operated mainly as a research and development group focused on process development of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals 
after its initial public offering in  the company s research efforts were concentrated on the development of a proprietary process for aspartame and l phenylalanine 
although the company has entered into one license for this technology  the company discontinued marketing this technology in and does not expect additional licensing revenue 
throughout its development during the s  the company also offered contract research services 
these research services were typically provided to pharmaceutical clients and generally involved the development of biocatalytic processes that is  chemical processes which are affected by the use of enzymes or micro organisms 
since the end of fiscal  the company has phased out contract research services and does not anticipate receiving any significant revenue from research services in the future 
by the end of the s  the company  building on prior experience  began to focus on the production of pbbs and other fine chemicals for customers 
with the successful completion of two large scale orders  the company has demonstrated its capability as a full cycle grams to tons pbb producer 
factors affecting future results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and may contain the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  will be  will continue  will likely result or words or phrases of similar meanings 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following uncertain market for products  customer concentration  and potential quarterly revenue fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced from time to time substantial period to period revenue fluctuations reflecting the industry environment in which the company has operated 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the food and drug administration fda  and  even if approved  the ultimate potential of such drugs 
recurring sales of pbbs for discovery or clinical trial stage development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from year to year and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales and the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
industry cost factors 
the market for pbbs is dependent on the market for pharmaceutical products 
the levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of prescription pharmaceuticals are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow these drugs to be sold on a profitable basis 
in addition  as cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have tightened  the cancellation rate for drug development programs has increased 
industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes which may not include pbbs 
competition 
in the past  the company has not had a significant amount of direct competition for discovery and clinical trial stage drug development projects 
the company believes that this resulted from peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs  particularly those which utilize synthetic amino acids  being relatively new and the market for pbbs relatively small 
as the market has continued to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in the multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
competition has also increased for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into an approved status as a result of increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
regulatory matters 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require the company to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a chemical manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  the company generates hazardous materials and other wastes which are disposed at various offsite facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
the company has obtained environmental risk insurance 
potential regulation 
the pbbs produced by the company are intermediate ingredients which are then processed by the companies to which they are sold  and are therefore currently not subject to the requirements of the fda 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company believes that these programs will often become more extensive 
accordingly  the company expects its compliance documentation efforts will continue to increase and anticipates that the expenses of implementing such programs will increase in the future 
it is also possible that in the future that the company may not be able to comply with the applicable documentation or such documentation may require substantial incremental expense for additional labor and capital 
product liability 
use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
claims for product liability could be asserted against the company and the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company has purchased product liability insurance with a limit of million 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
risks of technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies 
the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  and technological developments could cause the company s products and technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
manufacturing capacity 
as a manufacturer of pbbs  the company will continually face risks regarding the availability and costs of raw materials and labor  the potential need for additional capital equipment  increased maintenance costs  plant and equipment obsolescence and quality control 
the company has constructed additional manufacturing and related facilities on its site in albany  oregon 
nevertheless  existing facilities may not have sufficient capacity to meet the future demand for the company s products 
a disruption in the company s production or distribution could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
conversely  the company may not have sufficient demand to utilize the additional capacity  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
risks of international business 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended march  the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales 
the company s business is and will be subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign governmental regulation and changes in economic conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
in addition  the company s sale of its products is subject to the risks associated with legislation and regulation relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges  restrictions and retaliatory actions on imports into other countries in which the company s products may be sold 
the company is also subject to similar risks with respect to the importation of raw materials from foreign countries 
item properties synthetech s headquarters and production facility are located in albany  oregon 
the company purchased this albany  oregon property in since then  it has undergone a number of plant and building expansions on site 
at present  the company s facilities  which aggregate  square feet  include production  pilot plant  laboratory  warehouse and office space 
these facilities include a recently constructed separate  square foot production facility with six production bays 
three of these bays have been outfitted with reactor vessels and other equipment and are operational 
a fourth bay is being outfitted with reactor vessels and other equipment and can be completed and put into service as the company needs additional capacity 
the final two bays remain vacant and available for future expansion 
to accomplish the plant expansions  synthetech has contracted with various third party providers 
the company typically has issued purchase orders to such providers with detailed specifications  services to be provided and the prices to be paid 
the company has received either limited or no written warranties by such third party providers and  therefore  may be limited in its ability to pursue remedies in the event that the new building has problems or other defects in the future 
however  the building has been inspected by the city of albany to verify that  as constructed  it meets all applicable building codes  including ada  electrical  seismic  fire and hazardous occupancy 
all specifications were reviewed by an independent third party engineering firm selected by the city of albany prior to approval of various construction permits

combined with the company s already well established production capability at the research and clinical testing stages  the company has demonstrated a full cycle grams to tons production capability 
this full cycle capability reinforces synthetech s long term growth strategy emphasizing a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development and culminating in marketed drugs 
despite the drop in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal  the company remains profitable and in a sound financial condition 
the company s operating cash flow during fiscal and financial reserves enabled it to continue significant investments in facilities and organizational infrastructure 
while the financial results for the first half of fiscal may be similar to the second half of fiscal  synthetech remains well positioned for growth and active as a supplier of peptide building blocks pbbs for several pharmaceutical development projects in clinical trials 
although the progress and timing of these projects remain outside the company s control  there are a number of different combinations with the potential to generate substantial future revenues 
operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by each item included in the statements of income 
percentage of revenues fiscal year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative operating income other income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues synthetech revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflecting the unpredictability and potential for significant revenue fluctuations associated with the industry environment in which the company operates 
revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal synthetech s revenue decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal and revenue increase in fiscal compared to fiscal were largely due to absence or presence of large scale orders 
revenues from large scale orders were million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million large scale order revenue in fiscal was attributable to the completion of a large scale pbb order for a marketed drug initially received in fiscal this order provided million and  of revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
one other large scale order for a marketed drug provided million and million of revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
the company estimates that in fiscal approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company estimates that approximately and  respectively  of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately and  respectively  went into drugs in clinical trials and approximately and  respectively  went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of the company s sales  publicly available information and information to the extent available from customers 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period continues to be unpredictable to a large extent 
although pbb sales associated with marketed drugs are more likely to provide a longer term  ongoing revenue stream than sales associated with drugs at the clinical or discovery stages  continuation of customer demand for pbbs associated with marketed drugs remains subject to various market conditions  including  without limitation  potential use of alternative manufacturing routes and continued market demand for the drug and competition from other suppliers of pbbs 
for example  the customer to whom the company shipped million in fiscal pbb orders adopted an alternative lower cost manufacturing route not using synthetech s pbb and the company does not expect any additional orders for this product from this customer 
accordingly  while large scale orders for marketed drugs can provide significant and predictable revenues for the duration of the orders  there continues to be a significant risk that revenues can fluctuate from period to period 
the company is also not expecting additional orders in the near term from the other customer which placed large scale orders in fiscal and since certain side effects have reduced the demand for the drug and  therefore  the demand for the company s pbbs 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period at the clinical and discovery stages remains unpredictable as well 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal the company received a million order for use in a drug in clinical trials 
the customer s inability to timely source raw materials for the order and a subsequent curtailed and revised scope of this project resulted in only  of product being shipped during fiscal and the payment to the company of a  idle equipment reservation charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal under the revised scope of this project  synthetech expects to ship an additional million for this project to the customer in fiscal with this industry environment  it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future business 
the company s backlog of pbb orders at march  was million of which million represents shipments under the project discussed above compared to a backlog at march  of million 
while the company believes that the financial results for the first half of fiscal may be similar to the second half of fiscal  it remains active as a supplier of peptide building blocks pbbs for several pharmaceutical development projects in clinical trials 
these projects could have substantial future business potential 
there are  however  many factors affecting the success of these drug candidates and synthetech s involvement 
see industry factors below 
gross profit gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this reflects a decrease in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal  and a increase in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profit margins were  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the gross profit margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected a combination of factors the downward pressure caused by a lower level of revenues in fiscal and the increased manufacturing overhead costs associated with the second phase expansion of the new plant in fiscal being somewhat offset by the positive impact of the idle equipment reservation fee 
the increase in the gross profit margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from the mix of products ie  type and volume of products sold as individual orders and the fiscal s closely associated high revenue levels 
the company expects revenues and product mix to continue to fluctuate from period to period and cause variation in gross profit margins 
operating expenses research and development r d expense increased to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal r d expense was  or  in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in personnel 
these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in sg a in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflected a reduced bonus pool  reduced compensation expenses related to the granting of a non qualified stock option  and payments made pursuant to a termination of employment in fiscal the increase in sg a in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflected the increased labor costs described below and payments made pursuant to a termination of employment 
sg a as a percentage of sales was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating income operating income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  company wide labor costs including the employee bonus pool labor costs decreased to million from million in fiscal while the salary component of labor costs in fiscal increased  it was more than offset by the significant reduction of the bonus pool for fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company s labor costs increased to million from million in fiscal commencing in the second half of fiscal and continuing in fiscal  the company hired additional employees in connection with its plant expansion and overall company growth 
the increase in labor costs in fiscal reflected this hiring program 
in addition  the company s fiscal employee bonus pool was significantly higher than the fiscal year pool  reflecting fiscal s record results 
as a percentage of revenues  operating income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal other income the  net other income in fiscal resulted primarily from  of interest earnings less miscellaneous expenses of  the  net other income in fiscal resulted primarily from  of interest earnings less miscellaneous expenses of  the  net other income in fiscal primarily resulted from  of interest earnings and a  recognized gain from the sale of securities available for sale

industry factors the market for pbbs is driven by the market for synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs in which they are incorporated 
the drug development process for these drugs is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of these drug development efforts  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda and  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of such drugs 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  taking only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of the activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of research and development and clinical trials 
the market for peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs is still very early in development 
recurring sales of pbbs for development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from quarter to quarter and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs can also provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs  however  remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
also  industry cost pressures can cause pharmaceutical companies to explore and  as was the case with one of the large scale orders  ultimately adopt alternative manufacturing processes which do not include the company s pbbs as an intermediate 
finally  with the longer term  larger scale orders  the company expects increased competition to supply these pbbs 
accordingly  these industry factors create an inability for the company to predict future demand beyond its current order base 
until the company develops a stable baseload of demand  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of million compared to million at march  the company does not invest in derivative securities 
the company s cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled million  a million decrease from the march  level 
this net decrease reflected a number of factors including decreased accounts receivable  increased inventory  decreased accounts payable and increased deferred revenue together with substantial capital expenditures involving the phase two of the plant expansion and upgrades to the existing plant 
all of the company s million capital expenditures in fiscal were internally funded 
in addition  the company has a  unsecured bank line of credit 
as of march  there was no amount outstanding under the bank line 
the decrease in accounts receivable to million at march   from million at march   reflected the lower level of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year 
the increase of income tax receivable to  at march  from at march  and the reduction of accrued income taxes to at march  from  at march  reflected overpayments of estimated taxes 
the increase in inventories to million at march  from million at march  principally reflected the manufacturing and stocking of certain products for future sale and  to a lesser extent  the provisioning of raw materials for specific projects 
the decrease in accounts payable to  at march  from million at march  primarily reflected the timing of expenditure commitments related to the second phase of the plant expansion and timing of raw material purchases 
the decrease in accrued compensation to  at march  from  at march  primarily reflected accrued bonus and related compensation paid during the first quarter 
the increase in deferred revenue to  at march  from  at march  resulted from customer advance payments 
in fiscal  the company completed the  square foot  two story new building plant expansion project 
in this initial phase  the company completed the building structure and built out two of the six production bays 
the overall engineering  construction and equipment costs for this project spanning one and one half years were approximately million 
the company has undertaken an approximately million second phase expansion outfitting additional bays of the new plant with four additional multipurpose reactor systems and constructing additional warehouse  bulk storage and related facilities 
most of the second phase expansion has been completed and is operational 
during fiscal  the company s capital expenditures were million  million of which were for the second phase plant expansion and  for the existing plant and equipment upgrades 
during fiscal  the company estimates that roughly million will be used substantially for existing plant and equipment upgrades and a small amount to finish the second phase plant expansion 
the company  however  has not finalized its capital expenditure budget for fiscal and will be also reviewing other possible projects 
the company expects to finance these capital expenditures internally and does not anticipate a need for any new debt or equity financing
