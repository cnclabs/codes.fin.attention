from its position as the market leader in organic fluid milk sales  horizon organic has leveraged its brand to create a full line of refrigerated organic dairy products 
formation and structure of the company 
horizon organic was founded in boulder  colorado  in and introduced its first products  organic fat free yogurts  in the company introduced organic fluid milk in  and since that time  it has developed and introduced a number of new organic dairy products  including cottage cheese  hard cheese  butter and sour cream 
in  the company successfully launched its line of orange and grapefruit juices under the horizon organic brand 
since  the company has focused its efforts on expanding and integrating a nationwide production  processing and distribution system 
from to  the company contracted for the supply of organic fluid milk with an organic dairy cooperative which  during that period  was located only in wisconsin 
in  the company made a strategic decision to begin developing its own organic milk supply 
accordingly  the company began building a herd of organic cows and developing its own source of organic feed  and entered into a lease and management agreement with sunrise organic farms  inc sunrise a subsidiary of aurora dairy corporation aurora for a dairy farm in idaho 
these facilities became the company s idaho dairy in fiscal aurora is controlled by marc peperzak  vice chairman of the company s board of directors

historically  the company has experienced a return rate of approximately of sales under this guarantee 
sales under this provision are not significant 
horizon organic engages in a range of consumer and trade marketing activities and in the future plans to increase its marketing spending as a percentage of sales 
internal production of milk 
in establishing the idaho dairy and the maryland dairy  the company made a substantial investment in organic dairy herds and in converting the farmland to provide a source of organic feed 
horizon organic s animal care and facility maintenance costs are significantly higher than conventional dairies 
the company began converting the idaho dairy farm land to organic status in  but due to the three year growing requirement to be certified organic  the feed grown on the farmland was not certified as organic until the company began converting the maryland dairy to organic in and expects that it will be certified organic beginning in from through  the company purchased all of its organic feed from third party suppliers  and the company continues to purchase a majority of organic feed on the open market 
the company sells the feed it grows  which it cannot certify as organic  as conventional feed at conventional prices 
since the prices of conventional farm milk and feed historically have been significantly lower than organic  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  lower gross profit during periods when its company owned dairy farms are being converted to organic 
the cost of farm milk from the idaho dairy and the maryland dairy is significantly influenced by the company s ability to operate these dairy farms at capacity 
the idaho dairy achieved milking capacity in december during  the company s maryland dairy achieved permitted milking capacity for head 
however  the company s ability to operate the maryland dairy at maximum capacity  head will depend  in part  on its ability to secure operating permits for additional cows 
in maryland  the company must obtain a waste water discharge permit from the maryland department of environment 
the permitting process will require that the company makes additional capital expenditures at the maryland dairy to accommodate the addition of such cows 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the requisite permits to increase the number of cows at the maryland dairy 
during march  the company entered into a dairy herd management and supply agreement with aurora 
the agreement allows for the company to provide and maintain an organic dairy herd of approximately  milking head at aurora s colorado facilities 
horizon organic is to provide the feed for the animals while also paying for approximately  in equipment and leasehold improvements 
aurora will be responsible for managing the herd and paying for all operating expenses outside the feed  breeding  cattle costs and related leasehold company purchased equipment depreciation 
the company follows generally accepted accounting principles for farm accounting 
cows are depreciated using the straight line method over five years commencing with their first milking 
the capitalized cost of each cow is based on the purchase price plus preproduction costs 
the idaho dairy and the maryland dairy sell organic farm milk to horizon organic at an intercompany transfer price which the company believes approximates fair value 
all intercompany sales have been eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
purchase of organic milk from third party producers 
to augment its internal supply of organic farm milk  the company contracts with various organic farmers and cooperatives throughout the united states 
except for one contract that extends through december  these contracts are generally for to months and are renewable upon agreement by the company and the producer 
all production contracts require that the company purchase minimum quantities of organic farm milk 
if the company cannot use the minimum amount as organic fluid milk or other organic products  the company sells the organic milk as conventional milk and records the difference between the company s purchase price and the conventional price in cost of sales 
processing 
as of december   horizon organic has processing agreements with a national network of dairy processors that process the company s organic farm milk into refrigerated organic fluid milk and other organic dairy products 
in addition  it has four processors that produce organic citrus juice and has two licensing agreements with egg processors 
the company also uses three refrigerated warehouses where it inventories organic dairy products 
the costs associated with processing arrangements are included in the cost of sales 
these costs include the cost of processing as well as payments that horizon organic makes to processors which are then paid into the federal milk market order system 
the company s product sales mix affects its overall gross margin since processing costs vary by product 
although the company has a long term processing agreements with worcester creameries corp 
worcester and one of its affiliates and processing and distribution agreements with certain suiza foods corporation suiza subsidiaries  it does not have written agreements with its other processors

the remainder of the company s total net sales includes sales of its cheeses  cottage cheese  cream cheese  sour cream and sales of non dairy products such as organic eggs and organic citrus juices  as well as royalty and consulting income 
although the company anticipates that its product mix will change over time as it introduces other organic dairy products in accordance with its business strategy  the company does not believe that the product mix will change significantly in the near term 
government regulation of milk pricing 
the federal milk market order system was developed to ensure the availability of farm milk for certain products  such as fluid milk  and to provide minimum prices for farm milk regardless of how the farm milk is actually used ie  whether it is used for a high value product like fluid milk or a lower value product like non fat dry milk powder 
the processor is responsible for paying fees to the federal milk market order system 
dairy processors pass through these pooling charges to dairies  like the company  through their prices for processing farm milk 
these payments are determined by the federal milk market order system administrators on a monthly basis  are billed to the company in the month after they are determined  are generally related to conventional farm milk prices and can vary materially from period to period 
in addition  states in new england have established  and certain other states are in the process of attempting to form  regional milk price compacts designed to provide farmers within the compact states with a minimum price that will result in higher milk prices than the federally mandated minimum prices 
for example  the northeast interstate dairy compact has resulted in farm milk prices higher than federal order minimum prices 
these charges are assessed as compact over order charges 
as with the federal milk market orders  these charges are not known or predictable in advance and may increase the company s costs 
for fiscal and  the company paid more than  and  respectively  for pooling  compact and administrative assessment charges
