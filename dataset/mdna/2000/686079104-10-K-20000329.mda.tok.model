the company s long range strategic plan emphasizes the commitment to become the primary low cost producer of specialty plate products  while diversifying its other core businesses to minimize the impact of individual product cycles on the company s financial performance 
in pursuing these goals  the company has sought alternatives to its reliance on the domestic market for large diameter pipe  the demand for which is particularly volatile  and the market for commodity plate  which is dictated to a large degree by price considerations only 
in an effort to decrease the company s reliance on the domestic large diameter pipe market and provide additional end use for its steel plate  the company acquired a percent interest in the camrose pipe mill in june from stelco  a large canadian steel producer  which owns the remaining interest in the camrose pipe mill 
in  and  camrose shipped   and  tons  respectively  of steel pipe and generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
during those years stelco was a major supplier of steel plate and coil for the camrose pipe mill 
to expand the company s steel product lines and enter new geographic areas  cf i purchased the pueblo mill and related assets in march in  and  the pueblo mill shipped   and  tons  respectively  and generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
in august  new cf i sold a percent equity interest in new cf i to a subsidiary of nippon 
in connection with that sale  nippon agreed to license to the company its proprietary technology for producing dhh rail under a separate equipment supply agreement 
in november the company sold a percent equity interest in new cf i to two companies of nissho iwai  a large japanese trading company 
the labor contract at the rmsm division expired on september  after a brief contract extension intended to help facilitate a possible contract  on october  the union initiated a strike at the rmsm division 
see part i business labor dispute 
by the end of  the rmsm division had ramped its operating back to pre strike levels with management and replacement workers 
ship ment levels and cost of operations were negatively impacted by reduced production effort and costs specifically related to the strike 
rmsm shipments for the fourth quarter  the period directly affected by the strike  were  tons compared to shipments of  tons in the fourth quarter of company sales in the fourth quarter of of million increased percent from sales of million in the fourth quarter of company shipments increased percent to  tons in the fourth quarter of from  tons in the fourth quarter of the company s average selling price in the fourth quarter of was per ton versus per ton in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales and shipments for the fourth quarter of was primarily due to an increase in plate and welded pipe sales for the oregon steel division 
the lower average selling price in the fourth quarter of is primarily due to lower average selling prices for rod  commodity plate  and canadian welded pipe products  reduced shipments of rail and seamless pipe  and a shift in product mix to a greater percentage of lower priced rod products 
the oregon steel division shipped  tons with an average selling price of per ton during the fourth quarter of  compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of during the fourth quarter of increased fourth quarter shipment levels are the result of increased welded pipe shipped compared to the fourth quarter of the reduced average selling price is primarily due to substantially lower market prices for steel plate and a higher percentage of commodity plate to total plate shipped during the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period 
during the fourth quarter of  the rmsm division shipped  tons with an average selling price of per ton compared to  tons with an average selling price of per ton during the fourth quarter of decreased fourth quarter shipment levels are the result of decreased rail shipments partially offset by increased rod and bar shipments compared to the fourth quarter of rail  and rod and bar shipments were  tons and  tons  respectively  in the fourth quarter of compared to  tons of rail and  tons of rod and bar products in the fourth quarter of the reduced average selling price compared to is the result of the shift in product mix as rod and bar have a significantly lower selling price than that of rail 
rod and bar shipments represented percent of total fourth quarter shipments for the division as compared to percent for the corresponding period in gross profits as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter of were percent compared to percent for the fourth quarter of gross profit for the fourth quarter of was impacted by improvement in the operating performance of the camrose mills  partially offset by a decline in profitability for rmsm for the quarter ended december  although both canadian pipe mills ran more profitably for the quarter than for the corresponding period in  camrose s large diameter pipe mill was significantly more profitable because of a decrease in unit conversion and finishing costs as compared to the fourth quarter of the company expects to ship approximately million tons of product during the oregon steel division anticipates that it will ship  tons of welded pipe shipments and over  tons of plate and coil products during the rmsm division anticipates that it will ship more than  tons of rail  and more than  tons of rod  bar  and semifinished products 
if these levels are realized  welded pipe shipments will have decreased  tons from the  tons shipped in due to the completion in of a major sales contract for the company and weaker market conditions for large diameter welded pipe 
as a consequence  in order for the company to continue to operate its combination mill at capacity  the company will seek to sell more plate and coil products to outside customers than it has historically done 
in the current plate and coil pricing environment  the margins on plate and coil are  on average  lower and in some cases significantly lower  than the margins realized on large diameter welded pipe products 
although the average selling prices on plate is expected to increase during  it is expected to still be below pre price levels 
as a result of reduced pipe shipments  the higher shipments of commodity plate and rod products and continued depressed pricing in plate and rod products  the company anticipates that the net income for will be substantially below the net income realized in these results are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially 
comparison of to sales 
sales in of million decreased percent from sales of million in shipments were up slightly in at  tons as compared to  tons in the average selling price in was per ton versus per ton in the decrease in consolidated average selling price was a result of reduced average selling prices for plate  coil  rod and rail  and decreased shipments of rail and seamless pipe as a percentage of total shipments 
the oregon steel division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products at an average selling price per ton of compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of in the increased shipments were the result of a percent increase in plate and coil shipments and a percent increase in pipe shipments 
the decline in average selling price of percent results primarily from the decline in prices for plate products  the decrease in the percentage of higher priced welded pipe products and a decrease in the canadian welded pipe products average selling price 
the average selling price for plate declined percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the high levels of imported steel plate 
see part i business competition and other market factors 
the division s plate mill produced  tons of plate and coil products during compared to  in the rmsm division shipped  tons at an average selling price per ton of compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of the percent decline in total shipments in is the result of reduced rail  seamless pipe and semi finished product shipments partially offset by increased rod and bar shipments 
in may of  the division suspended its seamless pipe operations due to poor market conditions 
see part i business products 
lower rail shipments in were the result of reduced domestic demand for rail products 
gross profits 
gross profit for was percent compared to percent for gross profit was favorably affected by higher shipments of welded pipe and lower manufacturing costs for plate and welded pipe products  due in part to improved production from the combination mill 
the favorable costs for plate and welded pipe were partially offset by the lower average selling prices noted previously  by losses in the seamless pipe business in  and by the subsequent shutdown and severance costs incurred in the temporary closure of the seamless pipe mill 
settlement of litigation 
the company recorded a million gain for from litigation settlements with various graphite electrode suppliers 
a settlement of similar claims totaled million in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administative sg a expenses at million for remained essentially unchanged from million for  but increased as a percentage of sales to percent in from percent in the percentage increase was primarily due to the decrease in sales revenue exceeding the corresponding declines in volume of product shipped 
profit participation 
profit participation plan expense was million in compared to million in the increase in reflects the increased operating profitability of the oregon steel division in interest expense 
total interest cost for was million compared to million in the lower interest cost is primarily the result of a net reduction in debt principal 
capitalized interest was million in compared to million in income tax expense 
the company s effective income tax rate for state and federal taxes was percent for compared to percent for comparison of to sales 
sales in of million increased percent from sales of million in shipments increased percent to million tons in from million tons in the average selling price in was per ton versus per ton in of the million sales increase  million was the result of volume increases and million resulted from higher average selling prices offset by million of insurance proceeds 
the increase in sales and shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of plate  coil and welded pipe products by the oregon steel division and increased shipments of rail products by the rmsm division  offset in part by decreased shipments of seamless pipe and rod and bar products by the rmsm division 
the increased shipments include a percent increase in welded pipe shipments   in compared to  tons in and increased plate and coil shipments due to increased production from the combination mill 
the increased average selling price for was due to increased shipments of welded pipe products as a percent of total products shipped  partially offset by reduced pricing for seamless pipe  rod and commodity plate products 
the markets for the company s plate products were negatively affected by high levels of imports 
the company s commodity plate pricing declined approximately a ton since the beginning of as a result of import activity 
reduced seamless pipe prices were due to the low level of oil prices which reached a year low and reduced us rig counts which fell to near all time lows 
rod product is being severely impacted by the high level of imported rod shipments entering the united states 
average rod pricing has declined over a ton since the beginning of gross profits 
gross profits as a percentage of sales for were percent compared to percent for gross profit margins were positively impacted by increased margins on shipments of welded pipe and rail  offset by lower margins on rod and seamless pipe resulting from the adverse market conditions described above 
also  production costs and gross margins were negatively impacted by the startup of the combination mill and by the labor dispute at the rmsm division as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses for increased million or percent compared to and decreased as a percent of revenues from percent in to percent in the dollar amount increase was primarily due to increased shipping costs due to increased tons shipped in compared to and costs specifically related to the labor dispute with the union at rmsm 
contribution to esop and profit participation 
there was a million contribution to the esop in compared to no contribution in profit participation plan expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in profit participation reflects the decreased profitability in the first three quarters of compared to those quarters of interest expense 
total interest cost for was million  an increase of million compared to the higher interest cost is primarily the result of higher average debt during versus of the million of interest cost in  million was capitalized as part of construction in progress versus million capitalized in income tax expense 
the company s effective income tax rate for state and federal taxes was percent for compared to percent for the effective income tax rate for varied from the combined state and federal statutory rate due to the expiration of certain state tax credits and an establishment of a million valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations was million compared to million in the major items affecting the million increase were increased net income million  and a decrease in inventories in versus an increase in million 
the increase in cash provided by these changes was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in versus a decrease in million  a smaller decrease in accounts receivable in compared to million and a realization of income tax deposits in that exceeded the amount realized in million 
net working capital at december  increased million compared to december  reflecting a million decrease in current liabilities offset by an million decrease in current assets 
the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to the refinancing of the company s operating credit facility which resulted in the amounts outstanding under the facility being classified as long term debt  and a decreased accounts payable balance related to decreased inventory levels 
the decrease in current assets was primarily due to decreased accounts receivable and inventories related to the lower sales and improved production efficiency in versus the company has outstanding million principal amount of first mortgage notes notes due new cf i and cf i guarantors guarantee the notes 
the notes and the guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all the property  plant and equipment and certain other assets of the company exclusive of camrose and the guarantors 
the collateral for the notes and the guarantees does not include  among other things  inventory and accounts receivable 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains potential restrictions on new indebtedness and various types of disbursements  including dividends  based on the company s net income in relation to its fixed charges  as defined 
the company maintains a million revolving bank credit facility credit agreement  which expires june   and may be drawn upon based on the company s accounts receivable and inventory balances  except those of camrose

the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the company s consolidated domestic inventory and accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants including a minimum tangible net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio  and a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio 
cf i incurred million in term debt in as part of the purchase price of the pueblo mill 
this debt is without stated collateral and is payable over ten years with interest at percent 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the debt was million  of which million was classified as long term 
camrose maintains a cdn million revolving credit facility with a canadian bank  the proceeds of which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of camrose and borrowings under this facility are limited to an amount equal to specified percentages of camrose s eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories 
the facility is comprised of two credit lines  a cdn million line that expires september  and a cdn million line that expires september  at the company s election  interest is payable based on either the bank s canadian dollar prime rate  the bank s us dollar prime rate  or libor 
annual commitment fees are 
and 
percent of the unused portion of the cdn million and cdn million credit lines  respectively 
as of december   camrose had  outstanding under the facility 
the company is able to draw up to million of the borrowings available under the credit agreement to support issuance of letters of credit and similar agreements 
the company also maintains a uncollateralized and uncommitted line of credit with another bank to support letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts and interest rate hedges 
at december   million was restricted under outstanding letters of credit 
during the company expended approximately million exclusive of capitalized interest on the capital projects at the rmsm division  and million exclusive of capitalized interest on capital projects at the oregon steel division 
for  the rmsm division and the oregon steel division have budgeted exclusive of capitalized interest approximately million and million  respectively  for capital projects at the manufacturing facilities 
the company believes that its anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through will be met from funds generated by operations and borrowings pursuant to the company s credit agreement 
there is no assurance  however  that the amounts from these sources will be sufficient for such purposes 
in that event  or for other reasons  the company may be required to seek additional financing  which may include additional bank financing 
there is no assurance that such source of funding will be available if required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company s level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that the company and its subsidiaries may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on their indebtedness when due 
the company is currently in compliance with the restrictive debt covenants applicable to its loan agreements  however  the company anticipates that the net income for will be substantially below the net income realized in  increasing the likelihood that the company may not be in compliance with one or more of its covenants during the company is currently in discussions with its lenders to amend the credit agreement to provide additional operating and finan cial flexibility 
management expects to conclude modification of the current credit agreement by the end of the first quarter of year issues 
in response to year compliance issues  the company developed and executed a systematic approach to identifying and assessing potential year issues 
the approach consisted of modifying or replacing equipment and software and performing testing to ensure that all information technology it systems and process logic controller plc components of manufacturing equipment were year compliant as modified  or that any failure to be year compliant would not have a material adverse impact on the company 
these procedures were completed in with the passage of most critical dates  including the commencement of the company s fiscal year  and january   the company has not experienced a significant disruption due to a failure of any it or plc system 
the company has not experienced a significant service interruption as a result of one of the company s major suppliers or customers experiencing a serious disruption due to the year issue 
based on this experience  the company does not expect a significant disruption in the future as a result of the year issue or the fact that is a leap year 
accordingly  the year issue has not had  nor is currently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial conditions  consolidated earnings or consolidated cash flows 
while management believes that the risk is low  it is early in the year and there is a possibility that a year compliance failure related to the company s hardware or software systems may occur 
the company will continue to monitor its systems for such an occurrence 
the company incurred approximately million associated with the year effort 
the cost of the year effort has been funded through normal operating cash flows 
impact of inflation 
inflation can be expected to have an effect on many of the company s operating costs and expenses 
due to worldwide competition in the steel industry  the company may not be able to pass through such increased costs to its customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term debt and long term debt 
the following discussion of market risks necessarily makes forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values will not differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to greater than percent changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in the use of debt instruments or the cash flows associated with them  or changes in commodity market conditions affecting availability of materials in ways not predicted by the company 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company s financial instruments  including debt and cash equivalents 
the company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair values from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to those market sensitive instruments 
the discount rates used for such present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at december   plus or minus percent 
a percent decrease in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a increase in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by million 
a percent increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by million 
there would not be a material effect on consolidated earnings or consolidated cash flows from those changes alone 
foreign currency risk in general  the company uses a single functional currency for all receipts  payments and other settlements at its facilities 
occasionally  transactions will be denominated in another currency and a foreign currency forward exchange contract used to hedge currency gains and losses  however  at december   the company did not have any open forward contracts
