item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
basis of financial statement presentation we are primarily engaged in the discovery and development of human antibody based therapeutics to fight cancer and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
we have developed a broad platform of patented technologies for antibody discovery and development  including our technology for the creation of high affinity fully human antibodies 
through our acquisition of genpharm international  inc  and our recent letter of intent for our collaboration with kirin  we expanded our business to include both our humab mouse and kirin s tc mouse technologies 
these technologies allow us to rapidly create fully human antibodies in about two to four months 
not only can we create new proprietary products  but these technologies provide us with the opportunity to expand our corporate collaborations with both existing and new partners 
we entered into six new corporate partnerships relating to the humab mouse technology during and an additional six new corporate partnerships in to date  we have received upfront payments and we anticipate that we will receive license fees  milestone payments and royalties from such partnerships 
we believe that our acquisition of genpharm  our collaboration with kirin and our expansion into the human antibody business will provide us with significant additional sources of revenue in the foreseeable future 
revenue our revenue is principally derived through licensing our human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and through government grants 
the terms of these collaborations typically include potential license fees and a series of milestone payments commencing upon initiation of clinical trials through commercialization which may total million to million per product if the antibody receives approval from the fda and equivalent foreign agencies 
we are also entitled to royalties on product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  facilities and supply expense relating to antibody product development and to the breeding  caring for and continued development of our humab mice  as well as to the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facility  travel and other expenses relating to our general management  financial  administrative and business development activities 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for   and were principally derived from contract and licensing activities 
total revenues in of  included  of contract revenue received from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
of osaka  japan  or santen   from aventis behring   from eisai co  ltd 
of tokyo  japan  or eisai  and  from small business innovation research grants 
total revenues in of  increased over the increase relates to  received from the sale of mdx  one of our monoclonal antibody products  to merck kgaa  our corporate partner for mdx  and increases in contract and license revenues with merck kgaa  eisai  schering ag  centocor  aventis behring  fibrogen  inc  novartis and medac gmbh 
revenue for increased by  a increase from the increase relates principally to a  milestone payment from centocor  inc centocor holds exclusive commercial licenses to develop humab mouse antibodies to license four targets 
in addition  the increase in reflects payments pursuant to license agreements with merck kgaa 
our cost of sales increased by  in  a increase over in  the increase was principally due to manufacturing expenses incurred in producing mdx for proposed new human clinical trials to be conducted in conjunction with merck kgaa 
our cost of sales decreased by  during  a decrease as compared to the decrease is due to lower production of mdx for merck kgaa 
research and development expense increased  in  a increase from the increase was primarily attributable to a high level of human clinical trials  license fees related to the targeting component used in mdx and mdx  personnel costs and supply expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  during  a decrease from the decrease was principally due to decreased clinical trial activity partially as the result of the suspension of patient enrollment in the phase iii clinical trial of mdx ra 
the research and development expense reduction was partially offset by higher personnel costs 
research and development costs are expected to increase at an accelerated rate as our products progress through the regulatory approval process 
general and administrative expenses increased  in  a increase over the increase was primarily attributable to higher legal fees incurred in connection with a  milestone payment from xenotech  lp relating to the issuance of a lp patent  personnel costs  consulting and shareholder relation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  for  a increase from the increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and heightened business development activities 
these expenses are expected to increase as our products are developed and we expand our humab mouse licensing activities 
acquisition of in process technology charges of  in related to the february  acquisition of houston biotechnology  and the october  acquisition of genpharm 
interest and dividend income increased by  in  a increase over these increases reflected higher average cash balances 
interest and dividend income decreased by  for  a decrease as compared to this decrease was the result of both a lower average cash balance and a lower return on investments 
in  interest expense increased by  the increase is attributable to the amortization of a discount of the liability due to genpharm shareholders pursuant to the acquisition of genpharm in october this liability was satisfied on various dates through september  and as a result  interest expense decreased by  for  a decrease as compared to our income tax provision of  for the year ended december  represented taxes paid related to the genpharm acquisition  which were in excess of the amount of the liability provided for on the date of the acquisition 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  consisted of  received from the sale of a portion of our new jersey state nols and research and development tax credits offset  in part  by a provision for state taxes 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public sales of our securities  contract and license revenues and research product sales 
through december   we had raised  from sales of securities 
we had  and  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and  respectively 
operating activities consumed   and  of cash for the years ended december   and  respectively 
through december  and december   we had invested  and  respectively  in property and equipment 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our products develop 
administrative costs are also expected to increase with the expansion of administrative activities and the creation of an internal sales force 
in connection with our merger with essex medical products  we issued promissory notes to essex chemical corporation in the principal amount of  and committed to pay of our net after tax income until a total of  has been paid  contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
at our option  this contingent obligation may be satisfied by the payment of shares of our common stock having a fair market value equal to the amount owed  provided such shares are registered for sale with the sec 
on june   we repaid the  of notes  plus accrued interest to essex 
at december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  the nol carryforwards expire in   and 
we have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurred  but believe that it is very likely that such a change occurred during  or the effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of nol carryforwards attributable to periods before change 
the amount of the annual limitation depends upon our value immediately before the change  changes to our capital during a specified period prior to the change  and an interest rate which is published monthly 
due to uncertainty as to the date of an ownership change during  or we have not determined the amount of the potential limitation 
any such material limitation could have a significant impact on our ability to use our nol carryforwards 
the new jersey division of taxation has developed a program that allows new or expanding technology and biotechnology businesses to sell their unused nol carryover and unused research and development tax credits to corporate taxpayers in the state for at least of the value of the benefits 
the effective date of this program was january  in  we received  for the sale of a portion of our nols and research and development tax credits 
during we intend to sell additional new jersey nols 
in  or  of our revenue was derived from santen for research funding  or  was from aventis behring for research funding and milestone payments and or  was from eisai for research funding 
in  or  of our total revenue was derived from aventis behring for research funding  or  was from santen for research funding  or  from eisai for a milestone payment and from merck kgaa  including  for producing mdx for proposed new human clinical trials   for research funding and  premium paid for our common stock over the fair market value 
in  or  of our total revenue was derived from a milestone payment made by centocor 
in addition  or  of our total revenue was derived from merck kgaa  consisting of  for producing mdx for proposed new human clinical trials   for research funding and a  technology option fee 
no other single source accounted for more than of our total revenues for  and we have recently entered into a binding letter of intent with eos biotechnology to develop and commercialize genomics derived antibody based therapeutic products 
pursuant to the letter of intent  on or before may  we are required to pay  to eos biotechnology and to deposit an additional  in a third party escrow account to be released over time to eos biotechnology upon the achievement of certain milestones 
we have entered into a non binding letter of intent with idm relating to the development of certain of our non humab mouse antibody based products 
under the terms of the letter of intent  we are required to pay idm  upon the execution of a definitive agreement which we anticipate will occur during the first quarter of in addition  we are required to purchase additional equity in idm  or a comparable interest in a new jointly owned entity to fund up to an additional  in the event idm does not complete a public or private financing of at least  on or before december  such an event could cause us to incur losses to the extent of our investment in idm 
although we believe that the proceeds from the offering  if completed  together with our current cash balances  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and cash generated from contract and licensing activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months  we may require additional financing within this time frame 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements

update on year computer issues we did not experience any computer or systems problems relating to the year upon review of our internal and external systems during  we determined that we did not have any material exposure to such computer problems and that the software and systems required to operate our business and provide our services were year compliant 
as a result  we did not incur  and do not expect to incur  any material expenditures relating to year systems remediation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
however  we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us stock funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates
