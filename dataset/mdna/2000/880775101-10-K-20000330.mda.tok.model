item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our line of business is to develop  market and sell broadband access systems 
our objective is to be the leading provider of broadband access systems to providers of services to residential and commercial end users 
since our inception in january  we have focused on the development of our patented s cdma technology  as well as certain other core technologies  to enable broadband transmission of data over cable networks 
we began the specification and design of our first asic in october and produced the first version of this asic in september at the same time  we developed an end to end broadband access system  the teracomm system  around the asic 
we commenced volume shipments of our teracomm system in the first quarter of however  with some recent acquisitions of complimentary technology and businesses  we have also turned our attention to providers of broadband services using existing telephone  copper wire infrastructures and wireless systems 
we sell our products both in north america and internationally  and we market our products primarily to cable operators and distributors 
our strategy is to supply leading providers of broadband access services worldwide 
consistent with this strategy  our initial target market consisted of the ten largest cable companies in each major geographic area 
in most markets  a small number of large cable operators often provide services to a majority of the subscribers in a specific region and thus influence the purchase decisions of smaller cable operators 
in north america  three of the largest cable operators  rogers cable inc formerly rogers cablesystems limited  shaw communications inc  and tca cable tv  inc a subsidiary of cox communications  inc  are deploying the teracomm system 
in japan  through our partner sumitomo corporation  we have established ourselves as the market leader 
in europe  our teracomm system is being deployed by upc  one of europe s largest broadband communications companies 
as a result of the nature of the cable industry and our strategic focus  a small number of customers have accounted for the majority of our revenues to date  and we expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be generated from a small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
in  four customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
this compares to approximately of our revenues from three customers in we anticipate that the timing and maturity of these customers deployments of the teracomm system will result in variations in revenues generated from these customers 
the market for broadband access products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
a significant element of our strategy is to advance industry standards and to extend our technology leadership and achieve rapid time to market 
in november  cablelabs selected us to co author docsis  an enhanced version of the docsis cable modem specification based in part on our s cdma technology 
in september  cablelabs indicated that it intended to proceed with the advanced phy work on two parallel tracks one for the development of a prototype based on our s cdma technology and one for the inclusion of advanced tdma technology  as proposed by other companies 
in february  cablelabs further clarified the status of the advanced phy project regarding a separate release that will include tdma technologies 
in addition  cablelabs reiterated that it is continuing to work with us on the development of a docsis specification that could include our s cdma technology 
to that end  cablelabs has requested that we submit a prototype of a docsis system that incorporates an s cdma advanced phy capability for testing 
cablelabs has stated that if the testing of this prototype reveals that the s cdma advanced phy works as claimed including proper backwards compatibility and coexistence with the other aspects of docsis  and if the costs for adding s cdma to docsis products are in line with estimates  then it is likely that s cdma advanced phy capabilities will be included in a future version of the docsis specification 
the prototype we submit to cablelabs may fail to demonstrate the level of performance that cablelabs seeks  even if it does meet performance expectations there can be no guarantee that cablelabs will incorporate the technology into a future version of docsis specifications 
in addition  if cablelabs does proceed to include s cdma in a future docsis specification  there can be no guarantee that the docsis s cdma specification will be the same as the specification we incorporated in the prototype submitted for tests  which may require us to further develop our prototype 

we intend to develop future products that are standards compliant and are actively participating in the development of additional industry standards 
as part of our efforts to offer standards compliant products we introduced a cablelabs certified docsis cable modem to the market in the third quarter of the rapid evolution of broadband has resulted in cable television operators  providers of telephone service and other service providers seeking to provide a bundle of voice  data and video services to their residential and commercial subscribers over existing and new infrastructures 
consistent with our objective to be a leading provider of broadband access systems  through a series of recent acquisitions  we are building a complete portfolio of broadband products to support high speed delivery of voice  data and video services over cable  copper wire dsl and wireless 
in the fall of  we acquired imedia corporation and the cherrypicker digital video management system 
in november  we completed our acquisition of radwiz ltd  a provider of communication access systems based on high speed ip routing  integrated with telephony  and on january  we completed our acquisition of telegate ltd  a developer and manufacturer of telephony and data access platforms that are deployed by service providers to deliver efficient carrier class voice services over cable 
in addition  in february  we entered into definitive agreements to acquire the access network electronics division ane of tyco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of tyco international ltd  and combox ltd 
in march we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets of internet telecom ltd 
and an agreement to acquire ultracom ltd 
the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband access systems has resulted in significant price erosion over time 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on our unit asp or average selling price 
we had negative gross margins from inception until the fourth quarter of when we achieved a positive gross margin for the first time as a result of our execution of cost reduction strategies 
a key component of our strategy is to decrease the cost of manufacturing our products to improve our gross margins 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we introduced a cable modem using a single board design  which has higher gross margins than our original dual board design 
subsequently  we have successfully introduced several cost reduced versions of the single board modem that have allowed us to continue to improve gross margin performance despite ongoing asp declines 
we intend to continue to engage in and implement cost reduction efforts  including the further integration of asic components  other design changes and manufacturing efficiencies 
we sustained net losses applicable to common stockholders of million in  million in and million in as a result  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future sales  and we expect that a significant portion of our expenses will be committed in advance of sales 
we expect to continue to increase our expenditures in technical development and sales and marketing as we engage in activities related to product enhancement  cost reduction and increasing market penetration 
additionally  we expect to increase our capital expenditures and other operating expenses in order to support and expand our operations 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures and approximately to million on research and development during the months ended december  anticipated capital expenditures consist of purchases of additional test equipment to support higher levels of production and computer hardware  furniture and leasehold improvements for expansion of our facilities  implementation of an erp system and software and equipment for newly hired employees 
as a result of these anticipated increased operating expenses  we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
acquisition of imedia corporation and radwiz ltd 
in september  we acquired imedia corporation 
imedia developed and manufactured the cherrypicker digital video management system that enables cable operators to select and customize their program lineup for viewer preferences  while maximizing video capacity and quality over standards based set top boxes 
the former shareholders and vested optionholders of imedia received a total of million shares and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in november  we acquired radwiz ltd  an israeli company that produces communication access systems based on high speed ip routing  integrated with telephony 
radwiz s systems include both central office digital subscriber line access multiplexers dslams and customer premises equipment for small office  home office soho business broadband services 
the former shareholders and vested optionholders of radwiz received a total of  shares and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the radwiz acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
this report on form k presents our financial results for the year ended december  combined results with imedia for the portion of the period following september  and radwiz ltd for the portion of the period following november  as a result  the information contained herein may not be comparable to results in previous years 
recent events in october  we entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire telegate ltd  an israeli company 
telegate produces telephony and data access platforms that are deployed by service providers to deliver efficient carrier class voice services over cable 
telegate also provides in home networking capability for telephony and data  based on the digital enhanced cordless telephony dect standard 
this transaction closed on january  the former shareholders and vested optionholders of telegate received a total of  shares and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
in addition  the former shareholders are to receive a cash payment of approximately million 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
we expect to account for the acquisition as a purchase transaction 
in february  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of ane which produces dsl systems that provide multiple phone lines over the existing copper telephony a single pair of copper wires 
in general  we will issue shares and options to purchase shares of our common stock valued at approximately million based on the volume weighted average of the per share sales price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the closing date 
in addition  we have agreed to establish an employee retention program for purposes of retaining certain identified employees of ane 
the retention program provides for up to annual payments to the identified employees in a total amount of approximately million provided the employees remain employed by us 
the retention payments will be charged to expense in the period incurred 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of we expect to account for the acquisition as a purchase transaction 
in february  we also entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire combox ltd  an israeli company that manufactures broadband data systems and satellite communications based on international standards 
combox s cable data access systems conform to the growing euromodem international specification  based on the digital video broadcasting dvb standard 
in general  combox shareholders will receive a total of  shares and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
based on the fair market value of our stock on the days immediately preceding and following the date the acquisition was announced  the total purchase price is estimated to be approximately million 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of we expect to account for the acquisition as a purchase transaction 
in february  our board of directors approved a two for one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock split is pending stockholder approval of an increase in our authorized shares and therefore the changes in the capital structure resulting from the split have not been given retroactive effect throughout this report on form k 
in march  we entered into an asset purchase agreement internet telecom agreement with our subsidiary telegate  under which telegate agreed to purchase certain assets of internet telecom ltd 
internet telecom  an israeli company 
internet telecom is a supplier of packetcable and other standards based  voice over ip internet protocol systems and technologies 
in general  telegate will acquire the assets of internet telecom in exchange for shares our common stock valued at approximately million based on the fair market value of our common stock on the days immediately preceding and following the date the acquisition was announced and a cash payment estimated at approximately million 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter 
we expect to account for the transaction as a purchase transaction 
in march  we entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire ultracom ltd 
ultracom  an israeli company 
ultracom is a supplier of broadband systems on silicon 
in general the ultracom shareholders and vested optionholders will receive shares and option of our common stock valued at approximately million based on the closing price of our common stock on the fifth business day immediately preceding the closing and a cash payment estimated at approximately million 
we will also assume the unvested ultracom options  the value of which will be included in the purchase price 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter 
we expect to account for the transaction as a purchase transaction 
in march  rogers purchased  shares of our common stock 
the shares were issued on a net issuance basis pursuant to the exercise of two warrants  each to purchase million shares of our common stock issued in march because the warrants were exercised on a cashless basis the exercise resulted in no proceeds to us 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
our revenues increased to million in from million in revenues consist primarily of sales of cable modems and headend equipment to new and existing customers 
the increased revenues in were primarily attributable to the addition of new customers in and continuing deployments of our teracomm system by existing customers  and  to a lesser extent  the sales of products acquired as a result of our acquisition of imedia 
the impact on revenues resulting from the acquisition of radwiz was not significant for the year ended december  we sell our products directly to broadband access service providers  system resellers and distributors 
revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products are shipped to the customer 
a provision is made for estimated product returns as product shipments are made 
our existing agreements with our system resellers and distributors do not contain price protection provisions and do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the company s standard warranty 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing operations group 
the cost of the manufacturing operations group includes assembly  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in  we incurred million in cost of goods sold  which included the cost of our manufacturing operations group and approximately million of amortization of intangibles assets resulting from the acquisitions of imedia and radwiz 
in  we incurred million in cost of goods sold  which included the cost our manufacturing operations group and a charge of million relating to the write off of obsolete inventory and the transition of manufacturing operations 
gross profit loss 
our gross profit was million or of revenue in this compares to a gross loss of million in the improvement in our gross profit in compared to was due largely to the introduction of a cable modem using a single board design in the fourth quarter of this modem has a higher gross margin than our original dual board design 
subsequent to the introduction of the single board design  we have successfully introduced cost reduced versions that have allowed us to continue to improve gross margin 
we intend to continue to engage in and implement cost reduction efforts  including the further integration of asic components  other design changes and manufacturing efficiencies 
we anticipate that continued decreases in the average sales price of our products will partially  if not completely  offset the benefits obtained from further cost reductions  particularly if we are unable to achieve cost reductions sufficient to offset further average selling price declines 
our gross profit also is influenced by the sales mix of teralink master controllers  teralink gateways and terapro cable modems and the maturity of teracomm system deployments in any quarter 
terapro cable modems have lower margins than the teralink master controllers and teralink gateway headend products 
new deployments of teracomm systems typically include a higher mix of headend equipment and involve smaller quantities of product sold 
products sold in connection with new deployments thus generally are sold at higher margins than products associated with more mature deployments of the teracomm system  which generally involve larger quantities of products  primarily cable modems 
we expect that the introduction of new customers and the relationship of revenues generated from the sale of terapro cable modems to our overall revenue will result in fluctuations in our gross profit in future periods 
we introduced a cablelabs certified doscis cable modem to the market in third quarter of we also are currently developing a docsis system that will include a headend controller 
we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards will result in further price pressure 
we anticipate that the relationship of revenues generated from the sale of our proprietary teracomm system versus a docsis compliant system will result in fluctuations in our gross profit in future periods 
the impact on our gross margin in resulting from the sale of our docsis cable modem was not significant 
our gross margin also is influenced by the level of sales of products of acquired companies  which produce varying gross margin results 
we expect that our gross margin will fluctuate in future periods as a result of these and other acquisitions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  as well as design expenditures  equipment and supplies required to develop and to enhance our products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs 
the increased personnel costs are a result of expansion in our own employee base as we continue to focus our efforts on developing new products and enhancing our current products 
the increased personnel costs are also the result of the acquisitions of imedia and radwiz 
we intend to continue to increase investment in research and development as a result of these and other activities 
cost of product development assistance agreement 
in march  we entered into a one year product development assistance agreement with rogers communications inc under the terms of the development agreement  rogers will assist us with the characterization and testing of our subscriber end and head end voice over cable equipment 
in addition  rogers will provide us with technology to assist us with our efforts to develop high quality  field proven technology solutions that are docsis compliant and packet cable compliant 
the development agreement has a term of one year 
in consideration of rogers entering into the development agreement  we issued rogers two fully vested and non forfeitable warrants  each to purchase million shares of common stock on a cashless basis 
one warrant has an exercise price of per share and one warrant has an exercise price of per share 
the warrants may be exercised at any time in full or in part through march  the fair value of the two warrants was approximately million and will result in a noncash charge included in operations over the one year term of the development agreement 
as a result of the development agreement  our results for include a noncash charge of million 
in march  rogers purchased  shares of our common stock on a net exercise basis  resulting in no proceeds to us 
in process research and development 
we incurred charges of million for the year ended december  related to research and development projects in process at imedia at the time of the acquisition and million related to research and development project in process at radwiz at the time of the acquisition 
the projects identified as in process will require additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility 
these projects have identifiable technological risk factors that indicate that even though successful completion is expected  it is not assured 
in process technology resulting from the acquisition of imedia consists primarily of major additions to imedia s core technology  which is related to imedia s planned development of new features 
the majority of the intended functionality of these new features is not supported by imedia s current technology 
intended new features include offering high quality video service over the internet and multiplexing data with video 
we expect that in process technology will be successfully developed and that initial benefits from these projects will begin in however  there remain significant technical challenges that must be resolved in order to complete the in process technology 
in process technology resulting from the acquisition of radwiz consists primarily of major additions to radwiz s core technology  which is related to radwiz s planned development of new features 
the majority of the intended functionality of these new features is not supported by radwiz s current technology 
intended new features include offering end to end carrier quality of service  allowing access via an atm network  and  providing isdn line functionality 
we expect that in process technology will be successfully developed and that initial benefits from these projects will begin in mid year however  significant technical challenges must be resolved in order to complete the in process technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for sales  marketing and support personnel  and costs related to trade shows  consulting and travel 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased payroll costs related to additional sales and support personnel necessary to support the expansion of our customer base and resulting from the acquisitions of imedia and radwiz  and increased commissions related to higher sales 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our customer base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary and benefits for administrative officers and support personnel  travel expenses  legal  accounting and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of costs associated with the increased infrastructure required to support our expanded activities and due to increased personnel costs associated with our acquisitions of imedia and radwiz 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the near term as a result of these factors 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the imedia acquisition was completed on september  and was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the total purchase price  representing the fair value of our shares issued and transaction and direct acquisition costs  was approximately million 
the purchase price was allocated based on an independent appraisal between the net tangible assets of imedia on the date of acquisition approximately  in process research and development approximately million and intangible assets acquired approximately million 
intangible assets consist of developed technology approximately million  assembled workforce approximately million  trademark approximately million and goodwill approximately million 
the intangible assets will be amortized straight line over lives ranging from two to six years 
the amortization of developed technology will impact cost of goods sold in future periods 
the amortization of the other intangibles will principally impact operating expenses in future periods 
the radwiz acquisition was completed on november  and was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the total purchase price  representing the fair value of our shares issued and transaction and direct acquisition costs  was approximately million 
the purchase price was allocated based on an independent appraisal between the net tangible assets of imedia on the date of acquisition approximately million  in process research and development approximately million and net intangible assets acquired approximately million 
intangible assets consist of developed technology approximately million  assembled workforce approximately million  trademark approximately million and goodwill approximately million 
goodwill has been increased and deferred tax liabilities have been recorded in the amount of approximately million to reflect the net tax effect of the book tax basis differences in the acquired intangibles  excluding goodwill and in process research and development 
deferred tax assets have been realized based on the projected reversal of taxable temporary differences and have been netted against deferred tax liabilities for purposes of allocating the purchase price 
the intangible assets will be amortized straight line over lives ranging from two to six years 
the amortization of developed technology will impact cost of goods sold in future periods 
the amortization of the other intangibles will principally impact operating expenses in future periods 
we expect amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisitions of imedia and radwiz  as well as subsequent acquisitions  to increase in future periods 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to million in from  in  primarily as a result of higher average cash balances subsequent to our public offering in january series f convertible preferred stock dividend 
we recorded a dividend of million in the dividend represented the fair value of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock the shaw warrant  and was recorded under the provision of eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrant was issued in connection with the sale of million of convertible preferred stock to shaw 
shaw purchased  shares of common stock in march and  shares of our common stock in november under the terms of the shaw warrant resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
income taxes 
we have generated operating losses since our inception 
due to our inability to recognize a benefit from these operating losses we have no provision for income taxes in and  we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the company s historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses for the prior three years  the company has provided a full valuation against its net deferred tax assets as of december  and we intend to evaluate our ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
as of december   we had recorded deferred compensation of million related to certain stock options granted in and we amortized approximately  of the deferred compensation in   in and  in the remainder will be amortized over the related vesting period of the stock options 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and revenues 
our revenues increased to million in from million in revenues consist primarily of sales of cable modems and headend equipment to new and existing customers 
we did not commence selling our products until june and did not commence selling our products in volume until the first quarter of cost of goods sold 
in  we incurred million in cost of goods sold  which included the costs our manufacturing operations group and a charge of million relating to the write off of obsolete inventory and the transition of manufacturing operations 
in  we incurred million in cost of goods sold  which included the cost of the manufacturing group for the entire period as we readied our products for commercialization 
gross loss 
we incurred a gross loss of million in in  we incurred a gross loss of million due to costs associated with our manufacturing operations group 
the decrease in gross loss in compared to was primarily due to a reduced negative margin on cable modems  which was partially offset by the million write off relating to obsolete inventory and the transition of manufacturing operations to solectron 
we completed the transition to a lower cost  single board modem product in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of this lower cost product  we achieved a positive gross margin of  in the fourth quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a result of the timing of our development projects 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased payroll costs related to additional sales and support personnel for commercial trials and deployment of our products and increased commissions related to higher sales in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily a result of the additional reporting requirements imposed on us as a public company and increased infrastructure to support our expanded activities 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to  in from  in  primarily as a result of higher average cash balances subsequent to our initial public offering in august series f convertible preferred stock dividend 
we recorded a dividend of million in the dividend represents the fair value the shaw warrant 
the shaw warrant was issued in connection with the sale of million of convertible preferred stock to shaw the shaw financing 
our accounting conclusion was that the sale of preferred stock was  in substance  a financing transaction and not the issuance of equity instruments in exchange for goods or services 
income taxes 
we have not generated operating losses since inception 
due to our inability to recognize a benefit from these operating losses we have no provision for income taxes in and we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and have been established to reflect these uncertainties 
stock based compensation 
as of december   we had recorded deferred compensation of million related to certain stock options granted in and we amortized approximately  of the deferred compensation in and  in the remainder will be amortized over the related vesting period of the stock options 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have met our liquidity needs since inception through december  primarily through private sales of preferred stock  an initial public offering completed in august and a public offering completed in january the private sales of preferred stock resulted in aggregate proceeds to us  before deduction of issuance costs  of million 
the initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share resulted in net proceeds of million 
the public offering of  shares of our common stock and the exercise of the over allotment option of  shares of new common stock at a price of completed in january resulted in net proceeds of million 
on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a offering price of per share 
of the  shares  we sold  shares and certain selling stockholders sold  shares 
we received net proceeds of million  after the underwriting discount of approximately million and offering expenses of approximately  the proceeds from this offering have been designated for general corporate purposes 
on february   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase  additional shares of common stock to cover over allotments  of which  shares were purchased from us and  shares were purchased from certain selling stockholders 
our net proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option were million 
in march  shaw purchased  shares of our common stock at per share and in november shaw purchased an additional  shares of our common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
the shares were purchased pursuant to the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock issued to shaw in we have used cash in operating activities of million since our inception through december  cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities was million in and million in investment activities in and consisted primarily of the purchase of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities  primarily from the sales and maturities of short term investments  was million in cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from private sales of preferred stock in  and  proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in and proceeds from our public offering in january  as well as proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants in at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and had available a million revolving line of credit 
there was an unused standby letter of credit of  against the line of credit and approximately million was available at december  our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by outside professional managers within guidelines we establish 
the guidelines  which include security type  credit quality and maturity  are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with short term maturities 
due to the relatively short term duration of our investments at december   a basis point increase in short term interest rates would not have a significant impact on the market value of our investments 
our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale  therefore  we do not recognize gains or losses due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
we generally hold securities until maturity and carry the securities at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
as of december   we had approximately million of unconditional purchase obligations 
we anticipate that we will pay these obligations by march we intend to make these payments out of available working capital 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we may require additional financing prior to that time to fund our operations and we may seek to raise such additional funds through the sale of public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  when we require it 
impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed the remediation and testing of our systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we incurred no significant costs in in connection with the remediation of our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
recent financial accounting pronouncement in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
fas was effective for fiscal years beginning after september  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas defers for one year the effective date of fas which will now apply to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of fas will not have a significant impact on our operating results or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements of public companies 
the accounting profession is currently exploring practical means of implementing the guidelines established by sab to the extent that sab is applicable to us  we will be required to change our revenue recognition policy 
changes in our revenue recognition polices will be reported as a change in accounting principle in the second quarter ended june  the change in accounting principle will not result in any restatement of prior periods but will result in a cumulative adjustment in the second quarter to reflect the deferral of revenue previously recognized for shipments that did not meet the revenue recognition criteria established by sab any such revenue deferred will be subsequently recognized in the period in which the revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue for all shipments occurring after april  will be recognized based on the criteria established by sab we currently cannot determine what effect  if any  that sab will have on our financial statements 
management believes that sab will not affect the underlying strength or weakness of our business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product shipments and cash flows 
certain business risks we have a limited operating history and a history of losses 
we have a limited operating history  and it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we were incorporated in january and began shipping products commercially in june we have only been shipping products in volume since the first quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that we will continue to experience net losses for the foreseeable future 
most of our expenses are fixed in advance  and we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues 
we expect to continue to increase expense for the foreseeable future to support increased sales and marketing and technical support costs 
any significant delay in our anticipated revenues or commercialization of new products would harm our business 
the revenue and profit potential of our business and our industry are unproven 
we had negative gross margins from our inception until the fourth quarter of  and any future revenue growth may not result in positive gross margins or operating profits in future periods 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that could affect our revenues include the following variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  variations in the size of the orders by our customers  new product introductions by competitors  delays in introducing new products  delays of orders forecasted by our customers  delays by our customers in the completion of upgrades of cable infrastructure  variations in capital spending budgets of broadband access service providers  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion in or compatibility of our technology with any such standards  and  delays in obtaining regulatory approval for commercial deployment of cable modem systems 
our expenses generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the level of actual and anticipated business activities 
research and development expenses will vary as we begin development of new products and as our development programs move to wafer fabrication  which results in higher engineering expenses 
we have a limited backlog of orders  and net sales for any future quarter are difficult to predict 
supply  manufacturing or testing constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products 
any delay in the product deployment schedule of one or more of the providers of broadband access services that we target would have an adverse effect on our operating results for a particular period 
in addition  due to the large dollar size of a typical transaction in comparison to our total revenues  any delay in the closing of a transaction could have a significant impact on our operating results for a particular period 
a variety of factors affect our gross margin  including the following the sales mix of our products  the volume of products manufactured  the type of distribution channel through which we sell our products  the average selling prices or asps of our products  and the effectiveness of our cost reduction measures 
we anticipate that unit asps of our products will decline in the future 
this could cause a decrease in the gross margins for these products 
in addition  the maturity of teracomm system deployments affects our gross margin 
new deployments of the teracomm system involve the sale of headend equipment which has higher margins and generally involve smaller quantities of product 
new deployments typically are sold at higher margins than the larger volume sales of product associated with more mature deployments of the teracomm system 
the sales mix of teralink master controllers  teralink gateways and terapro cable modems also affects our gross margin 
the terapro cable modems have significantly lower margins than the teralink master controller and teralink gateway headend products 
we expect to achieve only nominal margins on the terapro cable modems for the foreseeable future 
further  we expect that sales of terapro cable modems will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we also anticipate that our operating results will be impacted by sales  gross profit and operating expenses of acquired companies 
the impact of these factors on our operating results will vary as we acquire additional companies 
we are dependent on a small number of customers 
four customers accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  and three customers accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  we believe that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from sales to a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe that sales to these customers will be focused on a small number of projects 
the cable industry is undergoing significant consolidation in north america and internationally  and a limited number of cable operators controls an increasing number of cable systems 
as a result  our sales will be largely dependent upon product acceptance by the leading cable operators 
currently  ten cable operators in the united states own and operate facilities passing approximately of total homes passed 
currently  the timing and size of each customer s order is critical to our operating results 
our major customers are likely to have significant negotiating leverage and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which we do business with them 
these customers also may require longer payment terms than we anticipate  which could require us to raise additional capital to meet our working capital requirements 
our success will depend on our cable modems being widely deployed and our ability to sell to new customers 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired three companies since september imedia corporation in september  radwiz ltd 
in november and telegate ltd 
in january in addition  in february we entered into definitive agreements to acquire the access network electronics division ane of tyco electronics corporation and combox ltd  and in march we entered into a definitive agreements to acquire certain assets of internet telecom ltd 
and to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ultracom ltd 
we expect each of these acquisitions to close in the second quarter of  subject to certain closing conditions 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to acquire additional businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are strategic 
the process of integrating any acquired business into our business and operations is risky and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
the areas in which we may face difficulties include diversion of management time both ours and that of the acquired companies during the period of negotiation through closing and after closing from the ongoing development of our businesses  issues of integration and future products  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if this integration is delayed or not implemented  and the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public group of companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies 
we have very limited experience in managing this integration process 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any or all of these completed or pending acquisitions may not be realized 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
future acquisitions also could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
even if available  this financing may be dilutive 
the sales cycle for our products is lengthy 
the sales cycle associated with our products typically is lengthy  often lasting six months to a year 
our customers typically conduct significant technical evaluations of competing technologies prior to the commitment of capital and other resources 
in addition  purchasing decisions may be delayed because of our customers internal budget approval procedures 
sales also generally are subject to customer trials  which typically last three months 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of customers orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could suffer 
there are many risks associated with our participation in the establishment of advanced physical layer specifications to be added to docsis 
in november  cablelabs selected us to co author docsis  an enhanced version of the doscis cable modem specification based in part on our s cdma technology 
in september  cablelabs indicated that it intended to proceed with the advanced phy work on two parallel tracks one for the development of a prototype based on our s cdma technology and one for the inclusion of advanced tdma technology  as proposed by other companies 
in february  cablelabs further clarified the status of the advanced phy project regarding a separate release that will include tdma technologies 
in addition  cablelabs reiterated that it is continuing to work with us on the development of a docsis specification that could include our s cdma technology 
to that end  cablelabs has requested that we submit a prototype of a docsis system that incorporates an s cdma advanced phy capability for testing 
cablelabs has stated that if the testing of this prototype reveals that the s cdma advanced phy works as claimed including proper backwards compatibility and coexistence with the other aspects of docsis  and if the costs for adding s cdma to docsis products are in line with estimates  then it is likely  but not certain  that s cdma advanced phy capabilities will be included in a future version of the docsis specification 
the prototype we submit to cablelabs may fail to demonstrate the level of performance that cablelabs seeks  even if it does meet performance expectations there can be no guarantee that cablelabs will incorporate the technology into a future version of docsis specifications 
in addition  if cablelabs does proceed to include s cdma in a future docsis specification  there can be no guarantee that the docsis s cdma specification will be the same as the specification we incorporated in the prototype submitted for tests  which may require us to further develop our prototype 
our future revenues and operating results are likely to suffer if s cmda is not included in a future release of docsis 
we also may incur substantial additional research and development expenditures to adapt our specifications to the version adopted by cablelabs 
cablelabs has not established a schedule for adding the s cdma capabilities to the docsis specifications 
delays in the establishment of a final specification for s cdma in docsis could harm our plans to sell docsis compatible modems and headend equipment 
in particular  if the final docsis s cmda specification is not approved prior to the time when we ready to ship docsis products with s cdma features included  then we may be required to delay the introduction of those products until the docsis s cdma specification is released or to introduce the s cdma features as proprietary enhancements to a standard docsis product 
either one of these events could harm revenues and operating results 
we have already given cablelabs assurances that we will contribute some aspects of our proprietary s cdma technology to a royalty free intellectual property pool  if s cdma is included in a future version of docsis specifications 
this royalty free pool has been established by cablelabs to facilitate the participation of as many vendors as possible in providing equipment that is compatible with the docsis specifications 
as a result  any of our competitors who join the docsis intellectual property pool would have access to some aspects of our technology and would not be required to pay us any royalties or other compensation 
if a competitor is able to duplicate the functionality and capabilities of our technology  we could lose some or all of the time to market advantage we might otherwise have  which could harm our future revenues and operating results 
we believe the addition of advanced upstream phy capabilities to docsis will increase the overall market for docsis compatible products  and as such will result in increased competition in the cable modem market 
this competition could come from existing competitors or from new competitors who enter the market as a result of the enhancements to the specifications 
this increased competition is likely to result in lower asps of cable modem systems and could harm revenues and gross margins 
because our competitors will be able to incorporate some aspects of our technology into their products  our current customers may choose alternate suppliers or choose to purchase docsis compliant cable modems with advanced phy capabilities from multiple suppliers 
we may be unable to produce docsis compliant cable modems with advanced phy capabilities more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
the inclusion of our s cdma technology in future docsis specification could result in increased competition for the services of our existing employees who have experience with s cdma 
the loss of these employees to one or more competitors could harm our business 
docsis standards have not yet been accepted in europe and asia 
an alternate standard for cable modem systems  called the euromodem standard  or davic dvb  has been formalized  and some european cable system operators have embraced it 
we intend to develop and sell products that comply with the euromodem standard and to pursue having portions of our s cdma technology included in a future version of the euromodem standard 
we may be unsuccessful in these efforts 
we need to develop new products 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop  introduce and market new products in a timely manner 
we also must respond to competitive pressures  evolving industry standards and technological advances 
our current s cdma products are not docsis compliant 
we are currently developing a prototype of a docsis system that incorporates an s cdma advanced phy capability for testing and eventual inclusion in the docsis standard 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing the prototype or that the prototype  if successfully developed  will be included in a future release of the docsis standard 
we anticipate that during  existing or potential customers may delay purchases of our current cable modem system in order to purchase systems that comply with the docsis standard 
in addition  potential new customers could decide to purchase docsis compliant products from one or more of our competitors rather than from us 
as a result  our product sales in the second half of may be lower than we anticipate 
in order to promote sales of our currents products we may be required to reduce our prices for sales to existing customers 
this would harm our operating results and gross margin 
as a result of the inclusion of tdma technology in the new docsis version announced by cablelabs in february  we will have to incorporate advanced tdma technology into our docsis compliant products 
if we are unable to do this effectively  or in a timely manner  we will lose some or all of the time to market advantage we might otherwise have had 
our future success will also depend on our ability to develop and market dsl products for broadband applications 
the market for dsl broadband applications is also subject to evolving standards  such as nebs compliance in the north american market  and technological advances 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing products that are compliant with these standards or that we will be successful in keeping pace with future technological advances in this arena 
average selling prices of cable equipment typically decrease 
the cable equipment systems industry has been characterized by erosion of average selling prices 
we expect this to continue 
this erosion is due to a number of factors  including competition  rapid technological change and price performance enhancements 
the average selling prices for our products may be lower than expected as a result of competitive pricing pressures  our promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments 
we anticipate that asps and gross margins for our products will decrease over product life cycles 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards is likely to further erode asps  particularly for cable modems 
it is likely that the widespread adoption of industry standards will result in increased retail distribution of cable modems  which could put further price pressure on our modems 
decreasing asps could result in decreased revenue even if the number of units sold increases 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to asp erosion 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline 
we must achieve cost reductions 
certain of our competitors currently offer cable modems at prices lower than ours 
market acceptance of our products will depend in part on reductions in the unit cost of our products 
we expect that as headend equipment becomes more widely deployed  the price of cable modems and other products will decline 
in particular  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards such as docsis will cause increased price competition for cable modems 
however  we may be unable to reduce the cost of our modems sufficiently to enable us to compete with other cable modem suppliers 
our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures or lead to gross margin improvement 
some of our competitors are larger and manufacture products in significantly greater quantities than we intend to for the foreseeable future 
consequently  these competitors have more leverage in obtaining favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers 
in order to remain competitive  we must significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing our cable modems through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products 
even if we are successful  our redesign may be delayed or may contain significant errors and product defects 
in addition  any redesign may not result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to significantly reduce the list price of our products or improve our gross margin 
reductions in our manufacturing costs will require us to use more highly integrated components in future products and may require us to enter into high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreements 
volume purchase or manufacturing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms 
we could incur expenses without related revenues if we enter into a high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreement and then decide that we cannot use the products or services offered by such agreement 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
providers of broadband access services may adopt alternative technologies or they may deploy alternative services that are incompatible with our products 
the demand for broadband access services has resulted in the development of several competing modulation technologies 
our products utilize a modulation technology known as synchronous code division multiple access or s cdma  while several of our competitors utilize modulation technologies known as time division multiple access or tdma and frequency division multiple access or fdma 
our headend equipment and cable modem products currently are not interoperable with the headend equipment and modems of other suppliers of broadband access products 
as a result  potential customers who wish to purchase broadband access products from multiple suppliers may be reluctant to purchase our products 
although our technology may be incorporated into a future version of a docsis specification or another industry standard  we cannot be certain that major cable operators will adopt these standards 
major cable operators may not adopt products or technologies based on our current proprietary s cdma technology or on any future industry standard s cdma technology 
further  major cable operators may adopt products or standards technologies based on competing modulation technologies 
if competitors using other modulation technologies can incorporate functionality and capabilities currently found in s cdma  the value of our s cdma technology would be diminished 
broadband access services have not achieved widespread market acceptance and many competing technologies exist 
our success will depend upon the widespread commercial acceptance of broadband access services by service providers and end users of broadband access services 
the market for these services is not fully developed 
we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the ultimate size of the market for broadband access services 
potential users of our products may have concerns regarding the security  reliability  cost  ease of installation and use and capability of cable modems in general 
the market for our products may be impacted by the development of other technologies that enable the provisioning of broadband access services and the deployment of services over other media 
widespread acceptance of other technologies or deployment of services over media not supported our products could materially limit acceptance of our broadband access systems 
broadband access services based on our products and technology may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance by providers of broadband access services and end users 
in addition  we only recently began to offer products based on alternate technologies such as dsl 
we may not be successful in marketing and selling these products 
we need to develop additional distribution channels 
we presently market our teracomm system to cable operators and systems integrators 
we believe that much of the north american cable modem market may shift to a retail distribution model 
accordingly  we may need to redirect our future marketing efforts to sell our cable modems directly to retail distributors and end users 
this shift would require us to establish new distribution channels for our products 
we may be unable to establish these additional distribution channels 
if we do establish them  we may be unable to hire the additional personnel necessary to foster and enhance such distribution channels 
in addition  if the cable modem market shifts to a retail distribution model  we may not successfully establish a retail distribution presence 
to the extent that large consumer electronics companies enter the cable modem market  their well established retail distribution capabilities would provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
we may be unable to market effectively to broadband access service providers 
our growth and future success will be substantially dependent upon our ability to convince providers of broadband access services to adopt our technologies  purchase our products and effectively market our products to end users 
our potential customers are likely to prefer purchasing products from established manufacturing companies that can demonstrate the capability to supply large volumes of products on short notice 
in addition  many of our potential customers may be reluctant to adopt technologies that have not gained acceptance among other providers of similar services 
this reluctance could result in lengthy product testing and acceptance cycles for our products 
consequently  the impediments to our initial sales may be even greater than those to later sales 
no established distribution network in the cable modem industry exists that would provide us with easy access to smaller or geographically diverse cable operators 
therefore  our initial sales to larger  more established cable operators are critical to our business 
although we intend to establish strategic relationships with leading distributors worldwide  we may not succeed in establishing these relationships 
even if we do establish these relationships  the distributors may not succeed in marketing our products to cable operators 
some of our competitors have already established relationships with certain cable operators  such as motorola inc s relationships with tele communications  inc or tci  time warner cable  comcast corporation and cox communications  inc these established relationships may further limit our ability to sell products to those cable operators 
we do not have long  well established relationships with those cable operators 
if we were to sell our products to those cable operators  it would likely not be based on long term contracts and those customers would be able to terminate their relationships with us at any time 
in addition  one or more of our current customers could cancel its relationship with us at any time 
we have recently begun marketing and selling our products to providers of dsl broadband services and thus we have very limited experience 
we do not have long  well established relationships with these telephony providers and we may not be successful in establishing these relationships 
we are dependent on cable operators and other service providers 
we depend on cable operators to purchase our cable modem systems and to provide our cable modems to end users 
cable operators have a limited amount of available bandwidth over which they can offer robust data services  and they may not choose to provide these data services to their customers 
if cable operators choose to provide these services  we also will depend upon them to market these services to cable customers  to install our equipment and to provide support to end users 
in addition  we will be highly dependent on cable operators to continue to maintain their cable infrastructure in a manner that allows us to provide consistently high performance and reliable services 
our success also will depend upon the acceptance of our products by other providers of services to the cable industry  such as excite home s home network and road runner  a joint venture between mediaone group  inc and time warner cable 
we are dependent on the cable industry to upgrade to two way cable infrastructure 
demand for our products will depend to a significant degree upon the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable operators for implementation of access systems for data transmission over cable networks 
this involves the enabling of two way transmission over existing coaxial cable networks and the eventual upgrade to hfc in areas of higher penetration of data services 
if cable operators fail to complete these upgrades of their cable infrastructures in a timely and satisfactory manner  the market for our products could be limited 
in addition  few businesses in the united states currently have cable access 
cable operators may not choose to upgrade existing residential cable systems or to install new cable systems to serve business locations 
the success and future growth of our business will be subject to economic and other factors affecting the cable television industry generally  particularly its ability to finance substantial capital expenditures 
capital spending levels in the cable industry in the united states have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we believe that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
the capital spending patterns of cable operators are dependent on a variety of factors  including the following the availability of financing  cable operators annual budget cycles  as well as the typical reduction in upgrade projects during the winter months  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry  overall demand for cable services  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative data transmission and access technologies  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in recent periods  the united states cable market has been characterized by the acquisition of smaller and independent cable operators by large cable operators 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that consolidation in the united states cable industry will have on overall capital spending patterns by cable operators 
the effect on our business of further industry consolidation also is uncertain 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers 
we depend heavily upon the manufacturing capabilities of our contract manufacturers 
the emerging nature of the cable modem market makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast demand for our products 
our inability to accurately forecast the actual demand for our products could result in supply  manufacturing or testing capacity constraints 
these constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products or the loss of existing or potential customers  either of which could negatively impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately million as of december  primarily to purchase minimum quantities of materials and components used to manufacture our products 
we must fulfill these obligations even if demand for our products is lower than we anticipate 
we are dependent on key suppliers 
we manufacture all of our products using components or subassemblies procured from third party suppliers 
some of these components are available from a single source and others are available from limited sources 
all of our sales are from products containing one or more components that are available only from single supply sources 
in addition  some of the components are custom parts produced to our specifications 
for example  we currently rely on philips semiconductors  inc to supply a custom asic that is used in our products 
other components  such as the radio frequency tuner and some surface acoustic wave filters  are procured from sole source suppliers 
any interruption in the operations of vendors of sole source parts could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
delays in key component or product deliveries may occur due to shortages resulting from a limited number of suppliers  the financial or other difficulties of such suppliers or a limitation in component product availability 
we are dependent on semiconductor manufacturers and are affected by worldwide conditions in the semiconductor market 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our gross margin or operating results 
due to increasing demand for electronic and communications equipment  the worldwide market for component parts is currently constrained 
due to the current market conditions  we may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of component parts necessary to manufacture products to meet the current or future demand of our customers 
if we are unable to satisfy our customers demand  our relationships with our customers may be damaged and our customers could decide to purchase product from our competitors 
inability to meet demand or a decision by one or more of our customers to purchase from our competitors could harm our operating results 
we must transition to new semiconductor process technologies 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop products that utilize new semiconductor process technologies 
these technologies change rapidly and require us to spend significant amounts on research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of redesigning our integrated circuits using smaller geometry process technologies to improve performance and reduce costs 
the transition of our products to integrated circuits with increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
other companies have experienced difficulty in migrating to new semiconductor processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we depend on our relationship with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we may be unable to migrate to new semiconductor process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
most of our products are assembled and tested by contract manufacturers using testing equipment that we provide 
as a result of our dependence on these contract manufacturers for assembly and testing of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products 
in addition  as manufacturing volume increases  we will need to procure and assemble additional testing equipment and provide it to our contract manufacturers 
the production and assembly of testing equipment typically requires significant time 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are unable to provide this testing equipment to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in and approximately of our revenues in we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and communications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if our customers are impacted by currency devaluations or general economic crises  such as the recent economic crisis affecting many asian and latin american economies  their ability to purchase our products could be significantly reduced 
payment cycles for international customers typically are longer than those for customers in the united states 
foreign markets for our products may develop more slowly than currently anticipated 
foreign countries may decide not to construct cable infrastructure or may prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new cable plants for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns  the availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the availability and cost of related equipment 
any action like this by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
we anticipate that our foreign sales generally will be invoiced in us dollars  and we currently do not plan to engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we commence and expand our international operations  we may be paid in foreign currencies and exposure to losses in foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
in addition  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to those foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
we may be unable to provide adequate customer support 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to the our broadband access systems  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stage 
to date our sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base 
we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
our inability to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
in addition  our failure to provide adequate support could harm our reputation and relationship with our customers and could prevent us from gaining new customers 
our industry is highly competitive with many established competitors 
the market for broadband access systems is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change 
our direct competitors in the cable access systems arena include cisco systems  com  general instrument  matsushita electric industrial which markets products under the brand name panasonic  motorola  nortel networks  phasecom  thomson consumer electronics which markets products under the brand name rca  samsung  scientific atlanta  sony  com  toshiba and zenith electronics 
we also compete with companies that develop integrated circuits for broadband access products  such as broadcom 
we also sell products that compete with existing data access and transmission systems utilizing the telecommunications networks  such as those of com 
additionally  our controller and headend system products face intense competition from well established companies such as cisco  nortel and com 
in addition  we compete with companies in the dsl arena such as eci  charles industries  pairgain  copper mountain  accelerated networks  integral access and vina technologies 
as standards  such as docsis  are developed for broadband access systems  other companies may enter the broadband access systems market 
the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product performance  features and reliability  price  size and stability of operations  breadth of product line  sales and distribution capability  technical support and service  relationships with providers of broadband access services  and compliance with industry standards 
some of these factors are outside of our control 
the existing conditions in the broadband access market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological changes 
the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete 
our competitors may introduce broadband access products that are less costly  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  customer support and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and access to customers than we do 
the anticipated widespread adoption of docsis is likely to cause increased price competition in the north american market 
the adoption of docsis also could result in lower sales of our headend products in the north american market 
any increased price competition or reduction in sales of our headend products would result in downward pressure on our gross margin 
we cannot accurately predict how the competitive pressures that we face will affect our business 
our business is dependent on the internet and the development of the internet infrastructure 
our success will depend in large part on increased use of the internet to increase the need for high speed broadband access networks 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet remain largely unresolved and are likely to affect the development of the market for our products 
these issues include security  reliability  cost  ease of access and quality of service 
our success also will depend on the growth of the use of the internet by businesses  particularly for applications that utilize multimedia content and thus require high bandwidth 
the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent periods of performance degradation 
this has required the upgrade of routers  telecommunications links and other components forming the infrastructure of the internet by internet service providers and other organizations with links to the internet 
any perceived degradation in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of our products 
potentially increased performance provided by our products and the products of others ultimately is limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of the internet backbone itself 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our products will depend on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion 
our failure to manage growth could adversely affect us 
the growth of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our limited personnel  management and other resources 
our management  personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our existing and future operations 
to manage any future growth effectively  we will need to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain employees successfully  to integrate new employees into our overall operations and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
we are dependent on key personnel 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we are highly dependent on the continued service of  and on the ability to attract and retain qualified engineering  sales  marketing and senior management personnel 
the competition for this personnel is intense 
the loss of any of these persons  particularly our chairman  president and chief technical officer  shlomo rakib  and our chief executive officer  zaki rakib  would harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as needed  we may be unable to adequately manage and complete our existing sales commitments and to bid for and execute additional sales 
further  we must train and manage our growing employee base  which is likely to require increased levels of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
our current management personnel and systems may be inadequate  and we may fail to assimilate new employees successfully 
highly skilled employees with the education and training that we require  especially employees with significant experience and expertise in both data networking and radio frequency design  are in high demand 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have key person insurance coverage for the loss of any of our employees 
any officer or employee of our company can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
our employees generally are not bound by non competition agreements with us 
our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite testing  errors may occur 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns and other losses to our company or our customers 
this occurrence also could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
due to the recent introduction of our products  we have limited experience with the problems that could arise with this generation of products 
our purchase agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provision contained in our purchase agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  but the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products  but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
in addition  even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and management time and resources 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 
even if they are granted  the claims covered by the patents may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without taking a license from us 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with some of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these statutory and contractual arrangements may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries might not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
protection of our intellectual property might not be available in every country in which our products might be manufactured  marketed or sold 
in november  cablelabs selected us to co author docsis  an enhanced version of the doscis cable modem specification based in part on our s cdma technology 
in september  cablelabs indicated that it intended to proceed with the advanced phy work on two parallel tracks one for the development of a prototype based on our s cdma technology and one for the inclusion of advanced tdma technology  as proposed by other companies 
in february  cablelabs further clarified the status of the advanced phy project regarding a separate release that will include tdma technologies 
in addition  cablelabs reiterated that it is continuing to work with us on the development of a docsis specification that could include our s cdma technology 
to that end  we have indicated to cablelabs that we would contribute some aspects of our s cdma technology to the docsis intellectual property pool if and when a docsis specification is approved that includes our s cdma technology 
we would contribute our technology pursuant to a license agreement with cablelabs that we would execute at that time  and which contains the terms that cablelabs has established for the inclusion of any intellectual property from any source in the docsis specifications 
under the terms of the proposed license agreement  we would grant to cablelabs a royalty free license for those aspects of our s cdma technology that are essential for compliance with the docsis cable modem standard 
so called implementation know how is not covered by this license only those aspects of the technology that are essential to implementing a compliant product 
cablelabs would have the right to extend royalty free sublicenses to companies that wish to build docsis compatible products 
these sublicenses would allow participating companies to utilize and incorporate the essential portions of the s cdma technology on a royalty free basis for the limited use of making and selling products or systems that comply with the docsis cable modem specification terayon has already joined the docsis intellectual property pool and  as a result  we have a royalty free sublicense that allows us to ship docsis compatible products which contain intellectual property submitted by other companies 
the scope of this license would not extend to the use of the s cdma technology in other areas  only for products that comply with the docsis specifications 
as a result  any of our competitors who join or have joined the docsis intellectual property pool will have access to some aspects of our technology without being required to pay us any royalties or other compensation 
if and when we submit s cdma to the docsis intellectual property pool  we are in no way restricted from entering into royalty bearing license agreements with companies that wish to use the s cdma technology for purposes other than implementing docsis compatible products  or that do not wish to enter into the docsis intellectual property pool 
further  some of our competitors have been successful in reverse engineering the technology of other companies  and the inclusion of s cdma in a future docsis specification would expose some aspects of our technology to those competitors 
docsis specifications are available on an open basis once they are approved  not only to companies that are members of the docsis ip pool 
if a competitor is able to duplicate the functionality and capabilities of our technology  we could lose all or some of the time to market advantage we might otherwise have 
under the terms of the proposed license agreement  if we sue certain parties to the proposed license agreement on claims of infringement of any copyright or patent right or misappropriation of any trade secret  those parties may terminate our license to the patents or copyrights they contributed to the docsis intellectual property pool 
if a termination like this were to occur  we would continue to have access to some aspects of the docsis intellectual property pool  but we would not be able to develop products that fully comply with the docsis cable modem specification 
also  even if we were to be removed from the ip pool  we would not be prevented from developing and selling products that fully comply with the docsis specifications  but we would not be able to do this with the benefit of a royalty free license  which would increase the cost of our products  assuming we were able to obtain a license agreement for the required technology 
because of these terms  we may find it difficult to enforce our intellectual property rights against certain companies  even in areas that are not directly related to docsis specifications and products 
we anticipate that developers of cable modems increasingly will be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows 
we have received letters from two individuals claiming that our technology infringes patents held by these individuals 
we have reviewed the allegations made by these individuals and  after consulting with our patent counsel  we do not believe that our technology infringes any valid claim of these individuals patents 
if the issues are submitted to a court  the court could find that our products infringe these patents 
in addition  these individuals may continue to assert infringement 
if we are found to have infringed these individuals patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
in addition  other third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
an infringement claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
litigation also may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this means that effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection might not be available in every country in which our products might be manufactured  marketed or sold 
our business is subject to communications industry regulations 
our business and our customers are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission extends to the communications industry  including our broadband access products 
the fcc has promulgated regulations that  among other things  set installation and equipment standards for communications systems 
although fcc regulations and other governmental regulations have not materially restricted our operations to date  future regulations applicable to our business or our customers could be adopted by the fcc or other regulatory bodies 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of cable services and other terms on which cable companies conduct their business may impede our penetration of certain markets 
in addition  regulation of cable television rates may affect the speed at which cable operators upgrade their cable infrastructures to two way hfc 
in addition  the increasing demand for communications systems has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such products and services 
this process generally involves extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have in the past  and may in the future  cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
if other countries begin to regulate the cable modem industry more heavily or introduce standards or specifications with which our products do not comply  we will be unable to offer products in those countries until our products comply with those standards or specifications 
in addition  we may have to incur substantial costs to comply with those standards or specifications 
for instance  should the davic standards for atm based digital video be established internationally  we will need to conform our cable modems to compete 
further  many countries do not have regulations for installation of cable modem systems or for upgrading existing cable network systems to accommodate our products 
whether we currently operate in a country without these regulations or enter into the market in a country these regulations do not exist  new regulations could be proposed at any time 
the imposition of regulations like this could place limitations on a country s cable operators ability to upgrade to support our products 
cable operators in these countries may not be able to comply with these regulations  and compliance with these regulations may require a long  costly process 
for example  we experienced delays in product shipments to a customer in brazil due to delays in certain regulatory approvals in brazil 
similar delays could occur in other countries in which we market or plan to market our products 
in addition  our customers in certain parts of asia  such as japan  are required to obtain licenses prior to selling our products  and delays in obtaining required licenses could harm our ability to sell products to these customers 
our business is subject to other regulatory approvals and certifications 
in the united states  in addition to complying with fcc regulations  our products are required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  we are required to have our products certified by underwriters laboratory in order to meet federal requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
outside the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis or at all the regulatory approvals that may be required for the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
in addition to regulatory compliance  some cable industry participants may require certification of compatibility 
risk of earthquakes and or other natural disasters the facility housing our corporate headquarters  the majority of our research and development activities and our in house manufacturing operations are located in an area of california known for seismic activities 
in addition  the operations of some of our key suppliers are also located in this area and in other areas know for seismic activity  such as taiwan 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business or that of one or more of our key suppliers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the broadband access services industry  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of internet  online service or broadband access service industries  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other internet  online service or broadband access service companies  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of or compatibility of our technology with such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for broadband access services and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
the trading prices of many technology companies stocks are at or near historical highs and these trading prices and multiples are substantially above historical levels 
these trading prices and multiples may not be sustained 
these broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
litigation like this  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources
