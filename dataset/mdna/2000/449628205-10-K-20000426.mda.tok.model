inflation inflation has been a persistent aspect of the hungarian economy in recent years  although the annual rate of inflation has been predictable and has therefore been taken into account by the government and private businesses 
inflation has contributed to the devaluation of the hungarian currency and has therefore had an adverse affect on investor s financial condition 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation in israel was moderate in and therefore did not significantly affect operations in that country 
there was no further devaluation of the israeli shekel against the us dollar in significant rates of inflation persisted in the african countries where balton operates  triggering significant devaluations of certain local currencies

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from foreign operations 
as such  its income is significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and by currency controls 
most of the countries where the company operates such as hungary and several african countries do not have freely convertible currencies and their currencies have been subject to devaluations in recent years 
in particular  during  the income from the company s hungarian  african and israeli subsidiaries was significantly reduced by losses arising from foreign exchange transactions due to significant currency devaluations against the us dollar 
the hungarian currency  which until the end of was subject to a programmed devaluation and floated against a basket of two currencies the us dollar and the european currency unit  euro underwent devaluations against the us dollar at the rate of during since the beginning of  the hungarian currency is subject to a programmed devaluation solely against the euro and has been further devalued by approximately against the us dollar 
since the functional currency for investor is the hungarian forint  these devaluations have resulted in certain currency translation adjustments directly impacting stockholders equity 
furthermore  certain of african countries such as zambia and uganda operate in hyper inflationary economies 
see notes a and i of notes to consolidated financial statements filed under item of this report 
derivative financial instruments are utilized by the company to reduce foreign exchange risk and price risk relating to its heavy equipment distribution and agricultural commodity business 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
israel tractor enters into foreign currency forward contracts and call option contracts to reduce the impact of fluctuations of certain currencies against the us dollar 
gains and losses resulting from such transactions are reflected in the results of operations 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements resulting primarily from nondollar denominated trade receivables and the israeli tax effects of dollar denominated trade purchases 
current pricing models were used to estimate the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts  and call options 
the counterparties to these contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions  which are recognized market makers 
disclosure about interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
