life insurance products the life insurance products life insurance segment offers a wide array of individual and group insurance policies through a career agency force  independent agents recruited through independent marketing organizations and a regional office network  home service agents  financial institutions  and workplace marketing representatives 
individual life insurance products include traditional life and disability products  as well as universal life ul and variable universal life vul  together referred to as ul type products 
the operating cycle for life insurance products is long term in nature  therefore  actuarial assumptions are important to financial reporting for these policies 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
traditional premium receipts are recognized as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
interest sensitive product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder and are not recognized as revenues 
revenues and reportable segment results on ul type products arise from mortality  expense and surrender charges to policyholder fund balances policy charges 
additionally  jp earns interest spreads and investment advisory fees on policyholder fund balances 
reportable segment results for both traditional and ul type products also includes earnings on required capital 
group insurance products include life and disability products sold to employers 
they also include a block of medical policies which are being underwritten by a national managed care company on policy renewal dates  on an as rated basis 
invested capital formerly assigned to these medical policies is being reinvested in other life insurance products or other reportable segments during and  as the company exits the group medical business

life insurance traditional insurance premiums declined and in and primarily due to decline in premiums of group medical products 
individual traditional premiums decreased in as recent sales have been more concentrated among ul type products and improved in due in large part to the acquisition of jp financial 
group traditional premiums declined in and in including equivalent premiums on self insured health policies  group premiums were down and 
policy charges  which include mortality  expense and surrender charges  improved in and in s increase is a result of a growth in average face amount of ul type policies in force  partially offset by a decline in the average number of individual life policies in force as recent sales have been more heavily weighted toward higher face amount policies 
surrender charges declined as a result of improved persistency 
s growth is a result of the jp financial acquisition

in addition to being impacted by portfolio yields  interest spreads may vary over time due to competitive strategies and changes in product design 
policy benefits declined in and in  primarily due to group medical 
traditional policy benefits were of premiums in versus and in and the increase was primarily a result of higher mortality in the group health incurred loss ratio improved to in versus and in and  as claim liabilities are released on the declining block of medical business

approximately million of this amount had been recorded as a charge during the third quarter of policy benefits on ul type products improved to of average policyholder funds and separate accounts in versus in and in the improvement is due to lower credited rates on policyholder accounts and an increase in vul separate account assets as a percentage of these liabilities 
policy benefits include interest credited to policyholder accounts on ul type products  whereas premium receipts on these products are credited directly to policyholder accounts and not recorded as revenues

the increases in revenues are primarily driven by increases in average policyholder fund balances including separate accounts  which grew in and in the increases in average fund balances result from interest credited and new receipts less benefits paid and withdrawals 
average fund balances are influenced by the timing of those receipts and payments throughout the year 
fixed annuity receipts increased in  primarily in the second half of the year  and decreased in the increase was due to significant sales increases through independent and career agents and financial institutions of both new and previously existing products 
the decline in receipts occurred during a lower interest rate environment as fixed rate products were perceived less favorably than other investment alternatives and as potential customers chose variable annuities on the strength of united states equity markets 
in total  fixed and variable annuity receipts increased by in and decreased in fixed annuity benefits and surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances were in and and in annuity surrenders may increase as the portion of the business that can be withdrawn by policyholders without incurring a surrender charge grows

total aip benefits and expenses increased in and decreased in primarily in relation to average policyholder fund balances 
policy benefits as a percentage of average policyholder fund balances were  and in  and the decline in  as well as the decline in premiums in  was primarily attributable to a reclassification for of certain single premium annuity products as interest sensitive rather than traditional products 
this reclassification did not affect reportable segment results

jp s investment policy statement requires an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is a 
the policy also imposes limits on the amount of lower quality investments and requires diversification by issuer and asset type 
the company monitors higher risk investments for compliance with the policy and for proper valuation

collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  which are included in debt securities available for sale  were as follows federal agency issued cmo s   corporate private labeled cmo s   total   the company s investment strategy with respect to cmo s focuses on actively traded less volatile issues that produce relatively stable cash flows 
the majority of cmo holdings are sequential and pac tranches of federal agency issuers 
the cmo portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to lower cash flow volatility over a range of interest rate levels 
year issue the company did not experience any significant system failures due to the inability of its systems or vendor provided equipment and services to distinguish between dates in the s and in the s 
the company began work on the year compliance issue in and completed remediation and certification of all systems prior to december  the company also received written documentation for most vendor provided equipment  systems and critical services 
from inception of the project through december   the company incurred external costs of and internal costs of previously estimated costs to monitor and implement contingency plans were not necessary and provisions for emergency remediation were not required as no significant interruptions were experienced 
since the beginning of the project  costs incurred to remediate and certify systems were charged to specific business segments and expensed as incurred 
there has not been a material adverse impact on the company s operations as a result of it projects being deferred due to resource constraints caused by the year project 
market risk exposures since jp s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
during  year us treasury rates increased basis points versus a decline of basis points in these forces contributed to a decrease in unrealized gains on securities available for sale of in versus an increase of in in  risk premiums over rates that could otherwise be earned on us treasury securities remained favorable for investors in response to heavy corporate debt issuance  especially during the first three quarters 
in  risk premiums widened significantly in the third and fourth quarters 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases  causing funds to be reinvested at lower yields 
the company limits this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio on non callable securities  through careful selection of cmo s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for the company s products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for the company to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
the company manages this risk by adjusting interest crediting rates  at least on an annual basis  with due regard to the yield of its investment portfolio and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  the company s life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest credited 
for interest sensitive life products the minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  the minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
the company employs various methodologies to manage its exposure to interest rate risks 
the asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of the company s insurance operations 
jp monitors the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  giving measurement to the optionality of cash flows 
the company s goal in such analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for the company as a whole 
at december  and  and of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
the company also considers the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments other than trading and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments other than trading include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  debt  and exchangeable securities 
the following table shows the estimated impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would be expected to have on the company s earnings for a calendar year  based on the assumptions contained in the company s model 
management believes that its analysis of the effects of basis point increases and decreases utilized in the sensitivity analysis below reflect reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  and the change in these estimates was due primarily to differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduced to the company s model 
incremental income loss change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points these estimates were derived by modeling estimated cash flows of the company s market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
changes in interest rates illustrated above assume parallel shifts in the yield curve graded pro rata over four quarters 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of jp s current investment strategy and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when issuers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates among insurance portfolios give consideration to relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on the company s existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact as discussed above of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities other than trading 
jp holds common stock with a fair value of approximately of such value is represented by investments in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
the company s exchangeable securities are exchangeable into shares of bankamerica common stock 
had the exchangeable securities been redeemed as of year end  the redemption value would have been see note 
management believes that a hypothetical decline in the equity market is reasonably possible in the near term 
if the market value of the s p index  and of bankamerica common stock specifically  decreased  the fair value of the company s common stock and exchangeable securities would change as follows favorable unfavorable change in fair value bankamerica common stock exchangeable securities remaining equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values

external trends and forward looking information jp operates within the united states financial services and communications market sectors  which are both subject to general economic conditions 
during and  the us economy continued to grow without adverse inflationary pressures 
recently  inflationary concerns over skilled labor shortages and record equity market returns have prompted the federal reserve to become more active in monetary policy  resulting in a higher interest rate environment and an inverted yield curve 
the company s operations are impacted over the longer term by demographic shifts  global markets  technological innovation and overall capital market volatility 
these forces impact jp in various ways such as demand for its insurance products and advertising revenues  competition from other financial services providers  competition from emerging technologies for television and radio advertising  competition for new investments  debt costs  mergers and consolidations within the financial services and communications sectors  and costs inherent in administering complex financial products
