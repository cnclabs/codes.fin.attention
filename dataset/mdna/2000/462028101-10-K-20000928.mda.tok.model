item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results of operations could differ significantly from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors discussed under item business and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on satisfying substantial unmet medical needs in large pharmaceutical markets 
the company is currently pursuing research  product development and commercialization activities in the local inflammation and ophthalmic markets 
the majority of the company s revenues have been generated through the sale of its phoresor system and related active transdermal drug delivery products into the physical therapy market for use in the treatment of acute local inflammation 
since its inception  the company has generally incurred operating losses and it expects to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as a result of anticipated costs associated with a significant increase in internally funded research  development and clinical trial activities relating to new applications for its iontophoretic drug delivery technologies  and the consolidation and equipping of its facilities 
as of june   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on its ability to achieve market acceptance and successfully expand sales of its existing products  successfully complete the development of  receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully manufacture and market its products under development  as well as successfully perform and achieve development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing or commercialization of certain of its products or products in development  as to which there can be no assurance 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to continued growth in the iogel tm product line  expanded distribution efforts and increased market acceptance of iontophoresis 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this is attributable to a decrease in research revenues from the company s collaborative development agreement with novartis  which ended in december this decrease in research revenue is expected to continue while the company seeks new collaborative development partnerships 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting higher fiscal costs due to certain non recurring engineering and tooling costs in fiscal gross product margins improved substantially to during fiscal from in fiscal increased sales  a favorable product mix and effective cost containment efforts in manufacturing operations accounted for this improvement 
the company expects a reduction in gross margin during fiscal due to higher fixed costs resulting from its relocation to a new facility and from the installation of automated manufacturing equipment in anticipation of volume increases following fda approval of new products 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting the company s investment in key internal development programs 
the company is in the latter stages of phase iii clinical trials for the non invasive  site specific delivery of dexamethasone for the treatment of acute local inflammation 
in addition  the company continues to conduct research and to publish and present data relating to the technical feasibility of its ocuphor tm system for the delivery of specialty pharmaceutical products in the treatment of ophthalmic diseases 
the company intends to continue the self funding of these and other research and product development programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in expenses in fiscal included increased business development costs and legal  professional and related costs incurred in connection with patent prosecution and maintenance costs 
expenses in fiscal included non recurring costs associated with the restructuring of the company s field sales force and an increase in certain marketing and promotional expenses  increased legal  professional and related costs incurred in connection with investor relations and sec compliance  increased patent prosecution and maintenance costs  and executive recruiting costs 
lease abandonment charge 
the company incurred a non recurring lease abandonment charge of  associated with the planned consolidation of its research  administrative and manufacturing operations 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase can be attributed to higher interest expense resulting from the increased equipment and furniture purchased under the company s lease line 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal amounts in both periods reflect interest earnings on the invested cash balances 
income taxes 
the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards  which  under the current change of ownership rules of the internal revenue code of  as amended  may be subject to substantial annual limitation 
no income tax benefit was recognized for fiscal in addition  no income tax expense was recognized on the company s fiscal pre tax income 
net income loss 
a net loss of  in fiscal compares to net income of  in fiscal interest earnings on invested cash balances offset a loss from operations in fiscal  in part 
the net loss in fiscal can be attributed to internally funded research and development programs  including the phase iii clinical studies  and the leasehold abandonment charge 
net income in fiscal can be attributed to the interest earnings on invested cash balances 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to higher sales of the company s iontophoretic drug delivery products for the treatment of local inflammation resulting from continued overall growth in this market 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this is attributable to a decrease in research revenues pursuant to the company s collaborative development agreement with novartis  which ended in december costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting increased material and labor costs associated with higher unit sales volumes and certain non recurring engineering and tooling costs 
costs of products sold decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily as a result of lower fixed manufacturing services costs spread over a larger sales volume offset  in part  by an increase in labor and material costs 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures were approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal a reduction in research and development expenditures on novartis related activities during fiscal was offset by increased discretionary spending on internally funded research projects  including the phase iii clinical trials for the non invasive  site specific delivery of dexamethasone for the treatment of acute local inflammatory conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and expenses in fiscal included increased legal  professional and related costs incurred in connection with investor relations and sec compliance  increased patent prosecution and maintenance costs  and executive recruiting costs associated with the company s efforts to fill positions in its executive management staff 
in addition  the company incurred one time costs associated with the restructuring of the company s field sales force and an increase in certain marketing and promotional expenses 
expenses in fiscal included recruiting  personnel and other sales and marketing costs associated with the company s initial investment in the market introduction of numby stuff 
in addition  the company realized increased costs associated with the maintenance and prosecution of the patent portfolio acquired from elan 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease can be attributed to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the company s indebtedness to elan in transactions related to the initial public offering of its common shares in april in contrast  in fiscal  the company recognized non cash interest expense on the million in notes issued to elan in connection with the elan agreements 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  reflecting higher interest earnings on higher average invested cash balances  which included the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in april net income loss 
net income of  in fiscal compares to a net loss of million in fiscal the net income in fiscal can be attributed to the interest earnings on invested cash balances  while the loss in fiscal can be attributed to the non cash interest charges on the elan indebtedness and the company s investment in the sales and marketing of numby stuff  which  to date  has not generated significant revenues 
liquidity and capital resources prior to fiscal  the company funded its operating losses primarily through private equity financing  convertible debt arrangements  capital lease financing  and collateralized bank loans 
during the periods fiscal through fiscal  the company s operating and research activities have been internally funded  primarily as a result of the research and development revenues and license fees the company received from novartis 
during fiscal  the company s operating loss  which resulted from investment in research and development programs  was funded largely by cash flow from its commercial operating business and its cash reserves 
novartis elected not to renew its collaborative research and development agreement with the company  which expired on december  accordingly  the company s contract research revenues declined during fiscal in april  the company completed an initial registered public offering pursuant to which the company issued  common shares and raised approximately  net of underwriters discounts and offering expenses 
as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in a manner which is intended to maximize liquidity and return while minimizing investment risk  and  whenever possible  the company seeks to minimize the potential effects of concentration of credit risk 
the company consumed  in cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to generating  in fiscal decreased cash from operating activities in fiscal can be attributed to the company s net loss 
the company generated  in cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to consuming  in cash during fiscal this increased cash from operating activities in fiscal can be attributed to the generation of  of net income in fiscal as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  as well as a decrease in the company s net investment in working capital during fiscal historically  the company s operations have not been capital intensive and  therefore  its investment in property  plant and equipment during the periods presented has not been significant 
however  the company has entered into agreements with various commercial banks and lending institutions to provide additional lease financing for the company s anticipated investments in capital equipment 
as of june   the company had approximately  outstanding under these lease agreements  all of which was classified as long term obligations 
the company intends to use the available credit under the agreement to fund the majority of its capital equipment needs during the next months 
the company s expenditures for equipment and furniture in excess of equipment acquired under the lease agreements were   and  in each of the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
other sources and uses of cash during the periods included the following during fiscal  the company purchased all rights to the iontophoretic intellectual property owned by laboratories fournier  including patented technology  know how and a year non compete clause  at a cost of million  including transaction expenses  used  for payments on long term capital lease obligations  and received  in proceeds from exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  the company used  for payments on long term capital lease obligations 
during fiscal  the company purchased a license to certain iontophoretic drug delivery technology at a cost of  including transaction expenses  received proceeds of  under a long term capital lease  and paid  for the mandatory redemption of a portion of its series c preferred shares 
in other non cash transactions related to the initial public offering  i the company granted warrants to purchase  common shares to the underwriters  exercisable after april   at an initial exercise price of per share  ii elan converted the amounts outstanding under the elan notes  including accrued interest thereon  into  common shares and  shares of newly created series d preferred shares  at the initial public offering price of per share  iii the  series c preferred shares of the company which were outstanding immediately prior to the offering were automatically converted  on a share for share basis  into common shares  and iv the company issued an additional  common shares to laboratories fournier  pursuant to the antidilution provisions of a prior stock purchase agreement between the companies 
also during fiscal  novartis converted their minority interest in dermion  inc into common shares of the company 
in an effort to meet anticipated future growth and to consolidate its research and administrative functions and manufacturing operations  the company executed a lease agreement in fiscal for an approximate  square foot facility 
accordingly  the company recorded a non recurring charge of  relating to the abandonment of its current facilities 
the company anticipates the use of term loans and lease lines  the availability of which is not assured  to fund the facilities modification and consolidation 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial costs associated with its research and product development activities  including clinical trials  investment in sales and marketing of new product lines  additional investment in working capital  and the cost of consolidating and equipping its facilities 
these costs will be funded by internally generated funds from the company s established commercial business  term loan and capital lease financing agreements  and from existing cash balances 
it is currently estimated that the company will consume million of existing cash balances during fiscal year the company anticipates that its existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company at least through fiscal however  the company may be required or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
the company s actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  some of which are outside the company s control 
additional risk factors future results could differ materially from those currently anticipated by the company due to a number of factors  including those identified in this section and elsewhere in this form k  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
continuing operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
since  the company has sustained losses in each fiscal year  except fiscal years and the company had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  the company intends to expand its product lines  research and development  business development and marketing efforts in the near future and  therefore  does not anticipate being profitable in the near term 
uncertainties related to product development 
the company will be required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities and seek regulatory approval for new applications and products 
product revenues may not be realized from the sale of any such products for several years  if at all 
reliance on collaborative partners 
the company s strategy is to target products that it can develop internally  without depending on collaborative research and product development partners  and where it can play a direct role in the marketing or co marketing of its products 
the strategy will not preclude the company from seeking collaborative marketing partners for internal programs  nor will it interfere with its interest or ability to enter into collaborative research and development activities with prospective pharmaceutical or biotech partners 
however  the company s product development and commercialization strategy will not be as dependent upon such relationships  as it has been in the past 
the company has previously entered into arrangements with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and other parties for the development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing or commercialization of certain of its products or products in development 
until the company elects to and enters into additional collaborative agreements  the company will be required to internally fund all of its research and development expenditures 
to the extent the company chooses not  or is not able  to establish such collaborations  it could experience significantly increased business risk and capital requirements in the development  clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products 
the company could also encounter significant delays in introducing products into markets or find that the development  manufacture or sale of proposed products in such markets is adversely affected by the absence of those collaborative arrangements 
intense competition and rapid technological change 
the drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and rapidly evolving  with significant developments expected to continue at a rapid pace 
many competitors  including public and private corporations  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations  are involved in the development of drug delivery systems  including competing electrotransport related drug delivery technologies 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  are more experienced  and are larger  more established organizations than the company 
there can be no assurance the company s competitors will not succeed in more rapidly developing or marketing products that are more effective or commercially attractive than the company s current or future products  or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
there can also be no assurance the company will have the financial resources  technical or management expertise  or manufacturing or support capability to compete in the future 
reliance on third party distribution 
the company presently markets its drug delivery systems for the treatment of acute local inflammation primarily to physical therapists through a nationwide network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
the company is currently marketing its local dermal anesthesia products in the united states hospital market through a limited number of sales personnel who work directly for the company and independent manufacturers representatives 
in order to achieve broad distribution and market penetration of its current and future products  the company intends to expand its marketing presence through direct sales and marketing or through co marketing of its products with collaborative marketing partners or distributors that have national or market specific marketing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain existing  or establish new  marketing arrangements on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s ability to commercialize many of the products it has under development will depend  in part  on its or its licensors ability  both in the united states and in other countries  to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the patent positions of drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance the patents currently owned and licensed by the company  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products  or that other companies will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of company products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance any of the company s products or methods will be patentable  will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or that the company s patents or future patents will give the company an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in court 
there can be no assurance a license will be available to the company  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  or that the company will prevail in any patent litigation 
there can be no assurance the company s pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patent protection will be secured for any particular technology  any patents that have been or may be issued to the company or its licensors will be valid or enforceable or that the company s patents will provide meaningful protection to the company 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in its product development activities 
to the extent the company relies on confidential information to maintain its competitive position  there can be no assurance other parties may not independently develop the same or similar information 
need to manage expanding operations 
if the company is successful in achieving market acceptance of its products and products under development  it will be required to expand its operations  particularly in the areas of research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing 
as the company expands its operations in these areas  those expansions will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on the company s management  operating and financial systems and other resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  the company will be required to implement improved information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
the company s future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively both independently and as a group 
there can be no assurance the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s future operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the further development and commercialization of the company s products and technology will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct research and development activities  including preclinical and clinical studies  to expand distribution and hire additional sales and marketing personnel and to expand and develop manufacturing capabilities 
the company believes that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company for at least the next months  however  the company s actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  and the company may be required or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek to raise funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and debt financing may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements to raise additional funds may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
uncertainty of government regulation 
the research  development  manufacture and marketing of the company s products are extensively regulated by the fda  which requires its approval of drugs and medical devices before they can be marketed in the united states 
similar approvals are also required from other regulatory bodies in foreign countries 
the regulatory processes established by these government agencies are lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
in addition  once approval is obtained  that approval may be withdrawn 
the company has received approval from the fda on its nda for iontocaine  and the fda has allowed the company to market its iontophoretic dose controllers and electrode products for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs under the fda s k regulations governing medical devices 
however  in  the fda publicly stated that it intends to require manufacturers of iontophoretic devices to obtain pmas for marketed devices currently used with drugs not specifically labeled for iontophoretic delivery  which would include the company s dose controller for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs  such as dexamethasone 
the agency to date has not published such a regulation 
if the fda calls for pmas for preamendment class iii iontophoretic devices  the company would be required to have a pma accepted for filing by the fda within days after the date of the final regulation calling for pmas 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to complete and file a pma within the prescribed time period  or that the fda would approve it 
the company s failure to submit a pma within the required timeframe could result in the company being required to cease commercial distribution of the phoresor for use with any drug other than iontocaine 
any interference with the company s ability to distribute its phoresor system for use with dexamethasone would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
even if the company obtains regulatory approval  a marketed product  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities and pertinent operations are subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility could result in fda sanctions  restrictions on a product or manufacturer  or an order to withdraw and or recall a specific product from the market 
there can also be no assurance that changes in the legal or regulatory framework or other subsequent developments will not result in the limitation  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals granted to the company 
such events  were they to occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company and certain of its suppliers are also required to comply with us and foreign regulations governing manufacturing practices  which mandate procedures for extensive control and documentation of product design  control and validation of the manufacturing process and overall product quality 
if the company or its suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations regarding these manufacturing practices  the company could be subject to sanctions 
under the fda s regulations  when a manufacturer changes or modifies a device for which it has received a k clearance  it is required to obtain an additional k clearance for the modified device if the modification significantly affects the safety or efficacy of the device  or if the modification results in a major change in intended use 
in such cases  the manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the modification is of a kind that would require a new k clearance 
the fda s regulations provide only limited guidance in making this determination 
the fda has cleared the company s iontophoretic dose controller and electrode kits for marketing under a k clearance 
since obtaining its k clearances  the company has made modifications to its products 
based on the checklist developed by the fda to assist manufacturers in determining whether they are required to obtain a k clearance for a modified device  the company has determined that a new k submission was not required in connection with the commercial introduction of such products 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will not require the company to obtain additional k clearances with respect to those products 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
the company may be required to comply with other proposed and new us and foreign regulations governing its current and future products 
there can be no assurance that proposed and new regulations will not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
dependence on single sources of supply 
a key material used in many of the company s current electrode products is available only from a single supplier 
in addition  the company obtains iontocaine from abbott laboratories under a contract which may be terminated with six months notice 
the company also has the right to obtain dexamethasone from luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc american regent laboratories  inc under a contract expiring in january the company believes that  if necessary  alternative sources can be developed or alternate materials can be substituted for each of these single sourced materials 
although the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring these materials on commercially reasonable terms and in sufficient quantities to maintain required production levels  no assurance can be given that price increases or interruptions in the supply of these materials will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to seek alternate suppliers or obtain substitute materials  which may require additional product validations and regulatory submissions 
any significant price increase  interruption of supply  inability to secure an alternate source or qualify a substitute material could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of its products 
the company s current dose controllers are manufactured under a contract with a third party electronics manufacturer 
there can be no assurance that its present supplier can manufacture sufficient quantities of dose controllers that meet quality and performance standards on a timely basis 
if the supplier cannot meet the company s requirements  or in the event of an interruption of its supply  the company would be required to identify  qualify and validate an alternate source of supply within a reasonable period of time 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company manufactures its iontophoretic drug delivery electrodes in quantities sufficient to satisfy its current level of product sales 
to meet anticipated increases in sales  the company may need to increase its production significantly beyond its present manufacturing capacity 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase its manufacturing capacities or to contract with another party to manufacture its products 
there can be no assurance the company can successfully increase its capacity on a profitable basis  or contract with another party on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
significant increases in production volume will likely require changes in the company s product and manufacturing process in order to facilitate increased automation of the company s production 
there can be no assurance such changes in products or processes or efforts to automate the company s manufacturing process will be successful 
the company believes its facilities operate in accordance with the quality system regulations currently prescribed by the fda and in substantial compliance with iso and ce mark standards 
the company has gmp audits conducted by a qualified  independent organization on a regular basis and is iso and ce mark certified 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain such compliance  particularly if the scale of the company s manufacturing operations increases 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement 
the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of those products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations in the united states and in foreign markets where the company s products will be sold and used 
third party payors can affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the reimbursement they provide on the company s or competing products or therapies 
there can be no assurance such reimbursement will continue at present levels  if at all 
some insurance carriers do not reimburse health care providers for use of the company s products in certain applications 
furthermore  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new health care products 
effective october   the health care financing administration adopted new regulations providing for the treatment of capital related costs for medical products 
the company is unable to predict what adverse impact on the company  if any  these or any additional government regulations  legislation or initiatives or changes by other payors affecting reimbursement or other matters that may influence decisions to obtain medical devices may have 
retention and attraction of key employees 
the company is highly dependent on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific  managerial  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the company s area of activity  and there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company does not carry key man insurance with respect to any of its executives or employees 
risk of product liability  product recalls and warranty claims  availability of insurance 
the testing  marketing and sale of drug delivery and related pharmaceutical products for use in humans involves unavoidable risks 
the use of the company s products in clinical trials and the sale of its products upon approval may expose the company to potential product liability resulting from the use of such products 
in addition  the existence of a product liability claim  a product recall or excessive warranty claims in any such case  whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise could have an adverse effect on the company s sales of that product or require a change in the indications for which it may be used 
product liability insurance in the company s industry is expensive and difficult to obtain 
although the company currently has product liability insurance  there can be no assurance the existing coverage is adequate 
the company will seek to maintain and appropriately increase its insurance coverage as its product sales increase and the clinical development of its new product applications progress 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain its current levels of insurance on acceptable terms  will be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of its products proceeds or that any particular level of insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
anti takeover provisions of certain of the company s agreements 
certain provisions of a cross license agreement between the company and alza may have the effect of deferring  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company  a merger involving the company or the assignment or transfer of certain technologies of the company 
under the agreement  the company and alza  among other things  exchanged non exclusive  royalty free rights to certain patented technologies which each party believed to be of significant strategic importance to the potential technological success of many iontophoretic drug delivery applications 
both parties are prohibited from assigning their rights under the agreement to certain named companies or any other entity that derives more than percent of its income from the development  licensing and or sale of drug delivery systems to other pharmaceutical companies without first receiving the consent of the other party 
restrictions imposed on the company s ability to assign its rights under this agreement may have the effect of prohibiting a sale of the company to such named companies or entities  or may otherwise limit the company s ability to capitalize on the commercial and other economic potential of these technologies through a technology license  asset sale  merger  combination or similar transaction 
environmental matters 
the company s research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
these materials  and their use  disposal and handling  are extensively regulated by federal  state and local government authorities 
although the company believes its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental environmental contamination or personal injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company could be held liable for any damages and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
there can be no assurance the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the future  particularly if the company develops additional manufacturing or research facilities and capacity
