such loans have been funded generally by the company s loan production operations or purchased in bulk in the market 
loans funded through the company s production operations have generally been pooled and pledged as collateral using a collateralized bond security structure  which provides long term financing for the loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
financial condition december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments collateral for collateralized bonds   securities   other investments   loans held for sale securitization   non recourse debt   recourse debt   shareholders equity   book value per common share collateral for collateralized bonds collateral for collateralized bonds consists primarily of securities backed by adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans secured by first liens on single family properties  fixed rate loans secured by first liens on multifamily and commercial properties  manufactured housing installment loans secured by either a ucc filing or a motor vehicle title and property tax receivables 
as of december   dynex reit had series of collateralized bonds outstanding 
the collateral for collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease of billion is primarily the result of billion in paydowns on collateral  offset by the net addition of billion of collateral as a result of the issuance of three series of collateralized bonds during securities securities consist primarily of fixed rate funding notes and securities secured by automobile installment contracts and adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
securities also include derivative and residual securities 
derivative securities are classes of collateralized bonds  mortgage pass through certificates or mortgage certificates that pay to the holder substantially all interest ie  an interest only security  or substantially all principal ie  a principal only security 
residual interests represent the right to receive the excess of i the cash flow from the collateral pledged to secure related mortgage backed securities  together with any reinvestment income thereon  over ii the amount required for principal and interest payments on the mortgage backed securities or repurchase arrangements  together with any related administrative expenses 
securities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of million of paydowns and the sale of million of securities during these decreases were partially offset by the purchase of million of securities during other investments other investments consist primarily of property tax receivables and a note receivable received in connection with the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations in may other investments increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase of million is primarily the result of the purchase of million of property tax receivables during loans held for sale or securitization loans held for sale or securitization decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the securitization of million of loans as collateral for collateralized bonds  the sale of million of loans and the receipt of million of paydowns during in addition  dynex reit recorded million of writedowns on the commercial loans held for sale and wrote off million of deferred hedging positions which related to expired commercial loan commitments 
these decreases were partially offset by new loan fundings from the company s production operations totaling million during non recourse debt collateralized bonds issued by dynex reit are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral  and are otherwise non recourse to dynex reit 
collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal paydowns made on all collateralized bonds of billion during this decrease was partially offset by dynex reit adding billion of collateralized bonds during of this billion of collateralized bonds  billion related to the collapse and resecuritization of eight series of previously issued collateralized bonds 
recourse debt recourse debt decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to the securitization of million of manufactured housing loans as collateral for collateralized bonds during these loans and securities were previously financed with million of repurchase agreements and million of notes payable 
in addition  dynex reit paid off million of notes payable primarily as a result of the sale of the company s model home purchase leaseback operations during and sold million of securities which had been financed with million of repurchase agreements during also  repurchase agreements decreased million as a result of the re securitization of the collateral on the previously retained collateralized bonds during these decreases were partially offset by the addition of million of notes payable as a result of additional loan fundings during shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was a combined result of a million increase in the net unrealized loss on investments available for sale from million at december  to million at december  and a net loss after extraordinary item of million during dynex reit also declared dividends of million during  resulting in a decline in shareholder s equity of such amount 
in addition  dynex reit repurchased  of its common shares at an aggregate purchase price of million during results of operations for the year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information net interest margin    write downs associated with commercial production operations loss gain on sale of investments and trading activities    gain on sale of loan production operations  impairment charge and litigation provision autobond   equity in losses earnings of dhi    general and administrative expenses    net administrative fees and expenses to dynex holding  inc    net income loss before preferred stock dividends    basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share dividends declared per share common series a and b preferred series c preferred adjusted for both the two for one common stock split effective may  and the one for four reverse common stock split effective august  compared to the decrease in net income and net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of i a decrease in net interest margin ii an increase in the loss on sale of investments and trading activities and iii write downs associated with the commercial loan production operations 
these decreases were partially offset by the reduction in general and administrative expenses and net administrative fees and expenses to dynex holding  inc and the gain on the sale of the model home purchase leaseback and the manufactured housing lending operations in net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to million  or  over net interest margin of million for the same period in this decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of the decline in average interest earning assets from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  in addition  provision for losses increased to million or on an annualized basis of interest earnings assets during the year ended december   compared to million and during the same period in this increase in provision for losses was a result of increasing the reserve for probable losses on the various loan pools pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds where the company has retained credit risk 
during  dynex reit recorded a loss of million related to the writedown of million of multifamily and commercial loans held for sale at december  in addition  the company realized losses of million  which were primarily related to the write off of previously deferred hedging costs on million of multifamily and commercial loan commitments which expired and were not extended by the company during the fourth quarter of or during the first quarter of these costs were related to now closed options and futures positions entered into by the company in and the net loss on sale of investments and trading activities for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the same period in the increase for the year ended december  is primarily the result of a million loss on the sale of million of securities during and a million loss on the sale of million of commercial loans during these increases were partially offset by million of realized gains on various derivative trading positions entered into during the loss on sale of investments and trading activities during is primarily the results of net losses recognized of million on trading positions entered into during during  dynex reit recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the funding notes and other autobond securities held by the company at december  in addition  dynex reit recorded a charge of million related to the establishment of a reserve for the autobond litigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
during  dynex reit recorded charges to earnings totaling million in regard to autobond related assets 
this charge included an impairment charge on the funding notes of million and million to other autobond related securities 
net administrative fees and expenses to dynex holding  inc decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of decreased origination volume of the company s commercial loan production operations and the sale of the company s model home purchase leaseback and manufactured housing loan production operations during compared to the decrease in net income during as compared to is primarily the result of i a decrease in net interest margin  ii a decrease in the gain on sale of investments and trading activities  iii an impairment charge on autobond related assets  and iv an increase in net administrative fees and expenses to dynex holding  inc the decrease in net income per common share during as compared to is the combined result of the decrease in net income and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding due to the issuance of new common stock and the partial conversion of outstanding preferred stock 
net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to million  or  over net interest margin of million for the same period in this decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of a million increase in premium amortization expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in premium amortization resulted from a higher rate of prepayments in the investment portfolio during the year ended december  than during the same period in in addition  the net interest spread on the investment portfolio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in the net interest spread is also primarily the result of higher premium amortization as a result of the increase in principal prepayments as well as the decrease in spreads between the indices on which the interest earning assets primarily six month libor and the one year constant maturity treasury and interest bearing liabilities primarily one month libor are based 
the loss gain on sale of investments and trading activities for decreased to a million loss  as compared to a million gain for this decrease is primarily the result of net losses recognized of million on trading positions entered into during the twelve months ended december  the gain on sale of assets during is primarily the result of premiums received of million on covered call options and put options written during and gains generated of million on the sale of certain investments

this charge included an impairment charge on the funding notes of million 
it also included a million charge to the company s investment in autobond common and preferred stock to its quoted market value at december  the company also fully reserved for the million senior convertible note it acquired from autobond 
net administrative fees and expenses to dhi increased million  or  to million in this increase was primarily a result of the continued growth in the company s production operations  primarily in the manufactured housing and commercial lending business

compared to the net interest spread increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in this increase was primarily due to a reduction in premium amortization expense related to collateral for collateralized bonds  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall yield on interest earnings assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in individually  the net interest spread on collateral for collateralized bonds increased basis points  from basis points from the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this increase was primarily due to lower premium amortization caused by decreased prepayments during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the net interest spread on securities decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to a negative basis points for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a basis point increase during of the interest rate on the notes payable secured by the funding notes  from one month libor plus basis points to one month libor plus basis points  and the sale of certain higher coupon collateral during the third quarter of in addition  several of the company s residual arm trusts were placed on non accrual status during the third quarter of the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in  primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding property tax receivables during the net interest spread on loans held for sale or securitization decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this decrease is primarily attributable to the funding of lower coupon collateral during compared to the net interest spread decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in this decrease was due to the reduction in interest earning asset yields from increased premium amortization expense and the addition of lower yielding assets to the investment portfolio 
the overall yield on interest earning assets decreased to for year ended december   from for the same period in while the cost of interest bearing liabilities remained relatively flat for the year ended december  compared to the same period in individually  the net interest spread on collateralized bonds increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this slight increase was primarily due to the securitization of collateral which has a lower premium as a percentage of principal  during the second quarter of in addition  one month libor decreased basis points during the fourth quarter of which increased the net interest spread on collateralized bonds since the arm loans underlying the collateralized bonds take on average three to six months to adjust to lower interest rates 
the net interest spread on securities decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the sale of certain higher coupon collateral during the third quarter of along with the purchase of lower coupon fixed rate mortgage securities during the first quarter of in addition  certain assets were placed on non accrual status during the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the year ended december   due primarily to lower borrowing costs associated with the company s single family model home purchase and leaseback business during the net interest spread on loans held for securitization increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to lower borrowing costs as a result of higher level of compensating cash balances during the year ended december  compared to the same period in credits earned from these compensating cash balances are used by the company to offset interest expense

liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources include cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments  common stock offerings through the dividend reinvestment plan  short term warehouse lines of credit with commercial and investment banks  repurchase agreements and the capital markets via the asset backed securities market which provides long term non recourse funding of the investment portfolio via the issuance of collateralized bonds 
historically  cash flow generated from the investment portfolio has satisfied its working capital needs  and the company has had sufficient access to capital to fund its loan production operations  on both a short term prior to securitization and long term after securitization basis 
however  market conditions since october have substantially reduced the company s access to capital 
the company is currently unable to access additional short term warehouse lines of credit to replace maturing lines  and is unable to access efficiently the asset backed securities market to meet its long term funding needs 
largely as a result of its inability to access additional capital  the company sold its manufactured housing and model home purchase leaseback operations in  and ceased issuing new commitments in its commercial lending operations 
the company is attempting to substantially reduce both its short term debt and capital requirements 
the company s current focus is the repayment of its recourse debt  which includes substantially all of the short term warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements 
a substantial portion of the assets are pledged to secure indebtedness incurred by dynex reit 
accordingly  those assets would not be available for distribution to any general creditors or the stockholders of dynex reit in the event of the liquidation  except to the extent that the liquidation proceeds of such assets exceeds the amount of the indebtedness they secure 
as more fully described below  the company was in default of certain covenants in its secured credit facilities and its unsecured senior notes issued in september as of april   the company had not secured waivers for all of the defaults  however  none of the respective lenders had accelerated amounts outstanding as of that date as a result of the defaults 
see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources and notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
non recourse debt dynex reit  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to dynex reit 
collateral for collateralized bonds are not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of collateralized bonds is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   dynex reit had billion of collateralized bonds outstanding as compared to billion at december  recourse debt secured 
at december   dynex reit had four committed credit facilities aggregating million  comprised of i a million credit line  expiring on may   from a consortium of commercial banks primarily for the warehousing of multifamily construction and permanent loans including providing the letters of credit for tax exempt bonds  ii a million credit line  expiring on april  from an investment bank primarily for the warehousing of permanent loans on multifamily and commercial properties  iii a million credit line  expiring on may  from an investment bank for the warehousing of the funding notes and securities  and iv a million credit line  expiring on december   from a finance company for the warehousing of model homes not included in the sale of the related business 
while dynex reit has received bids for the sale of a substantial portion of the assets that secure the credit lines expiring on april  and may   it is unlikely that dynex reit will be able to payoff such credit lines by the respective maturity dates 
although  the company will seek extensions to the maturity dates  there can be no assurances that the lenders will agree to such extensions 
in the event that the lenders declare an event of default  the underlying credit line agreements provide for the liquidation of the pledged collateral 
in such a scenario it is likely that the company will suffer losses on the sale of the collateral 
for the credit line expiring may   dynex reit and the lender executed a letter of intent dated april  whereby the collateral currently pledged to the line is instead pledged to a senior subordinate security structure 
under the terms of the letter  the lender will purchase the senior security  the proceeds of which are then used to repay the remaining amount outstanding under the credit line 
dynex reit will retain the subordinate class 
the security will provide for the full amortization of the senior class before any cash flow is paid on the subordinate class 
the above lines of credit include various representations and covenants 
dynex reit was in violation of certain covenants on the credit lines expiring on april  and may  relating primarily to minimum net worth and minimum senior unsecured ratings requirements  and the receipt of a going concern opinion from its auditors 
dynex reit has received waivers from the investment bank on the credit line expiring on april  for the minimum senior unsecured ratings and minimum net worth requirements 
dynex reit has not received a waiver for the uncured covenant violation for the receipt of a going concern opinion 
as of april   the investment bank has not notified the company formally in writing as required by the loan agreement that it has i terminated its commitments to lend or ii declared all or a portion of the loan due and payable 
dynex reit has also not received waivers for any uncured covenant violations from the bank consortium on the credit line expiring on may  as of april   the bank syndicate has not formally notified dynex reit in writing as required by the loan documentation  that it has i terminated its commitment to lend or ii declared all or a portion of the loan due and payable 
the company s recourse credit facilities generally contain cross default provisions whereby a default under any one credit facility is a default on each of the other credit facilities 
the following table summarizes the committed credit facilities at december  expiring in dynex reit had million outstanding under its committed credit facilities at december  committed credit facilities at december  in millions current balance of outstanding pledged expiration of facility collateral type credit limit borrowings collateral various primarily commercial and manufactured housing may  commercial april  funding notes and securities may  model homes december  less deferred facility expenses total dynex reit also uses repurchase agreements to finance a portion of its investments  which generally have maturities of thirty days or less 
repurchase agreements allow dynex reit to sell investments for cash together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same investments on a specified date for a price which is equal to the original sales price plus an interest component 
at december   outstanding obligations under all repurchase agreements totaled million compared to million at december  as of april   dynex reit had repurchase agreements outstanding of million  substantially all with one counterparty 
dynex reit has provided collateral worth an estimated fair market value of million to support the amount of the repurchase agreement outstanding 
all repurchase agreements with such counterparty are on an overnight or one day basis 
the following table summarizes the outstanding balances of repurchase agreements by credit rating of the related assets pledged as collateral to support such repurchase agreements as of december  and the table excludes repurchase agreements used to finance loans held for sale or securitization 
repurchase agreements by rating of investments financed in millions december  aaa aa a bbb below bbb total increases in short term interest rates  long term interest rates or market risk could negatively impact the valuation of securities and may limit dynex reit s borrowing ability or cause various lenders to initiate margin calls for securities financed using repurchase agreements 
additionally  certain investments are classes of securities rated aa  a or bbb that are subordinated to other classes from the same series of securities 
such subordinated classes may have less liquidity than securities that are not subordinated and the value of such classes is more dependent on the credit rating of the related insurer or the credit performance of the underlying loans or receivables 
in instances of a downgrade of an insurer or the deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  dynex reit may be required to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which could result in losses 
unsecured 
since  dynex reit has issued three series of unsecured notes payable totaling million 
these notes payable had an outstanding balance at december  of million 
the company has million outstanding of its july senior notes the notes and million outstanding on notes issued in september the notes 
during the year ended december   dynex reit extinguished million of the notes resulting in a million extraordinary gain 
effective may   the company amended the notes 
in return for certain covenant relief related to the fixed charge coverage requirements of the notes  the company agreed to i convert the principal amortization of the notes from annual to monthly and ii shorten the remaining principal amortization period from months to months 
monthly amortization for the notes through august approximates million per month 
as of december   the company was in violation of certain covenants in the notes including the minimum net worth requirement and the covenant requiring an unqualified audit opinion 
these violations resulted in an immediate event of default  however  the holders of the notes have not accelerated the remaining amounts due 
the notes also contain covenants which provide for the acceleration of amounts outstanding under the notes should dynex reit default under other credit agreements in excess of million  and such amounts outstanding under the other credit agreements are accelerated by the respective lender 
total recourse debt decreased from billion for december  to billion for december  this decrease was primarily due to the securitization of million of manufactured housing loans as collateral for collateralized bonds during these loans and securities were previously financed with million of repurchase agreements and million of notes payable 
in addition  dynex reit paid off million of notes payable as a result of the sale of the company s model home and manufactured housing operation during and sold million of securities which had been financed with million of repurchased agreements during also  repurchase agreements decreased million as a result of the re securitization of the collateral on the previously retained collateralized bonds during these decreases were partially offset by the addition of million of notes payable as a result of additional loan fundings during total recourse debt should continue to decline during as dynex reit continues to sell loans held for sale and receives payments on the funding notes 
total recourse debt in millions total recourse debt to recourse interest december  total recourse debt equity coverage ratio in connection with the autobond litigation as discussed in item legal proceedings  in order to appeal the approximately million proposed judgment  dynex reit is generally required to post an appeal bond in an amount equal to the judgment 
dynex reit s ability to secure an appeal bond is dependent on the amount of the collateral required by the surety bond provider 
generally  appeal bonds are substantially secured by letters of credit or cash 
dynex reit does not have sufficient cash reserves to fully collateralize an appeal bond or to post a letter of credit 
should dynex reit not be able to secure an appeal bond for the full amount of the judgment  texas state law would allow for dynex reit to present evidence to reduce the required amount of the appeal bond or to provide other collateral for the appeal 
there can be no assurance that dynex reit will be allowed to post a reduced bond 
fourth quarter review the company reported a net loss of million for the fourth quarter of and a net loss per common share of 
these results were an increase from the fourth quarter of net loss of million and a net loss per common share of 
the increase in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in is primarily due to a decrease in net interest margin  write downs associated with the commercial loan operations and the litigation reserve 
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of totaled million compared with million for the fourth quarter of the decrease in the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was primarily due to an increase in provision for losses and a billion decrease in the average interest earnings assets for the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in the average interest earning assets were billion for the fourth quarter of and billion for same period in however  the average asset yield for the quarter ended december  increased to compared to for the fourth quarter of the increase in the yield during the fourth quarter of was primarily due to lower premium amortization caused by decreased prepayments during the fourth quarter of additionally  the average interest bearing liabilities decreased billion to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of the average cost of funds increased from for the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of the increase in the average cost of funds was due primarily to an increase in the average one month libor for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of for the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million net loss on the sale of investments and trading activities compared to a loss of million in the fourth quarter of the loss in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to million of net losses on million of commercial loans sold during the fourth quarter of  while the loss of million in the fourth quarter of was primarily a result of million of net losses on million of securities sold during the fourth quarter of on march   the jury in the autobond related litigation returned a verdict in favor of autobond  and awarded autobond million in damages

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company relies on various credit facilities and repurchase agreements with certain commercial and investment banking firms to help meet the company s short term funding needs 
the company is in violation of numerous covenants under its existing credit facilities 
the company s access to alternative or additional sources of financing has been significantly reduced 
capital markets 
the company relies on the capital markets for the sale upon securitization of its collateralized bonds or other types of securities 
while the company has historically been able to sell such collateralized bonds and securities into the capital markets  the company s access to capital markets in the future has been substantially reduced 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently originated by the company are fixed rate 
the profitability of a particular securitization may be reduced if interest rates increase substantially before these loans are securitized 
in addition  the majority of the investments held by the company are variable rate collateral for collateralized bonds and adjustable rate investments 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds and recourse short term repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have periodic interest rate caps and the related borrowing have no such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company at the time of securitization 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual defaults may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market could adversely affect the company 
regulatory changes 
the company s business is subject to federal and state regulation which  among other things require the company to maintain various licenses and qualifications and require specific disclosures to borrowers 
changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the performance of the company s securitized loan pools 
significant uncertainties and risks 
see note to the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of the company s earnings 
as a result  the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or reprice within specified periods 
the company s strategy is to mitigate interest rate risk through the creation of a diversified investment portfolio of high quality assets that  in the aggregate  preserves the company s capital base while generating stable income in a variety of interest rate and prepayment environments 
in many instances  the investment strategy involves not only the creation of the asset  but also structuring the related securitization or borrowing to create a stable yield profile and reduce interest rate risk 
the company continuously monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
generally  the company adds investments to its portfolio that are designed to increase the diversification and reduce the variability of the yield produced by the portfolio in different interest rate environments 
the company s portfolio executive committee pec  which includes executive management representatives  monitors and manages the interest rate sensitivity and repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of change in both the net portfolio value and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by the pec and quarterly by the board of directors 
the company utilizes several tools and risk management strategies to monitor and address interest rate risk  including i a quarterly sensitivity analysis using option adjusted spread oas methodology to calculate the expected change in net interest margin as well as the change in the market value of various assets within the portfolio under various extreme scenarios  and ii a monthly static cash flow and yield projection under different scenarios 
such tools allow the company to continually monitor and evaluate its exposure to these risks and to manage the risk profile of the investment portfolio in response to changes in the market risk 
while the company may use such tools  there can be no assurance the company will accomplish the goal of adequately managing the risk profile of the investment portfolio 
the company measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its interest income for the next twelve months assuming no changes in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin sensitivity analysis as of december  this analysis represents management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin given a parallel shift in interest rates 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the model considers the effects of these embedded options when projecting cash flows and earnings 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model uses a dynamic prepayment model that applies a constant prepayment rate ranging from to based on the projected incentive to refinance for each loan type in any given period 
while the company s model considers these factors  the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  its projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  the company has made significant changes to its assets and liabilities  and is likely to do so in the future 
basis point change in net increase decrease interest margin from in interest rates base case base the company s investment policy sets forth guidelines for assuming interest rate risk 
the investment policy stipulates that given a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the estimated net interest margin may not change by more than of current net interest margin during the subsequent one year period 
based on the projections above  the company is not in compliance with its stated policy regarding the interest rate sensitivity of net interest margin if interest rates increase basis points over a twelve month period 
approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates to be temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements 
because of the or periodic cap nature of the arm loans underlying the arm securities  these securities may decline in market value in a rising interest rate environment 
in a rapidly increasing rate environment  as was experienced in  a decline in value may be significant enough to impact the amount of funds available under repurchase agreements to borrow against these securities 
in order to maintain liquidity  the company may be required to sell certain securities 
liquidity risk also exists with all other investments pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  but to a lesser extent 
as part of its asset liability management process  the company enters into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and swaps and financial futures contracts hedges 
these interest rate agreements are used by the company to help mitigate the risk to the investment portfolio of fluctuations in interest rates that would ultimately impact net interest income 
to help protect the company s net interest income in a rising interest rate environment  the company has purchased interest rate caps with a notional amount of billion  which help reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk rising above the lifetime interest rate caps on arm securities and loans 
these interest rate caps provide the company with additional cash flow should the related index increase above the contracted rates 
the contracted rates on these interest rate caps are based on one month libor  six month libor or one year cmt 
these interest rate cap agreements expire to the company will also utilize interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in financing rates of assets and to convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate where the associated asset financed is fixed rate 
these interest rate swap agreements expire in interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that the company uses to manage certain interest rate risks represent protection for the earnings and cash flow of the investment portfolio in adverse markets 
to date  short term interest rates have not risen at the speed or to the extent such that the protective cashflows provided by the caps and swaps have been realized 
the company may also utilize futures and options on futures to moderate the risks inherent in the financing of a portion of its investment portfolio with floating rate repurchase agreements 
the company uses these instruments to synthetically lengthen the terms of repurchase agreement financing  generally from one to three or six months 
interest rate futures and option agreements have historically provided the company a means of essentially locking in borrowing costs at specified rates for a specified period of time 
under these contracts  the company will receive additional cash flow if the underlying index increases above contracted rates  mitigating the net interest income loss that results from the higher repurchase agreement rates the company will pay additional cash flow if the underlying index decreases below contracted rates 
the company has not utilized futures or options on futures since  as they primarily benefit the company when expected rates as measured by the forward yield curve are less than current cash market rates 
interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that the company utilizes to manage certain interest rate risks represent protection for the earnings and cashflow of the investment portfolio in adverse markets 
to date  market conditions have not been adverse such that the caps and swaps have been utilized 
the remaining portion of the company s investments portfolio as of december   approximately billion  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are either fixed or do not reset within the next months 
the company has limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate collateralized bonds and notes payable  and ii equity  which in the aggregate totals approximately billion as of the same date 
overall  the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates  and to the level of short term interest rates
