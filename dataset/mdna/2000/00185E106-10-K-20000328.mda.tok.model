item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
description of business the company provides multi channel customer relationship management crm solutions for corporate clients operating in the parcel delivery  financial services  insurance  retail  health care and pharmaceuticals  and telecommunications industries throughout the united states 
the customer acquisition business unit  formerly known as sales solutions  provides customer lead generation  acquisition and retention through outbound sales support to consumers and businesses  market research and targeted marketing plan development 
the customer care business unit  formerly known as service solutions  provides inbound customer service  direct mail response  integrated voice response  help line support and customer order processing through its own customer interaction centers as well as through facilities managed by the company but owned operated by its clients 
in december  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  customerassistance 
com which will provide electronic crm e crm products and services including e 
pac sm  a multi channel platform that supports a broad range of integrated  e commerce based interaction capabilities 
in august  the company expanded its service offerings through the acquisition of paragren technologies  inc which specializes in software based consumer marketing products that help its clients analyze market  customer and sales data on a real time basis 
in december  the company s management approved a plan to sell paragren s software development business 
the company did not believe that additional investment in the software development business was consistent with its long term strategic goals and objectives 
accordingly  paragren was reported as a discontinued operation  and the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and have been reclassified to segregate the operating results and net assets of the business 
the sale of paragren s software business was completed in january as of january   the company operated and managed approximately  workstations in customer interaction centers 
significant clients the nature of the industry is such that the company is dependent on several large clients for a significant portion of its annual net revenue 
the company had one client  a parcel delivery client  which individually accounted for more than of the company s consolidated net revenues 
this client accounted for of the company s consolidated net revenues and of the company s customer care net revenues in fiscal  compared to and respectively  in fiscal the company s contract with its large parcel delivery customer is a facilities management contract 
the cost characteristics and capital requirements of the company s fully outsourced programs differ significantly from the cost characteristics and capital requirements of its facilities management programs 
under this facilities management programs  the customer interaction centers where the work is performed are owned by the client  but are staffed and managed by the company 
accordingly  facilities management programs have higher costs of services as a percentage of net revenue and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue compared to fully outsourced programs 
as a result of the facilities management programs  the company expects that its overall gross margin will continue to fluctuate as net revenue attributable to fully outsourced programs vary in proportion to net revenue attributable to the facilities management programs 
based on the foregoing  management believes that the company s operating margin  which is income from operations  excluding unusual charges  expressed as a percentage of net revenue is a better measure of profitability on a period to period basis than gross margin 
operating margin may be less subject to fluctuation as the proportion of the company s business portfolio attributable to fully outsourced programs versus facilities management program changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain any of its largest clients or that the volumes of its most profitable or largest programs will not be reduced  or that the company would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data as a percent of net revenue from services performed by the company for the fiscal years ended january   january   and december   fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net revenue customer acquisition division customer care division total net revenue operating expenses cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment charges restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting charge of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change discontinued operations  less income tax benefit cumulative effect of accounting change  less income tax benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million 
customer care net revenue increased by million or over fiscal levels 
the increase in customer care net revenue was due primarily to growth in call volumes with existing clients and the full year inclusion of the results of iti 
customer acquisition net revenue decreased by million or below fiscal levels 
this decrease in customer acquisition net revenue was primarily due to the consolidation of certain large clients and the loss of other clients previously associated with iti marketing services  inc substantially reducing outbound telemarketing call volumes available to the company 
the decrease also reflects the company s current strategy to balance call center capacity with demand for customer acquisition services 
cost of services decreased million  or to million from million in fiscal the decrease in the cost of services includes the reversal of nonrecurring telephone charges originally recorded during fiscal the company reversed million in of accrued telephone charges recorded in the fourth quarter of this reversal resulted from the company negotiating favorable dispositions of costs associated with certain guaranteed minimum usage telecommunications contracts during the second and third quarters of fiscal excluding both the charge in and the reversal in  cost of services was virtually unchanged at in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
as a percent of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reductions in workforce and related expense savings achieved through restructuring initiatives and the consolidation of the administrative functions of iti 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  in connection with the consolidation of the customer acquisition business unit  closure of certain customer interaction centers and reductions in the salaried workforce 
during fiscal  the company closed customer interaction centers containing approximately  seats 
in fiscal  the company also adjusted the carrying value of the customer acquisition business unit s long lived assets to their fair value 
this adjustment resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million to write off goodwill and intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of iti 
additionally  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million on certain capitalized software abandoned during the company generated operating income of million for fiscal excluding the restructuring charges  operating income for fiscal was million compared to million before restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal for the customer care business unit  operating income for fiscal was million  or of net revenue  compared to operating income before restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  or of net revenue  for the same period in fiscal customer care operating income increased million before restructuring and asset impairment charges  principally due to increased net revenue and a more profitable client mix 
the customer acquisition business unit generated operating income of million prior to restructuring charges of million in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of million before restructuring and asset impairment charges  for the same period in fiscal the operating performance of the customer acquisition business unit in fiscal was affected by decreased net revenue  the cost of underutilized customer interaction center capacity and higher direct wages  partially offset by the reversal in fiscal of million in accrued telephone charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal while the full year performance for customer acquisition was down compared to  operating performance in the rd and th quarters of fiscal were significantly improved over the comparable periods in fiscal improved operating performance coupled with reduced workstation capacity contributed to the improved financial performance 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by million compared to the same period in fiscal this increase reflects a full year of interest and related debt costs in fiscal on the million term loan used to finance the purchase of iti 
while full year fiscal net interest expense is up significantly compared to fiscal  the quarterly trend is decreasing as total debt levels are being reduced and positive results from the company s working capital management efforts have contributed to increased cash balances and lower net interest expense 
the change in the company s effective income tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal was primarily due to the effect of the write off of non deductible goodwill and asset impairment charges in fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue increased in fiscal to million  up million from fiscal the increase was due to the inclusion of the results of iti since the date of acquisition of may  the company s customer acquisition business unit net revenue increased by or during fiscal as a result of the inclusion of revenue from iti 
exclusive of iti revenue  the company s customer acquisition net revenue declined million or due to consolidation in the financial services industry and reductions in the use of telemarketing services for customer acquisition and retention by the telecommunications industry 
the company s customer care business unit net revenue increased by million or during fiscal due in part to the inclusion of iti revenue and service initiated for a new telecommunications client 
the growth in the company s customer care net revenue during fiscal was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from the company s large parcel delivery client largely as a result of improved operating efficiencies in the management of client owned call centers 
cost of services as a percent of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase reflects the reduction in profit margins due to lower selling prices and underutilized capacity resulting from reductions in expected call volumes in the customer acquisition business unit  and higher direct wages and benefits in both business units 
customer acquisition average selling prices in declined as compared to due to client mix and industry pricing pressures 
the increase in cost of services as a percent of net revenue also reflects the recognition of million in future telecommunications costs guaranteed under two minimum usage contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million or compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of selling  general and administrative expenses from iti and amortization on goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of iti 
the selling  general and administrative expenses of iti include allowances for doubtful accounts of million to fully reserve trade receivables due from two clients which filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law 
despite cost savings achieved through workforce reduction as part of a restructuring plan initiated in june  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the amortization on goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization for fiscal amounted to million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company reviews long lived assets to be held and used to assess recoverability from operations using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized in operating results when future undiscounted cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
as a result of iti clients who provided of iti s customer acquisition net revenue either ceasing to do business or substantially reducing the level of business they did with the company  principally in the fourth quarter of  estimated future undiscounted cash flows from iti s customer acquisition business were less than the carrying value of its long lived assets 
accordingly  the company adjusted the carrying value of the customer acquisition business units long lived assets to their fair value resulting in a non cash impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of the company also recorded a non cash impairment loss of million on certain capitalized software abandoned during the year 
in june  the company adopted a restructuring plan and recorded a million charge 
the impact of the restructuring charge in the second quarter amounted to million or per share  net of income tax benefit 
the restructuring charge provided for the estimated costs to close customer interaction centers  reconfigure certain administrative support facilities and reduce the workforce by approximately salaried employees 
the company incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding the nonrecurring charges associated with the iti business and the company s restructuring charge discussed above  operating income was million or of net revenue in compared to million or of net revenue in for the customer acquisition business unit  operating income excluding the nonrecurring charges was million or of net revenue in fiscal compared to million or of net revenue in fiscal the deterioration in operating performance was primarily due to lower selling prices  higher wages and benefits  and the cost of underutilized capacity resulting from reductions in expected call volumes 
the customer care business unit s operating income prior to nonrecurring charges was million or of net revenue in fiscal compared to million or of net revenue in fiscal the change in operating performance was due to increased revenue offset by higher wages and benefits and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in connection with the purchase of iti 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by million compared to fiscal this increase reflects interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the million term loan used to finance the purchase of iti on may   as well as increased average borrowing levels on the company s revolving credit facility 
the company provides income tax expense on book earnings before income taxes 
the difference between the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal and the federal statutory rate was due to the amortization and write off of million of goodwill related to the iti purchase  which amount is not deductible for tax purposes 
as previously discussed  the company s management approved a plan to sell the paragren software development business 
the company does not believe that additional investment in the software development business is consistent with its long term strategic goals and objectives 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal was million and includes an estimated loss on sale of paragren of million million  or per share  net of income tax benefit 
the pretax loss includes a reduction in asset value of million for expected loss on disposal and a provision for anticipated operating losses until disposal of million 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard number  accounting for derivative and hedging activities this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management believes that the impact sfas will not significantly affect its financial reporting 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth consolidated statements of cash flow data for the company for years ended january   january   and december   respectively 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash cash provided by operations during fiscal totaled million  an increase of million from fiscal this increase was principally due to improved operating results  offset by the use of cash to fund certain acquisition related liabilities as well as funding costs related to closing facilities  terminating unfavorable contracts and reducing the workforce 
the company spent million and million during fiscal and  respectively  for capital expenditures  primarily to construct additional call center capacity for customer care clients and to upgrade equipment in existing centers 
these capital expenditures were funded with cash provided by operations 
in conjunction with the move to the new headquarters facility in deerfield  the company has committed to spend approximately million for furniture  renovations and technology equipment 
in connection with the acquisition of iti in may  the company provided acquisition related reserves of million to close facilities  terminate unfavorable contacts  and reduce the salaried workforce 
of this reserve million has been utilized or paid through january  and million has been taken as a reduction in goodwill 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  in connection with the consolidation of customer acquisition call centers and reductions in the salaried workforce 
the company utilized these restructuring reserves aggregating million and million  in and  respectively 
reserve utilization for employee severance  lease termination costs and telecommunications contract penalties were million and million  respectively in and in addition the company wrote off million in and million in of leasehold improvements and equipment 
at january   the company had received million in nonrecurring customer deposits of which million were offset against invoices for services rendered during fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company received million in refunds from the internal revenue service for overpayment of estimated taxes during fiscal at january   the company had a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility available for general working capital purposes and capital expenditures 
on january   as described in note to the financial statements  the company amended the credit facility  reducing the revolving facility to million 
availability of million of the million total is restricted subject to the attainment of trailing four quarter ebitda of at least million 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility 
the company made million of scheduled repayments on its term loan during fiscal  resulting in an outstanding balance at january   of million 
an additional million in principal payments will be made in fiscal in addition  in january  the company prepaid million on the term loan in conjunction with the sale of paragren technologies 
the company expects that cash from future operations and available borrowings under the revolving facility will be sufficient to meet normal operating needs as well as fund any planned capital expenditures during fiscal year quarterly results the company s operating results in any single period should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results as the services offered by the company are subject to variations in profitability 
the company could experience variations in net revenue and income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
while the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its growing net revenue  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters of its fiscal year due to client marketing programs which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months 
year compliance the year issue  common to most companies  concerned the inability of information and non information systems to recognize and process date sensitive information after due to the use of only the last two digits to refer to a year 
in  the company s senior information technology management under the direction of the audit committee of the board of directors completed a company wide evaluation of the impact of a potential year problem on its computer systems  applications and other date sensitive equipment 
equipment and systems that were not year compliant were identified and corrected through equipment replacement  remediation of code in software programs  or migration to a year compliant platform 
total costs required to correct year issues were approximately million and principally consisted of equipment upgrades and software code remediation 
the company did not  nor does it believe it will experience any significant effects as a result of the year issue 
information regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for certain forward looking statements 
this report on form k may contain forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  goals  would  could  should  and other expressions which indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
if no date is provided  such statements speak only as of the date of this report on form k 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements in connection with new information or future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include  but are not limited to  reliance by the company on a small number of principal clients for a substantial proportion of its total revenue  possible changes in or events affecting the business of the company s clients  including changes in customers interest in  and use of  clients products and services  fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to timing of clients initiation and termination of large programs  changes in competitive conditions affecting the company s industry  the ability of the company s clients to terminate contracts with the company on a relatively short notice  changes in the availability and cost of qualified employees  variations in the performance of the company s automated system and other technological factors  changes in government regulations affecting the teleservices and telecommunications industries  and competition from other outside providers of customer relationship management solutions and in house customer relationship operations 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  the forward looking statements of the company contained in this annual report on form k are also subject to the following risks and uncertainties reliance on major clients because a substantial portion of the company s revenue is generated from relatively few clients  the loss of a significant client or clients could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company had clients which individually accounted for more than of the company s net revenue for fiscal years   and the company s ten and four largest clients collectively accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net revenue in fiscal the company s largest client in fiscal was a large parcel delivery client  which accounted for of the company s net revenue in fiscal the company s second largest client in fiscal was a major telecommunications client  which accounted for of the company s net revenue during that period 
the company s third largest client in fiscal was a financial services subsidiary of a national retailer  which accounted for of the company s net revenue during the period 
in fiscal  two clients accounted for and of the company s net revenue and in fiscal  two clients accounted for and of the company s net revenue  respectively 
many of the company s clients are concentrated in the business and consumer products  parcel delivery  financial services  insurance  retail  health care and pharmaceuticals  and telecommunications industries 
a significant downturn in any of these industries or a trend in any of these industries not to use  or to reduce their use of  telephone based sales  marketing or customer management solutions could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
the company generally operates under contracts  which may be terminated on short notice  most of which do not have minimum volume requirements 
additionally  the company s contracts do not typically ensure that it will generate a minimum level of revenues or generate a minimum level of volume  and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of such program 
the company s contract with its parcel delivery client was extended for three years  beginning september   after which the agreement is subject to automatic one year renewals 
pursuant to the amendment  however  the client has the right to terminate any of the services contemplated by the agreement or the entire agreement upon prior notice to the company 
in the event of termination  the affected services would be phased out over a period of not less than nine months from the notice of termination 
the client agreed to use its best efforts not to reduce revenue for the terminated services under the agreement by more than one third per quarter during the ramp down period 
the contract is a facilities management contract 
under this facilities management program  the customer interaction centers where the work is performed are owned by the client  but are staffed and managed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain any of its largest clients  that such clients will not terminate their contracts before their scheduled expiration date or that the volumes of its most profitable or largest programs will not be reduced  or that the company would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
factors affecting ability to manage and sustain growth the company has experienced rapid growth over the past several years 
future growth will depend on a number of factors  including the effective and timely initiation and development of client relationships  opening of new customer interaction centers  and recruitment  motivation and retention of qualified personnel 
sustaining growth will also require the implementation of enhanced operational and financial systems and will require additional management  operational and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its expanding operations effectively or that it will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth 
competitive and fragmented industry  potential future competing technologies and trends the industry in which the company competes is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
the company s competitors range in size from very small firms offering special applications or short term projects to large independent firms and the in house operations of many clients and potential clients 
a number of competitors have capabilities and resources equal to  or greater than  the company s 
some of the company s services also compete with direct mail  television  radio and other advertising media  including the internet 
there can be no assurance that  as the company s industry continues to evolve  additional competitors with greater resources than the company will not enter the industry or particular segments of the industry or that the company s clients will not choose to conduct more of their telephone based sales  marketing or customer service activities internally 
because the company s primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  the company s performance and growth could be adversely affected if its existing or potential clients decide to provide in house customer care services that are currently outsourced or to retain or increase their in house customer service and product support capabilities 
the development of new forms of direct sales and marketing techniques  such as interactive home shopping through television  computer networks and other media  could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s customer acquisition services 
in addition  the increased use of new telephone based technologies  such as interactive voice response systems and increased use of the internet  could reduce the demand for certain of the company s customer care offerings 
moreover  the effectiveness of marketing by telephone could also decrease as a result of consumer saturation and increased consumer resistance to this direct marketing tool as well as technologies and service devices to screen calls from marketers 
although the company attempts to monitor industry trends and respond accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate and successfully respond to all such trends in a timely manner 
reliance on technology the company has invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized telecommunications and computer technology  and has focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet its clients needs 
the company anticipates that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain its competitiveness 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop information technology solutions which keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
in addition  the company s business is highly dependent on its computer and telephone equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of such equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
inability to effectively implement and expand our internet products and services 
an important part of the company s growth strategy includes providing a full suite of electronic customer relationship management products and services over the internet through customerassistance 
com 
the effective implementation and growth of our internet based products and services is dependant on the anticipated growth in and industry trends towards outsourcing and co sourcing of internet based marketing and customer service operations and a variety of other external and internal factors 
the internet based information and services market is new and rapidly evolving 
our internet strategy would be materially adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow or grows slowly 
internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as inadequate network infrastructure  system failures  delays or other difficulties  security and privacy concerns  and the unavailability of cost effective  high speed access to the internet 
the company s ability to provide reliable  high quality internet products and services is dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  telecommunication failures  power outages  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
any system failure  including network  software  or hardware  whether internal or external to the company  that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness of our internet site could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to our reputation  brand and relationship with our clients 
the success of the company s internet products and services is dependant on the timely development  integration and continued enhancement of our internet products and services including the effective and timely marketing to  and level of acceptance and increased utilization by  existing and new clients of the company  the accurate estimation by the company of the level of need and demand for customer support and service through the use of the internet  the ability of the company to hire  train and retain qualified technology and other personnel in connection with its development  implementation and or enhancement efforts and the operation of customerassistance 
com  the compatibility of customerassitance 
com and other internet products and services with existing systems of the company s clients and the extent of the technical problems arising with respect to obtaining such compatibility  and the introduction of the new competitive products and services in the company s industry by other companies and  in connection therewith  the ability of the company to maintain a leadership role in both traditional and internet based products and services 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of its executive officers and other key employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of such officers and employees 
the loss of key personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company has non competition agreements with each of its existing key personnel 
however  courts are at times reluctant to enforce such agreements 
in order to support growth  the company will be required to effectively recruit  develop and retain additional qualified management personnel 
dependence on labor force the company s industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of the company s employees receive modest hourly wages and many are employed on a part time basis 
a higher turnover rate among the company s employees would increase the company s recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity 
some of the company s operations  particularly insurance product sales and technology based inbound customer service  require specially trained employees 
growth in the company s business will require it to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of the company s costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
dependence on telephone service the company s business is materially dependent on service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of the company s services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could have a materially adverse impact on the company 
government regulation the company s business is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations 
the company s industry has become subject to an increasing amount of federal and state regulation in the past five years particularly with respect to the activities of its customer acquisition business 
the fcc rules under the tcpa limit the hours during which telemarketers may call consumers and prohibit the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call certain telephone numbers 
the tcfapa broadly authorizes the ftc to issue regulations prohibiting misrepresentation in telemarketing sales 
in august  the ftc issued regulations under the tcfapa which  among other things  require telemarketers to make certain disclosures when soliciting sales 
the company s operating procedures comply with the telephone solicitation rules of the fcc and ftc 
however  there can be no assurance that additional federal or state legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  would not limit the activities of the company or its clients in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
several of the industries in which the company s clients operate are subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
generally  compliance with these regulations is the responsibility of the company s clients 
however  the company could be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for its failure or the failure of its clients to comply with such regulations 
the company s telephone representatives who sell insurance products are required to be licensed by various state insurance commissions and participate in regular continuing education programs  thus requiring the company to comply with the extensive regulations of these state commissions 
as a result  changes in these regulations or their implementation could materially increase the company s operating costs 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company could experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its growing net revenue 
however  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters due to client marketing programs which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common shares has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see market for registrant s common equity and related share owner matters 
the market price of the common shares could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual and anticipated operating results  growth rates  progress on the company s internet initiative  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  the loss of a significant client or a significant change in the company s relationship with a significant client  regulatory actions  litigation  including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
control by principal share owner mr 
schwartz  the company s chairman  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares 
in addition  two trusts  established by mr 
schwartz  each beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares 
as a result  mr 
schwartz is able to exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by the company s share owners 
such voting concentration may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of us interest rate changes directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
the company enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes and has entered into interest rate agreements which effectively fix all of its term loan obligations 
as a result  the interest rate on approximately of debt obligations as december  are fixed 
the company prepared a sensitivity analysis of its derivatives assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would increase interest expense by million 
the effect of the interest change on the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant and the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
