item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to december  the company was a manufacturer and reseller of telecommunications network equipment 
in december  in connection with the acquisition of resurgens communication group resurgens  and the appointment of a new chief executive officer  the company reorganized into two separate operating groups 
the telecommunications group provided wholesale international long distance service through a combination of its own international network facilities  various international termination relationships and resale arrangements with other international long distance service providers 
the equipment group provided digital switches  billing and network telemanagement systems  fixed wireless local loop systems  intelligent multiplexers  digital microwave radio systems  cellular base stations and other telecommunications network products 
as discussed further below  in december the company adopted a plan to divest the businesses comprising the equipment group 
in december  the company acquired resurgens  a facilities based provider of wholesale international long distance services 
in connection therewith  a wholly owned subsidiary of mci worldcom  inc  a major customer and vendor of resurgens  became a significant stockholder of the company 
worldcom currently owns approximately of the voting common stock of the company 
in december  john d 
phillips was appointed the company s new president and chief executive officer 
mr 
phillips was formerly the president and chief executive officer of resurgens 
in early  management adopted a strategy designed to build on the company s base wholesale service business and position the company to become a leading provider of bundled voice  data and internet services to retail and carrier customers throughout europe 
management believes that the european telecommunications market has become extremely fragmented in recent years due to the significant deregulation initiatives undertaken and the significant growth projected for this market 
management also believes that this market is ripe for a consolidation of carriers  not unlike that which occurred in the united states during the late s and s 
at the time  management also believed that being able to provide certain of the company s customers both services and equipment represented a competitive advantage 
during and early  the company completed three acquisitions and executed definitive agreements to acquire two other companies in an effort to pursue its strategy 
as a result of these transactions and related initiatives  the company has evolved from a million carrier of us originated wholesale traffic in to a projected multi billion dollar carrier of us and european originated retail and wholesale traffic in on a pro forma basis 
these acquisitions include comm net privately held facilities based provider of may wholesale international long distance primarily to mexico 
it is expected to serve as a foundation for facilities and bandwidth into other latin american countries 
facilicom international privately held facilities based provider of december european and us originated international long distance  voice  data and internet services 
facilicom has invested in excess of million during the past few years to establish an extensive  high quality switching and transport network in european countries 
netnet international acquired all the assets of long distance february international  inc ldi including netnet international sa netnet  its wholly owned subsidiary 
netnet provides an array of telecommunication services to over  retail customers in nine european countries 
star telecommunications publicly held international telecommunications pending service provider with international gateway switches in the us and europe  ownership on transoceanic cable systems and interconnections between german cities 
worldxchange communications privately held international telecommunication pending service provider operating in countries  including the us  us  germany and australia 
operates switches and undersea and land based fiber optic cables in providing communications services to more than  customers 
the company expects to complete its acquisitions of star and worldxchange in mid the combination of world access  facilicom  star and worldxchange will create one of the largest independent telecommunications service companies focused on the european market 
the combined network  retail customer base  sales organization and traffic is expected to significantly accelerate the implementation of the company s strategy as outlined above 
management expects to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions in the next few years to further pursue growth opportunities projected for europe and selected other deregulating markets throughout the world 
the company has used its common stock and new series of its preferred stock as the primary consideration paid for the companies acquired in and this form of consideration will also be used in the pending acquisitions of star and worldxchange 
in december  the company adopted a plan to divest its equipment group in order to focus all its resources on its international long distance businesses see discontinued operations plan 
as a result of this plan  the company s equipment group has been accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  the results of the equipment group s operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
one of the businesses was sold in december for approximately million 
the company has engaged two investment banking firms to sell the remaining businesses 
in february  the company executed a definitive agreement with batm advanced communications limited batm  an israel based technology company  pursuant to which telco systems  the company s largest equipment business  will be sold to batm for million of cash and  restricted shares of batm common stock 
the shares of batm common stock  which had an initial value of million  trade on the london stock exchange 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  the company may not sell  transfer or otherwise monetize these shares for a period of one year without the consent of batm 
the company expects to complete this transaction in april and record a significant gain 
during and  the company has significantly increased its cash balances through two private placements of common stock for a total of million  a private placement of series a preferred stock for million and proceeds from the sale or liquidation of certain equipment group assets 
management believes that with existing cash balances  proceeds from the pending sale of telco systems and available borrowings under the company s million revolving line of credit  the company will have sufficient capital to support the working capital and other cash requirements associated with the integration of recent and pending acquisitions 
continuing operations compared to continuing operations prior to the december resurgens acquisition  the company was a manufacturer and reseller of telecommunications network equipment 
in connection with the company s december plan to divest its equipment group  the company s continuing operations are now comprised of its telecommunications group and its corporate office 
these operations include resurgens  comm net and facilicom from their respective dates of acquisition december   may  and december   general and administrative expenses associated with the company s corporate office functions  interest income associated with the company s invested cash balances and interest expense associated with the company s debt balances 
carrier service revenue 
total carrier service revenue increased million to million in from million in the carrier service revenue related to resurgens revenue subsequent to its acquisition in mid december 
pursuant to a carrier service agreement with mci worldcom  inc see business customers  the company recorded approximately million of revenue and related gross profit of million during this represented approximately and of the company s total revenue and gross profit from continuing operations  respectively 
the company expects the percentage of its total revenue and gross profit contributed by worldcom to decrease in due to its recent acquisitions 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million to million in from  in gross profit margin increased to in from in primarily due to enhanced network increases in routing efficiency and worldcom traffic 
the routing efficiency resulted from access to larger carrier vendors and lower purchasing rates due to increases in minute traffic volumes over the year 
the increased worldcom traffic was to countries which are delivered over higher margin routes and thus increased gross margin 
the company expects that pricing pressures due to increased competition may adversely affect its gross margin in the future  particularly to those countries which currently represent higher margin rates  but that minute growth will somewhat offset this effect with greater gross margin dollars 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase primarily related to only one half month of resurgens operating results in  expenses associated with the operations of comm net  which was acquired in early  and expenses related to the operations of facilicom  which was acquired in december as a percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the decrease is due primarily to the increase in revenue from the carrier service businesses acquired in and as a percentage of total sales  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in the future 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in from  in  primarily as a result of the fixed assets and goodwill acquired in connection with the resurgens  comm net and facilicom acquisitions 
operating loss 
operating loss increased million to million in as compared to million in the increase in operating loss was due primarily to including a full year of resurgens operations and the acquisitions of comm net and facilicom during included in the operating loss for is a million restructuring charge 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased  or  to million in from million in due primarily to increased invested cash balances of the company 
the increase related primarily to proceeds received from a million issuance of series a preferred stock in april interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from million in the increase is primarily related to obligations under resurgens capital leases and the issuance of million of senior notes in december continuing operations compared to continuing operations during  only general and administrative costs associated with the company s corporate office function  interest income associated with the company s invested cash balances and interest expense associated with the company s debt balances is presented in the consolidated statement of operations 
as a result of this presentation  it is not meaningful to compare continuing operations  which includes the results of resurgens from its december acquisition date  to continuing operations 
the remaining income and expense of the company has been presented as discontinued operations

the restructuring charge includes the estimated costs of i consolidating certain of the company s united states gateway switching centers and related technical support functions into existing facilicom operations  ii consolidating the company s united kingdom operations into existing facilicom operations  iii consolidating certain of the company s administrative functions into facilicom s operations  and iv eliminating other redundant operations and assets as a result of combining the two entities 
facilicom is a multi national long distance service carrier focused on providing international wholesale telecommunications services to other carriers worldwide 
facilicom provides these services over its carrier grade international network  which consists of gateway switches as well as a satellite earth station 
given the duplication of network assets between the two entities  including switching and transmission equipment  the company decided in late to shut down and dispose of its six gateway switches located in chicago  los angeles  newark  dallas  san francisco and london 
the company intends to dispose of these six switches and related network assets through sale in the secondary switching and transmission equipment market during the restructuring charge also provides for the write off of leasehold improvements at the six switch sites and lease commitments remaining on certain facilities and equipment taken out of service

in december  in connection with its acquisition of facilicom  the company adopted a plan to divest all of its remaining equipment businesses in order to focus on its international long distance businesses see plan

in december  the company formalized its plan to offer for sale two businesses  i the resale and repair of nortel and other original equipment manufacturers wireline switching equipment  and ii pay telephone refurbishment 
in connection  therewith  the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of for the estimated loss to dispose of these discontinued operations 
this loss  which was recorded as partial impairment of existing goodwill  was determined by comparing the book value of the net assets of the discontinued operations to their net realizable value 
the net realizable value was estimated based on preliminary valuation work performed by an investment banking firm engaged by the company to assist in the sale of these businesses and a preliminary non committal offer from a prospective buyer 
during the first six months of  the company and its investment bankers formally solicited offers for the two businesses 
the preliminary offer referred to above was eventually withdrawn by the potential suitor and the formal selling process generated only one serious offer for the business 
the company eventually refused this offer due to its low price and substantial credit risk 
during this selling process  the company s nortel resale business significantly deteriorated and its pay telephone refurbishment business began showing signs of weakness 
in mid  faced with an unsuccessful selling process and future operating losses  management elected to begin liquidating the nortel resale and repair business 
a formal liquidation plan designed to eliminate future quarterly losses  maximize net cash proceeds and realize significant deferred tax credits  was adopted by management and communicated to all affected employees 
as a result of this revised plan  the company recorded an additional charge of million in the second quarter of to reflect the additional loss expected to be realized on the liquidation of the nortel resale and repair business 
significant elements of this charge consisted of million to write off all remaining goodwill  million to write down inventories to estimated realizable value   to write down leasehold improvements  test equipment and other assets to estimated realizable value   for severance benefits  and  for the estimated loss on the disposal of facility leases 
the charge also included approximately  for net operating losses expected to be incurred by the company during this liquidation process 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the liquidation of its nortel resale and repair business in accordance with the above plan and sold its pay telephone refurbishment business for approximately million in cash 
the actual loss on disposition of these businesses approximated the estimated loss recorded in the second quarter of plan 
in december  the company adopted a plan to divest  spin off or otherwise monetize its remaining equipment businesses  consisting of the following telco systems division acquired november  a provider of next generation transport and access solutions for service providers throughout the world

gain on exchange of securities 
in connection with the acquisition of telco systems  the company acquired an investment in the common stock of omnia communications  inc omnia and warrants to purchase additional common stock of omnia 
the fair value of the investment in omnia at the time of the acquisition of telco systems was approximately million and was accounted for by the company under the cost method

ciena 
in june  the company exercised the outstanding warrants to purchase additional common stock in omnia

purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the advanced techcom  nact and telco systems acquisitions in  the company wrote off purchased in process r d totaling million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternate use 
the value of the purchased in process technology from nact and telco systems was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to in process research and development projects  excluding costs to complete the development of the technology 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
these estimates were based on several assumptions for each of the respective acquisitions 
the resultant net present value amount was then reduced by a stage of completion factor 
this factor more specifically captures the development risk of an in process technology ie  market risk is still incorporated in the estimated rate of return 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and test activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
if these projects to develop commercially viable products based on the purchased in process technology are not successfully completed  the sales and profitability of nact and telco systems may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired

quarterly operating results the company s quarterly operating results are difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy because a number of factors subject these results to significant fluctuations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
carrier service revenue  costs and related expenses have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors 
the company s revenue in any given period can vary due to factors such as call volume fluctuations  particularly in regions with relatively high per minute rates  the addition or loss of major customers  whether through competition  merger  consolidation or otherwise  the loss of economically beneficial routing options for the termination of the company s traffic  financial difficulties of major customers  pricing pressure resulting from increased competition  and technical difficulties with or failures of portions of the company s network that impact the company s ability to provide service to or bill its customers 
the company s operating expenses in any given period can vary due to factors such as fluctuations in rates charged by carriers to terminate traffic  increases in bad debt expense and reserves  the timing of capital expenditures  and other costs associated with acquiring or obtaining other rights to switching and other transmission facilities  and costs associated with changes in staffing levels of sales  marketing  technical support and administrative personnel 
in addition  the company s operating results can vary due to factors such as changes in routing due to variations in the quality of vendor transmission capability  loss of favorable routing options  the amount of  and the accounting policy for  return traffic under operating agreements  actions by domestic or foreign regulatory entities  the level  timing and pace of the company s expansion in international and commercial markets  and general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
further  a substantial portion of transmission capacity used by the company is obtained on a variable  per minute and short term basis  subjecting the company to the possibility of unanticipated price increases and service cancellations 
since the company does not generally have long term arrangements for the purchase or resale of long distance services  and since rates fluctuate significantly over short periods of time  the company s operating results may vary significantly 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for continuing operations for each of the company s last eight quarters 
this information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas as a result of this amendment  sfas no 
shall be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  in accordance with sfas no 
 an entity is required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the securities and exchange commission staff issued sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab spells out four basic criteria that must be met before companies can record revenue 
these are a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
many of the examples in the sab address situations that give rise to the potential for recording revenue prematurely 
they include transactions subject to uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  including rights to refunds and extended payment terms  and require continuing involvement by the seller 
in march  the sec issued sab a amendment revenue recognition in financial statements  that delays the implementation date of certain provisions of sab under the amendment  the company is not required to restate its prior financial statements provided that the company reports a change in accounting principle no later than the second fiscal quarter ending june  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
in accordance with fas  for companies that adopt sab in the second quarter  financial information for the first quarter would be restated by including a cumulative effect adjustment in that quarter ie  the first quarter 
the company believes the adoption of sab would result in a substantial increase in the deferral of revenue for certain of our discontinued operations 
the company does not believe the adoption of sab would have a material impact on our continuing operations 
year issue in late  the company completed remediation and testing of its computer systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in its information technology and non information technology systems to date and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues and will continue to monitor its mission critical computer systems and the appropriate systems of its suppliers and vendors throughout to ensure that any latent year matters which may arise are addressed promptly 
to date  the company is not aware of any year disruptions in the computer systems of its significant vendors or service providers

for example  the accounting rate under operating agreements is often defined in monetary units other than us dollars  such as special drawing rights or sdrs 
to the extent that the us dollar declines relative to units such as sdrs  the dollar equivalent accounting rate would increase 
in addition  as we expand into foreign markets  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is expected to increase 
although we do not currently engage in exchange rate hedging strategies  we may choose to limit our exposure by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts or other similar hedging strategies 
specific hedging contracts  if any  will be subject to approval by specified officers acting within our board of directors overall policies and limits 
we intend to limit our hedging activities to the extent of our foreign currency exposure 
there can be no assurance that any currency hedging strategy will be successful in avoiding currency exchange related losses 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less  in accordance with our internal investment policies 
these investments are limited primarily to us treasury securities  certain time deposits  and high quality repurchase agreements and commercial paper with restrictions on the rating of the companies issuing these instruments 
we do not invest in any derivative or commodity type instruments 
in addition  the restricted cash balance available to fund the next three scheduled interest payments on our senior notes is invested in us treasury securities 
accordingly  we are subject to minimal market risk on any of our investments 
the majority of our debt  which consists of million of senior notes and million of convertible notes  bears interest at a fixed rate 
although the actual service requirements of this debt are fixed  changes in interest rates generally could put us in a position of paying interest that differs from then existing rates 
our revolving line of credit agreements with a banking syndicate group and nortel networks  inc provide for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rates 
we had approximately million outstanding pursuant to our revolving line of credit agreements at december  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material
