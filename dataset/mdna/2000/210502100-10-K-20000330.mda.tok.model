item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the company primarily engage in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts contracts originated by automobile dealers dealers located throughout the united states 
in the past  the company has purchased contracts in as many as different states 
at various times in  the company suspended its solicitation of contract purchases in as many as states  and as of the date of this report is active in states 
there can be no assurance as to resumption of contract purchasing activities in other states 
through its purchase of contracts  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems  who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers captive finance companies 
the company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on residuals as defined below and on contracts held for sale 
during the year ended december   and through the date of this report  the company did not sell any contracts in securitization transactions  and therefore recognized no gains on sale 
all sales of contracts were on a servicing released basis either in the form of bulk sales of contracts being held by the company for sale  or as part of a pass through agreement with a third party for which the company earned a fee on a per contract basis 
the net loss on sale of contracts for the year ended december   was million compared to net gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from interest and servicing fees for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively 
such revenues for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively  and for the year ended december   such revenues were million and million  respectively 
the company s income is affected by losses incurred on contracts  whether such contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations 
the company s cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant should the company sell loans in securitization transactions in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately  compared to net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december  and  of million and million  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company has purchased contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset backed securities 
from late may to the present  the company has purchased contracts on a flow basis for third parties  that is  the company purchases a contract from a dealer  and sells the contract the next day to the third party for the same price the company paid 
the company also receives from the third party a fee for its services 
the company retains no interest in such contracts  and neither services such contracts nor earns a servicing fee 
although the company has not been able to sell contracts in a securitization transaction since december  it does plan to securitize in the future  as to which there can be no assurance 
the company s securitization structure has been as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust the trust 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates  generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the certificates issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior certificates  from an insurance company the certificate insurer 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the certificate insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the servicing agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related certificates 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the certificate insurer and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also been varied by agreement 
the specified levels applicable to the company s sold pools increased materially in effective november   as applied to monthly measurement dates from september onward  the specified levels have decreased  as is discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in the contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account and b the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received by the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the certificates  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the certificates and the residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as held for trading securities 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
for that valuation  the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the certificates  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the servicing agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company  or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their specified levels 
pursuant to certain servicing agreements  excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain certificates to create over collateralization  that is  to reduce the aggregate principal balance of outstanding certificates below the aggregate principal amount of the related automotive receivables 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the servicing agreements 
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company as the owner of the residuals 
the annual percentage rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the rates payable on the certificates 
accordingly  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity  as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
the company has used a constant prepayment estimate of approximately per annum 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will range from to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
in future periods  the company could recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts were to be better than originally estimated  or the company could increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were to be worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying contracts  the company has established a provision for future losses on the residuals 
from march to the present  the company has been unable to complete a securitization transaction  due to unavailability of sufficient capital 
the above description is included because the residuals created in past securitizations continue to represent the company s largest asset  and because the company plans again to purchase contracts for sale in securitization transactions  when necessary pre conditions including availability of capital are fulfilled 
during the year ended december   the company has changed its basic system of doing business 
previously  the company would acquire contracts for its own account  borrowing from to of the principal balance of such contracts under warehouse lines of credit 
periodically approximately once every quarter the company would then sell most or all of the recently acquired contracts in a securitization transaction as described above 
in such a sale  the company would retain a residual ownership interest in the contracts sold  the obligation to service the contracts sold  and the right to receive servicing fees 
at the end of march  the company learned that it would be unable to sell contracts in securitization transactions for an indeterminate period 
accordingly  the company commenced purchasing contracts for immediate re sale to a third party  which third party purchases the contracts in turn on a daily basis 
in this arrangement  the company retains no residual interest in the contracts  has no servicing obligation  and receives no servicing fee 
for its services in acquiring contracts for purchase  the company receives a per contract fee from the third party 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenue decreased million  or  compared to the year ended december  gain on sale of contracts  net  decreased by million  or  from a million gain on sale for the year ended december   to a million loss for the year ended december  the change in gain on sale from positive to negative is due to the company selling contracts only on a servicing released basis and thus not recording any nir gains during the year  as well as to selling contracts at a loss 
during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a servicing released basis  that is  with no residual interest retained  with no servicing obligation  and with no right to receive a servicing fee 
those sales resulted in a net loss of approximately million 
expenses of approximately million were incurred related to previous securitization transactions  including the amortization of a warrant issued to the certificate insurer in november in addition  the company sold million of contracts on a flow through basis and received million of fees which have been included as a component of gain on sale of contracts  net 
for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of provision for losses on contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale 
the increase in the provision for losses on contracts held for sale is primarily due to the company s inability to securitize contracts during as a result  contracts were held for sale for longer periods of time prior to being sold on a servicing released basis  thus requiring additional loss reserves 
interest income decreased by million  or  representing of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to decreases in contracts held for sale and nirs during beginning in may  the company began to purchase contracts on a flow through basis and thus did not hold any additional contracts for sale since that time 
additionally  the company completed the final sale of contracts on a servicing released basis  other than those sold on a flow through basis  on september   leaving approximately million of contracts held for sale at the end of september and decreasing to million by year end 
such a reduction in contract purchases is expected to cause a reduction in revenues both interest and gain on sale in future periods 
servicing fees increased by million  or  and represented of total revenue 
servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the increase in servicing fees is primarily due to an increase in the fees other than base fees collected during during the year ended december   the company collected million of other servicing fees  an increase of over other servicing fees collected in the prior year

during the year ended december   the company purchased  million in contracts from dealers  compared to million in the year ended december  the company expects that contract purchases in the near future will not exceed million per quarter 
such a reduction in contract purchases is expected to cause a reduction in revenues both interest and gain on sale in future periods 
servicing fees increased by million  or  and represented of total revenue 
the increase in servicing fees is due to the increase in contract purchase  sale and servicing activities 
as of december   the company was earning servicing fees on  contracts approximating  million  compared to  contracts approximating million as of december  in addition to the  million in sold contracts on which servicing fees were earned  the company was holding for sale and servicing an additional million in contracts for an aggregate servicing portfolio of  million

the company s effective tax rate was for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash from operating activities have been proceeds from the sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under its various warehouse lines  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold  proceeds from the sales of contracts  customer payments of principal and interest on contracts held for sale  fees for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from spread accounts 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under its warehouse lines and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  and occupancy expenses  the establishment of and further contributions to spread accounts  and income taxes 
as a result  the company has been dependent on its warehouse lines of credit to purchase contracts  and on the availability of capital from outside sources in order to finance its continued operations  and to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not borrowed under warehouse lines of credit 
the company is not presently party to any warehouse line of credit  and did not receive any material releases of cash from spread accounts from june through october the inability to borrow and the lack of cash releases resulted in a liquidity deficiency  which has been progressively alleviated since the recommencement of releases of cash from spread accounts began in november the company has maintained its contract purchasing program in the absence of any warehouse line of credit by entering into flow purchase arrangements 
flow purchases allow the company to purchase contracts while maintaining only an immaterial level of contracts held for sale 
the company s revenues from flow purchase of contracts  however  are materially less than may be received by holding contracts to maturity or by selling contracts in securitization transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities was  during the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash released from trusts was million  compared to net cash deposited into trusts of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company did not complete a securitization transaction  and therefore  did not use any cash for initial deposits to spread accounts  compared to million used during the year ended december  cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  from cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts in the year ended december  cash released from spread accounts for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  from cash released from spread accounts in the year ended december  changes in deposits to and releases from spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold contracts that make up the company s servicing portfolio 
beginning in june  the company s liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from spread accounts 
such releases did not occur because a number of the trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective servicing agreements 
accordingly  pursuant to the servicing agreements  the specified levels applicable to the company s spread accounts were increased  in most cases to an unlimited amount 
due to cross collateralization provisions of the servicing agreements  the specified levels have been increased on of the company s remaining trusts 
until the november effectiveness of an amendment to the servicing agreement  described below  no material releases from any of the spread accounts were available to the company 
upon effectiveness of that amendment  the requisite spread account levels in general have been set at of the outstanding principal balance of the certificates issued by the related trusts  with higher percentages applicable to those trusts that have amortized to the point that floor or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable 
in addition to requiring higher spread account levels  the servicing agreements provide the certificate insurer with certain other rights and remedies  some of which have been waived on a monthly basis by the certificate insurer with respect to all of the trusts 
increased specified levels for the spread accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past 
as a result of the increased spread account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions  excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the company instead were retained in the spread accounts to bring the balance of those spread accounts up to higher levels 
as a result of the increased specified levels applicable to the spread accounts  approximately million of cash that would otherwise have been available to the company had been delayed and retained in the spread accounts as of december  a portion of such cash was subsequently released to the company  as discussed below 
since late may  the company has purchased contracts from dealers without use of warehouse lines of credit  in flow purchase arrangements with third parties 
under the flow purchase arrangements  the company purchases contracts from dealers and sells such contracts outright to the third party 
purchase of contracts on a flow basis  as compared with purchase of contracts for the company s own account  has materially reduced the company s cash requirements 
the company s plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to increase the quantity of contracts that it purchases and sells on a flow basis  thus increasing the fees that it receives in connection with such purchases and sales  and to continue to receive releases of cash from its spread accounts  pursuant to the amendment  which became effective on november  there can be no assurance that this plan will be successful 
during the second and third quarters of  the company sold  on a servicing released basis  million of its contracts held for sale 
the remaining contracts held for sale represent contracts that did not meet the criteria for the various sales occurring in the second and third quarters 
the company s ability to increase the quantity of contracts that it purchases and sells on a flow basis will be subject to general competitive conditions and other factors 
although the company has continued to increase the amount of contracts purchased and sold on a flow basis  there can be no assurance that the current level of flow production can be maintained or increased 
obtaining releases of cash from the spread accounts is dependent on collections from the related trusts generating sufficient cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
capital resources the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than flow purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
in the past  the company funded the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions  as discussed above  and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity 
during the year ended december   the company did not complete a securitization transaction  issued million of subordinated debt  sold million of contracts on a servicing released basis  and received million in loans from affiliated parties

see business purchase and sale of contracts securitization and sale of contracts to institutional investors 
commencing with the securitization completed on june   asset backed securities with aaa aaa or p a ratings have been sold through public offerings pursuant to registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
these trusts are structured as owner trusts rather than as grantor trusts 
commencing with the securitization completed on july   the company began using a structure that included a guaranteed money market tranche of asset backed securities  rated p a 
as noted above  the absence of any significant releases of cash from spread accounts since june had materially impaired the company s ability to meet such capital requirements 
to reduce its capital requirements and to meet those requirements  the company in november began to implement a three part plan the plan includes i issuance of debt and equity securities  ii agreements with the certificate insurer to reduce the level of initial spread account deposits  and to reduce the maximum levels of the spread accounts  and iii a reduction in the rate of contract purchases 
as the first step in the plan  the company in november and april issued million and million  respectively  of subordinated promissory notes collectively  the llcp notes  to levine leichtman capital partners  lp llcp 
the llcp notes are due in  and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
net proceeds received from the issuances were approximately million 
in conjunction with the llcp notes  the company issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share   and  of which were exercised in april and may  respectively 
the effective cost of this new capital represents a material increase in the cost of capital to the company 
as part of the agreements for issuance of the llcp notes  stanwich financial services corp 
sfsc agreed to purchase an additional million of notes at least million by july   and the remainder by august   and the company agreed to sell such notes 
the chairman and the president of the company are the principal shareholders of sfsc  and the company s chairman is the chief executive officer of sfsc 
the terms of these transactions were subsequently modified  in march  as discussed below 
also in november  as the second step in its plan  the company reached an agreement with the certificate insurer regarding initial cash deposits 
in this agreement  the certificate insurer committed to insure asset backed securities issued by the trusts with respect to at least million of contracts  while requiring an initial cash deposit of of principal 
of the million committed  million was used in the company s december securitization transaction 
the company s agreement with the certificate insurer also required that the company issue to the certificate insurer or its designee warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share  exercisable through the fifth anniversary of the warrants issuance 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the amendment agreement mentioned above the amendment fixes the amount of cash to be retained in the spread accounts for of the company s remaining securitization trusts 
the amended level is of the outstanding principal balance of the certificates issued by such trusts  computed on a pool by pool basis 
the level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization 
older trusts may require more than if the certificate balance has amortized to such a level that floor or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable 
in the event of certain defaults by the company  the specified level applicable to such spread accounts could increase to an unlimited amount  but such defaults are narrowly defined  and the company does not anticipate suffering such defaults 
the amendment by its terms is applicable from september onward  and on november   the necessary signatures and conditions were satisfied to make the amendment effective 
the company on november   received its first material release of cash from the securitized portfolio pursuant to the terms of the amendment 
the releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month 
there can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future 
as a third part of its plan  the company reduced its planned level of contract purchases initially to not more than million per quarter beginning november in the first quarter of  the company purchased million of contracts 
during the second quarter of  the company purchased million of contracts  of which million was on a flow basis  as discussed below 
during the third quarter of  the company purchased million of contracts  all of which was on a flow basis 
during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased million of contracts  all of which was on a flow basis 
the company expects to purchase contracts only on a flow basis in the future until the company is able to identify appropriate sources of capital to acquire and hold contracts for the company s own account 
the reduction in the amount of contracts purchased for the company s own account has materially reduced the company s capital requirements 
over the three year period ended december   the company has increased its capitalization by issuing million of senior debt  an aggregate of million of subordinated debt which is convertible into  or was issued with warrants to purchase  common stock  million of related party debt million of which is partially convertible and million which is entirely convertible and million of capital stock 
the following review of the terms of such issuances shows that the cost of such capital increased materially beginning in in april the company issued  in a public offering  million of subordinated partially convertible notes due  which bear an interest rate of per annum 
these notes are convertible as to of their principal amount into common stock of cps at per share 
in june the company issued to a related party million of partially convertible notes due these notes are convertible as to of their principal amount into common stock of cps at per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s funding strategy is largely dependent upon issuing interest bearing asset backed securities and incurring debt 
therefore  fluctuations in interest rates affect the company s profitability 
the company uses several strategies to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations  including offering only fixed rate contracts to obligors  regular sales of auto contracts to the trusts  and pre funding securitizations  whereby the amount of asset backed securities issued in a securitization exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the loans it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding
