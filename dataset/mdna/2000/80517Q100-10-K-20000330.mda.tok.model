see note c and e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of the company s operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the dollar 
the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index was approximately in  in and in  while the shekel was devalued by approximately  and  respectively 
as a result  for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in and in in corresponding decreases in these costs in us dollars 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
at december   intangibles  net  consist mainly of  net of amortization relating to the purchase of all rights to hgh previously licensed to the du pont merck pharmaceutical company  together with all rights to all data generated in pharmacological  toxicological and clinical studies and encompassed in the ind and nda files then pending with the fda for the treatment of human growth hormone deficient children 
the company believes that its remaining cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  scheduled payments to be made to btg under its current agreements with pharmaceutical partners and third parties and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of the company s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of the company s products  the company s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and the company s ability to obtain additional equity investments  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
the company continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements  in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements 
see item business risk factors capital needs and variability of operating results 
the year problem the year problem or year was to have resulted from computer programs and devices that did not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations potentially would not properly recognize the year this could have resulted in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of the company s operations  including  without limitation  manufacturing  distribution  clinical development  research and other business activities 
the year problem potentially affected substantially all of btg s business activities 
the company believes that as a result of its year remediation and planning programs  the year problem has not  as of march   had a material adverse effect on the operations or financial results of the company 
as of december   the company estimates that it had incurred approximately  in its year efforts  including without limitation  outside consulting fees and computer systems upgrades  but excluding internal staff costs  all of which has been expensed 
it is possible that btg will experience year related problems in the future  particularly with its non business critical systems  which may result in failures or miscalculations resulting in inaccuracies in computer output or disruptions of operations 
however  btg believes that the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for its business critical computer systems and equipment 
the financial impact of future remediation activities that may become necessary  if any  cannot be known precisely at this time  but it is not expected to be material
