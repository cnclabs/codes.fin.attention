the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease is a result of markdowns taken during the period to avoid perpetuating the company s merchandise issues related to lower than expected sales of fall and holiday merchandise 
in addition  higher occupancy costs that did not leverage due to lower sales negatively impacted the gross margin 
the company s gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin can be primarily attributed to improved inventory planning and customer acceptance of product offerings  resulting in lower inventory levels and reduced markdowns 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by of sales in fiscal compared to a decrease of of sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal was primarily due to new store opening costs and the inability to leverage non occupancy fixed costs due to the comparable store sales decline 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal was primarily due to reduced advertising and catalog production costs  offset by increased payroll related expenses 
in fiscal  the company initiated a reduction in the total number of catalogs circulated to reduce costs  while attempting to minimize the reduction in sales 
the result was a  or  decline in production costs and an  or  decline in catalog sales 
during fiscal  the total interest costs increased  compared to fiscal due to higher outstanding debt balances 
the average balance on total outstanding debt was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the increase in average debt balances resulted principally from new store construction  lower sales than expected and higher inventory levels

impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  with an effective date for periods beginning after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

adoption of sfas no

establishes standards for accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company will adopt this new standard effective february   and management believes the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the year issue the year issue the inability for certain computer systems to recognize as the year instead of the year was a source of much concern for many companies including harold s stores  inc if this issue had not been addressed  it could have resulted in serious business interruptions for the company 
in anticipation of this event  the company expended a great deal of energy preparing its systems to ensure that its computer systems would be compliant and that the risk of system failure would be eliminated or mitigated to the extent possible 
the company s diligence was rewarded because the year issue was a non event 
the company s year compliance project included four phases evaluation of the company s owned or leased systems and equipment to identify potential year compliance issues  remediation or replacement of company systems and equipment determined to be non compliant and testing of remediated systems before returning them to production  inquiry regarding year readiness of material business partners and other third parties on whom the company s business is dependent  and development of contingency plans  where feasible  to address potential third party non compliance or failure of material company systems 
the initial phase of the company s year compliance project was the evaluation of all software  hardware and equipment owned  leased or licensed by the company  and identification of those systems and equipment requiring year remediation 
this analysis was completed during fiscal all computer hardware in the company s corporate office  distribution center and retail stores that was not year compliant was remediated or replaced by the end of the calendar year 
of those software systems that were found not to be year compliant  all material systems were remediated or replaced by year compliant software 
over the past few years  the company s strategic plan has included significant investment in and modernization of many of the company s computer systems 
as a result  much of the costs and timing for replacement of certain of the company s systems that were not year compliant were already anticipated as part of the company s planned information systems spending and did not need to be accelerated as a result of the company s year project 
the total cost to the company specifically associated with addressing the year issue was approximately million 
this approximately million of costs principally related to the purchase of new capitalizable software and hardware investments 
the company communicated with its business partners  including key manufacturers  vendors  banks and other third parties with whom it does business  to obtain information regarding their state of readiness with respect to the year issue 
the company did not experience any business interruptions from any of its business partners related to the year compliance issue 
the company s year compliance project also included development of a contingency plan designed to support critical business operations in the event of the occurrence of systems failures or the occurrence of reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
it was not necessary for the company to employ any of its contingency plans as no system failures or other unexpected events occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at january   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates which averaged approximately during fiscal year a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at january  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at january   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during fiscal years  and
