item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this filing  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to tsi software are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this document 
overview tsi international software ltd 
was incorporated in connecticut in and reincorporated in delaware in september historically  tsi software has derived a majority of revenues from products other than mercator  primarily our trading partner family of products and the key master product 
however  revenue related to the mercator family of products has grown significantly in each of the last three years and has increased as a percentage of total revenues 
tsi software believes that future growth in revenues  if any  will be mainly attributed to the mercator suite of products 
tsi software believes it cannot accurately predict the amount of revenues that will be attributable to this product line or the life of such products 
to the extent our mercator products do not maintain continued market acceptance  the business will be adversely affected 
tsi software revenues are derived principally from two sources i license fees for the use tsi software s products and ii service fees for maintenance  consulting services and training related to software products 
tsi software generally recognizes revenue from software license fees upon delivery  unless there are significant post delivery obligations  in which case  revenues are recognized when these obligations are satisfied 
this is the case with certain customers who have purchased a financial services solution whereby tsi software recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method as services are performed 
the key master product is licensed under term use contracts rather than for a one time license fee  and tsi software recognizes revenue from these arrangements on a present value basis at the inception of the contract 
tsi software does not actively market new term use contracts for key master but continues to receive maintenance revenues 
as a result  maintenance revenue accounts for a larger proportion of key master revenue and increases the percentage of tsi softwares total revenues represented by services  maintenance and other revenues 
tsi software intends to continue to increase the scope of service offerings insofar as it supports the sale of license revenues from sales of tsi software products 
we believe that software licensing revenue will continue to account for a larger portion of total revenues than service  maintenance and other revenues 
mercator can be used by information technology professionals as well as value added resellers  independent software vendors  software integrators or other third parties who resell  embed or otherwise bundle mercator with their products 
license fee revenues are derived from direct sales of software products through our direct sales force and indirect third parties 
sales through distributors and resellers represented approximately of domestic license revenue in international revenue accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   for and of total revenues in the increase is primarily attributed to the purchase of braid in march of  and the addition of a sales office in frankfurt  germany 
the size of orders can range from a few thousand dollars to over  per order 
the loss or delay of large individual orders  therefore  can have a significant impact on revenue and other quarterly results 
in addition  tsi software generally recognizes a substantial portion of its quarterly software licensing revenues in the last month of each quarter  and as a result  revenue for any particular quarter may be difficult to predict in advance 
because operating expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in significant losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by increased revenue  operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors operating results for any quarter are subject to variation  and period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items from our statements of operations years ended december  revenues software licensing service  maintenance and other total revenue cost of revenues software licensing service  maintenance and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before taxes income taxes expense benefit net income loss gross profit software licensing service  maintenance and other year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased from million in to million in software licensing 
total software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in domestic software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily due to an increase in mercator license revenues as a result of a larger customer base 
international software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of the braid acquisition and the larger salesperson base available to sell our mercator products 
international licensing revenues from braid products and mercator products were million and million  respectively 
service  maintenance and other 
service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in domestic service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was a result of increased service demands from our mercator customers and the related acquisition of services personnel to address those needs  as well as additional maintenance revenues on the mercator license sales 
international service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributed to the larger service component of the traditional braid financial services product as well as increased services on our mercator product sales 
service  maintenance and other revenues from braid products and mercator products sold internationally were million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of software licensing revenues consists primarily of cd roms  manuals  distribution costs and the cost of third party software that tsi software resells 
cost of service  maintenance and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing maintenance  technical support  consulting  and training to customers 
gross margin on software licensing revenues is higher than gross margin on service  maintenance and other revenues  reflecting the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing maintenance  technical support  consulting and training services 
cost of service  maintenance and other revenues also varies based upon the mix of maintenance  technical support  training and professional consulting services 
cost of software licensing 
total cost of software licensing revenues decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in costs of distribution 
in  the majority of products were sold on a single cd rom  which includes all documentation and other materials  thereby reducing the costs of packaging and materials as well as shipping charges 
software licensing gross margin increased to for over in  due to the volume of sales and low cost of software distribution 
cost of software licensing revenues for domestic operations decreased to  in from million in and gross margin on software licensing domestic increased to in from in as a result of the low cost of distribution and the resulting economies of scale on the larger number of transactions 
the cost of software licensing from international operations was  in this cost was due to the purchase of braid in march of and the increase in international sales of braid s traditional financial services products as well as the increased sales of tsi software s mercator products 
costs for international sales for were minimal 
gross margin on software licensing international was for total cost of service  maintenance and other 
cost of service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in gross margin on total costs of service  maintenance and other were and  respectively 
this decrease is due to the increase in the lower margin professional services offerings for cost of service  maintenance and other for domestic operations increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the increase in services performed for mercator customers along with costs of training services purchased by our increased customer base 
gross margin on service  maintenance and other  domestic was in and in gross margin for the professional service component was 
the difference is related to lower margins on professional services than on maintenance services 
cost of service  maintenance and other for international operations increased to million in from a minimal cost in this increase was the result of the acquisition of braid and related services personnel 
in addition  braid s traditional financial services products have a larger professional services component than tsi software s mercator product suite 
accordingly  international gross margin in was for professional services  as compared to domestic gross margin of 
gross margins on service  maintenance and other for international operations was for operating expenses product development 
product development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting  and other personnel related costs  depreciation of development equipment  supplies  travel and allocated facilities and communication costs 
product development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased headcount associated with the development of new mercator based products and the acquisition of braid in march and novera in september product development expenses represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
international product development expenses were million in there was no development performed internationally in tsi software believes that a significant level of research and development expenditures is required to remain competitive 
accordingly  tsi software anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
tsi software expects that the dollar amount of research and development expenses will continue to increase  particularly in the us to date  all research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist of sales and marketing personnel costs  including sales commissions  recruiting  travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  trade shows  product descriptive literature  and allocated facilities and communications costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increased number of sales and marketing personnel hired to pursue mercator marketing opportunities and programs 
selling and marketing expenses represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
during  the acquisition of braid resulted in an increase in headcount of salespeople 
these individuals sold both the traditional braid financial services products as well as the mercator product line 
selling and marketing costs for international operations were million in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting  and other personnel related expenses for tsi software s administrative  executive  and finance personnel as well as outside legal  tax services  and audit fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to increased number of employees  the cost of management information system staff  as well as increased depreciation expenses for related equipment and software 
the acquisition of braid in march of and the establishment of a german sales office increased both headcount and expense in the administrative area 
international administrative costs were million for general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
tsi software believes that the dollar amount of its general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as tsi software continues to expand its administrative staff and incurs additional costs to enhance its systems and administrative processes 
amortization of intangibles 
intangible assets are comprised of the excess of the purchase price and related costs of an acquired business over the value assigned to tangible assets 
the acquisitions made by tsi software were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase prices were allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values with any excess designated as goodwill 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to five years 
amortization expense increased from  in to  in as a result of the acquisitions of braid in march and novera in september the amortization expense in consisted of two months of amortization relating to the acquisition of scp 
as a result of these acquisitions  as of december  and  tsi software had net intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
other income expense  net interest income decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to the use of cash in the acquisitions of braid and novera during borrowing expenses decreased from  in to in due to the expiration of tsi software s line of credit 
tsi software had no other outstanding debt obligations during taxes at december   tsi software had million of non deductible expenses  primarily amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
tsi software also had deferred tax assets of million 
tsi software has concluded that it is more likely than not that tsi software will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets  accordingly  tsi software reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes 
this resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit for the year ending december  at december   tsi software had concluded that it was more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards would be utilized  accordingly  tsi software reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes  which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit for the year ending december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased from million in to million in software licensing 
total software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in domestic software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in international software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in these increases were primarily due to a increase in mercator license revenue to million in from million in  partially offset by decreases in licenses of tsi software s key master product 
service  maintenance and other 
total service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in domestic service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in international service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in these increases were primarily due to a increase in professional service revenues to million in from million in  most of this was a result of professional services associated with mercator 
to a lesser extent  these increases were also due to an increase in mercator maintenance revenues  offset by a slight decrease in maintenance revenues related to tsi software s key master products 
maintenance revenues attributable to key master were million and million for and  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of software licensing 
cost of software licensing revenues increased from  in to  in this increase was due to an increase in product sales of mercator 
software licensing gross margin remained constant at in and cost of service  maintenance and other 
cost of service  maintenance and other revenues increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of support personnel related to tsi software s mercator product and the november acquisition of scp service personnel 
operating expenses product development 
product development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased number of employees associated with the development of new mercator based products 
product development expenses represented and of total revenues for and  respectively selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increased number of sales and marketing personnel required to address mercator marketing opportunities and increased spending on mercator related marketing programs 
selling and marketing expenses represented of total revenues for both and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and the cost of management information system staff and increased depreciation expenses for related equipment and software 
general administrative expenses remained constant at of total revenues for and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense increased from in to  in as a result of the acquisition of scp in november amortization expense in consisted of two months of amortization of scp intangible assets 
as of december   tsi software had net intangible assets of million 
other income expense  net interest income increased from  in to  in due to the investment income earned on proceeds from tsi software s initial and secondary public offerings 
borrowing expenses decreased from  in to  in due to the repayment of tsi software s bank debt with the proceeds from its initial public offering 
taxes at december   tsi software had concluded that it was more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards would be utilized  accordingly  tsi software reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit for the year ending december  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  the provision for income taxes for was not significant 
liquidity and capital resources on december   tsi software had net working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
working capital at december  was million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
in  cash used by operations was million compared to cash provided of million in net accounts receivable were million at december  compared to million at december  the number of days of average revenues in accounts receivable was at december  compared to at december  the increase in accounts receivable is due to the large percentage of sales billed during the last month of the quarter as compared to  the increase in deferred revenue and the granting of extended terms for certain customers 
in response to the increase in days sales outstanding  tsi software has dedicated additional resources to the collection of outstanding receivables 
capital expenditures have been  and future capital expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for facilities  equipment and computer software to support expansion of the companies operations 
additions to property plant and equipment accounted for million and million of expenditures for and  respectively 
as of december   tsi software had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
tsi software believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances  and future cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion for a least a six month period 
thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy tsi software s operating requirements  tsi software may seek additional debt or equity financing 
as of march  tsi software established a three year million dollar line of credit with fleet bank 
the sale of additional equity could result in dilution to tsi software s stockholders 
in addition  in an effort to best utilize its working capital  tsi software intends to pursue the development and acquisition of additional products or businesses  which support the current business needs 
tsi software has no agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions 
year disclosure tsi software was aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems 
tsi software s business is dependent on both the operation of its software it sells to customers  its internal systems and the buying patterns and state of it systems of its customer base 
in preparation for the year  tsi software tested all of its products  evaluated and updated all of its internal systems and communicated the status of product and upgrade requirements to its customers 
tsi software did not encounter any problems in regard to its products or internal systems at january   or february  in addition  tsi software s business did not appear to be impacted by its customers purchasing patterns as of december   either in regards to purchase or return activity 
the total cost of year compliance activities was not material to tsi software s results of operations and financial condition  and was handled by individuals responsible for the specific areas in the ordinary course of business 
there were no accruals made in for loss contingencies relating to year conversion to a single european currency tsi software has sales in a number of foreign countries 
however  as the majority of foreign sales are in the uk  conversion to a single european currency would not have a material impact on tsi software s financial results 
factors that may affect future results our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
we believe that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our results of operations as they are not necessarily indications of our future performance 
in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectation of public market analysts and investors 
in this case  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast and depend on a variety of factors 
these factors include the following 
the size  timing and terms of individual license transactions  
the sales cycle for our products  
demand for and market acceptance of our products and related services  particularly our mercator products  
our ability to expand  and market acceptance of  our professional services business  
the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of product releases or increased revenue  
the timing of product enhancements and product introductions by us and our competitors  
market acceptance of enhanced versions of our existing products and of new products  
changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  
variations in the mix of products and services sold by us  
the mix of channels through which our products and services are sold  
our success in penetrating international markets  
the buying patterns and budgeting cycles of customers  
personnel changes  our ability to attract and retain qualified sales  professional services and research and development personnel and the rate at which this personnel becomes productive  and 
general economic conditions 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenues from the licensing of our software products  and we anticipate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
software license revenues are difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including the following 
we typically do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter substantially depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter  
the length of the sales cycles for our products can vary significantly from customer to customer and from product to product and can be as long as nine months or more  
the terms and conditions of individual license transactions  including prices and discounts  are often negotiated based on volumes and commitments  and may vary considerably from customer to customer  
we have generally recognized a substantial portion of our quarterly software licensing revenues in the last month of each quarter 
accordingly  the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of purchases of our products could harm our business 
it would be difficult for us to adjust our spending if we experience any revenue shortfalls our future revenues will also be difficult to predict and we could fail to achieve our revenue expectations 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectation of future revenues  and expense levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason  our operating results are likely to be harmed 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because a large portion of our expenses are related to headcount that cannot be easily reduced without harming our business 
in addition  we currently intend to increase our operating expenses by expanding our research and product development staff  particularly research and development personnel to be devoted to our mercator product line  increasing our sales and marketing and professional services operations  expanding distribution channels  and hiring personnel in other operating areas 
we expect to experience a significant time lag between the date professional services  sales  and technical personnel are hired and the date these employees become fully productive 
the timing of expansion and the rate at which new technical  professional services  and sales personnel become productive as well as the timing of the introduction and success of new distribution channels could cause material fluctuations in our results of operations 
furthermore  to the extent increased operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our business could be harmed 
we may experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues or results of operations while we have not historically experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in our revenues or results of operations  it is not uncommon for software companies to experience strong fourth quarters followed by weaker first quarters  in some cases with sequential declines in revenues or operating profit 
we believe that many software companies exhibit this pattern in their sales cycles primarily due to customers buying patterns and budget cycles 
we may display this pattern in future years 
we depend on the sales of our mercator products and related services we introduced our mercator products in in recent years  a significant portion of our revenue has been attributable to licenses of our mercator products and related services  and we expect that revenue attributable to our mercator products and related services will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our future operating results significantly depend on the market acceptance and growth of our mercator product line and enhancements of these products and services 
market acceptance of our mercator product line may not increase or remain at current levels  and we may not be able to successfully market our mercator product line or develop extensions and enhancements to this product line on a long term basis 
in the event that our current or future competitors release new products that provide  or are perceived as providing  more advanced features  greater functionality  better performance  better compatibility with other systems or lower prices than our mercator product line  demand for our products and services would likely decline 
a decline in demand for  or market acceptance of  our mercator product line would harm our business 
we may experience difficulties in developing and introducing new or enhanced products necessitated by technological changes our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate changes  to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our products may be rendered obsolete if we fail to anticipate or react to change 
development of enhancements to existing products and new products depends  in part  on a number of factors  including the following 
the timing of releases of new versions of applications systems by vendors  
the introduction of new applications  systems or computing platforms  
the timing of changes in platforms  
the release of new standards or changes to existing standards  and 
changing customer requirements 
our product enhancements or new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
in addition  our introduction or announcement  or by one or more of our current or future competitors  of products embodying new technologies or features could render our existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
our introduction or announcement of enhanced or new product offerings or by our current or future competitors may cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of our existing products 
any deferment or cancellation of purchases could harm our business 
we could experience delays in developing and releasing new products or product enhancements we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of product enhancements and new products and we may experience delays in the future 
furthermore  as the number of applications  systems and platforms supported by our products increases  we could experience difficulties in developing  on a timely basis  product enhancements which address the increased number of new versions of applications  systems or platforms served by our existing products 
if we fail  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce product enhancements or new products in a timely and cost effective manner or if we experience any significant delay in product development or introduction  our customers may delay or decide against purchases of our products  which could harm our business 
the success of our products will also depend upon the success of the platforms we target we may  in the future  seek to develop and market enhancements to existing products or new products which are targeted for applications  systems or platforms which we believe will achieve commercial acceptance 
this could require us to devote significant development  sales and marketing personnel  as well as other resources  to these efforts  which would otherwise be available for other purposes 
we may not be able to successfully identify these applications  systems or platforms  and even if we do so  they may not achieve commercial acceptance or we may not realize a sufficient return on our investment 
failure of these targeted applications  systems or platforms to achieve commercial acceptance or our failure to achieve a sufficient return on our investment could harm our business 
we may not successfully expand our sales and distribution channels an integral part of our strategy is to expand our indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors 
this channel is accounting for a growing percentage of our total revenues and we are increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding these indirect distribution channels 
we may not be successful in expanding the number of indirect distribution channels for our products 
if we are successful in increasing our sales through indirect sales channels  we expect that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels  and revenue we receive for each sale will be less than if we had licensed the same product to the customer directly 
selling through indirect channels may also limit our contact with our customers 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
even if we successfully expand our indirect distribution channels  any new value added resellers  independent software vendors  system integrators or distributors may offer competing products  or have no minimum purchase requirements of our products 
these third parties may also not have the technical expertise required to market and support our products successfully 
if the third parties do not provide adequate levels of services and technical support  our customers could become dissatisfied  or we would have to devote additional resources for customer support 
our brand name and reputation could be harmed 
selling products through indirect sales channels could cause conflicts with the selling efforts of our direct sales force 
our strategy of marketing products directly to end users and indirectly through value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
although we have attempted to manage our distribution channels to avoid potential conflicts  channel conflicts may harm our relationships with existing value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators or distributors or impair our ability to attract new value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors 
our future success depends on retaining our key personnel and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified employees our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key sales  professional services and research and development personnel  as well as senior management 
all employees are employed at will and we have no fixed term employment agreements with our employees  which prevents them from terminating their employment at any time 
the loss of the services of any of one or more of our key employees could harm our business 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly qualified sales  research and development  professional services and managerial personnel  particularly sales  professional services and research and development personnel with expertise in enterprise resource planning systems 
competition for these personnel is intense 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel 
we have at times experienced  and we continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and research and development personnel  and we anticipate these difficulties will continue in the future 
furthermore  we have in the past experienced  and in the future we expect to continue to experience  a significant time lag between the date sales  research and development and professional services personnel are hired and the date these employees become fully productive 
we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth our business has grown in recent periods  with total revenues increasing from approximately million in to million in we have also acquired the assets of software consulting partners in november  braid in march  and novera software  inc in september the growth of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on our administrative  financial  sales and operational resources and increased demands on our systems and controls 
for example  we noted an increase in quarterly days sales outstanding from december  to december  from approximately days to approximately days  and an increase in net accounts receivable from million to million 
to deal with these concerns  we have recently implemented  or are in the process of implementing and will be required to implement in the future  a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
in addition  we intend to hire additional administrative personnel 
we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation and integration of these systems  procedures and controls  or hire additional personnel  in a timely manner 
the failure of our management to respond to  and manage  our growth and changing business conditions  or to adapt our operational  management and financial control systems to accommodate our growth could harm our business 
we may face significant risks in expanding our international operations international revenues accounted for of our total revenues for however  as a result of the acquisitions of braid  and the establishment of a sales office in germany during  international revenues accounted for of our total revenues for continued expansion of our international sales and marketing efforts will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we also expect to commit additional time and development resources to customizing our products for selected international markets and to developing international sales and support channels 
international operations involve a number of additional risks  including the following 
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  
longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
dependence on independent resellers  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  tariffs and other trade barriers  
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  
potentially adverse tax consequences  and 
political and economic instability 
to the extent that our international operations expand  we expect that an increasing portion of our international license and service and other revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or similar hedging strategies 
the currency exchange strategy that we adopt may not be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  the above listed factors may cause a decline in our future international revenue and  consequently  may harm our business 
we may not be able to sustain or increase revenue that we derive from international sources 
our success depends upon the widespread use and adoption of the internet and intranets we believe that demand for enterprise application integration solutions  such as those that we offer  will depend  in part  upon the adoption by businesses and end users of the internet and intranets as platforms for electronic commerce and communications 
the internet and intranets are new and evolving  and they may not be widely adopted  particularly for electronic commerce and communications among businesses 
critical issues concerning the internet and intranets  including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access and quality of service  remain unresolved at this time  inhibiting adoption by many enterprises and end users 
if the internet and intranets are not widely used by businesses and end users  particularly for electronic commerce  this could harm our business 
government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
congress has recently passed legislation and several more bills have recently been sponsored in both the house and senate that are designed to regulate certain aspects of the internet  including on line content  copyright infringement  user privacy  taxation  access charges  liability for third party activities and jurisdiction 
in addition  federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the internet 
areas of potential regulation include libel  pricing  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership 
the laws governing the use of the internet  in general  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad 
this occurrence may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online by limiting how information can flow over the internet and the type of information that can flow over the internet 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
it is not known how courts will interpret both existing and new laws 
therefore  we are uncertain as to how new laws or the application of existing laws will affect our business 
in addition  our business may be indirectly affected by our clients who may be subject to such legislation 
increased regulation of the internet may decrease the growth in the use of the internet  which could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
capacity constraints caused by growth in the use of the internet may  unless resolved  impede further development of the internet to the extent that users experience delays  transmission errors and other difficulties 
further  the adoption of the internet for commerce and communications  particularly by those individuals and companies that have historically relied upon alternative means of commerce and communication generally requires the understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
in particular  companies that have already invested substantial resources in other means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new internet based strategy that may make their existing personnel and infrastructure obsolete 
if the necessary infrastructure  products  services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial medium  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the us omnibus appropriations act of places a moratorium on taxes levied on internet access from october  to october  however  states may place taxes on internet access if taxes had already been generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october  states which can show they enforced internet access taxes prior to october  and states after october  may be able to levy taxes on internet access resulting in increased cost to access to the internet  resulting in a material adverse effect on our business 
we face significant competition in the market for e business integration software the market for our products and services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid change 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
in the e business integration market  our mercator products and related services compete primarily against solutions developed internally by individual businesses to meet their specific e business integration needs 
in addition  we face increasing competition in the e business integration market from other third party software vendors 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends or customer requirements  or devote greater resources than we do to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets against these competitors 
we expect that we will face increasing pricing pressures from our current competitors and new market entrants 
our competitors may engage in pricing practices that reduce the average selling prices of our products and related services 
to offset declining average selling prices  we believe that we must successfully introduce and sell enhancements to existing products and new products on a timely basis 
we must also develop enhancements to existing products and new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
to the extent that enhancements to existing products and new products are not developed in a timely manner  do not achieve customer acceptance or do not generate higher average selling prices  our operating margins may decline 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary technology our success is dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we do not currently have any patents and we rely principally on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our technology 
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  product enhancements and new product developments are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we enter into confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  distributors and customers  and we limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
the steps that we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology  and these protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
third parties could also independently develop competing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
furthermore  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited outside of the united states 
any failure by or inability of us to protect our proprietary technology could harm our business 
we may become subject to infringement claims although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties might assert infringement claims against us or our customers in the future 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation  either as plaintiff or defendant  would cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources from productive tasks 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  could harm our business 
furthermore  parties making claims against us could secure substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to license our products in the united states or abroad 
a large monetary judgment could harm our business
