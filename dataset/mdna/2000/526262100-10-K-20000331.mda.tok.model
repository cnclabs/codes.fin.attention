seasonality historically  principally due to the timing of wholesale trade shows early in the calendar year and the limited supply of the company s products  the company has received the majority of its total annual customer orders during the first quarter of each year 
the company entered of its total annual customer orders for both and  during the first quarter of each of those years 
cancellations of total annual customer orders were approximately and in and  respectively

orders not shipped in a particular year  net of cancellations  are carried into backlog for the following year and have historically been orders for spring and easter products 
the company s backlog was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company receives products  pays its suppliers and ships products throughout the year  although historically the majority of shipments occur in the second and third quarters as retailers stock merchandise in anticipation of the holiday season 
as a result of this seasonal pattern  the company generally records its highest sales during the second and third quarters of each year 
the company expects this seasonal pattern to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly sales growth and related net income compared with the prior year due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by customers 
the company is not managed to maximize quarter to quarter results  but rather to achieve broader  long term annual growth consistent with the company s business strategy

foreign exchange the dollar value of the company s assets abroad is not significant

the company intends to manage foreign exchange risks to the extent possible and take appropriate action where warranted 
the company s costs could be adversely affected if the currencies of the countries in which the manufacturers operate appreciate significantly relative to the us dollar 
effect of inflation the company continually attempts to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling its operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
recent developments on february   the company issued a press release stating in relevant part we continue to see this year as a rebuilding year with our dealers dealer orders through february were down approximately against the comparable period in the prior year 
year to date village orders were approximately behind the comparable period in the prior year  while general giftware orders were down approximately 
the company stated that excluding the impact of the special one time customer appreciation discount that it has offered on early orders for most product categories  as announced in december  dealer orders would be down only approximately 
the press release also noted  while we are disappointed with the pace of our current orders  many of our customers have expressed confidence that we will be able to ship in a more timely fashion  enabling them to reorder more frequently 
our own successful initiative to  for the first time  have actual samples for all of our village lines at the early gift shows  coupled with earlier product availability  may support or reinforce this belief of our dealers 
this potential change in our historical order pattern  combined with other analyses  suggests that the gap in our order trends may close as we progress through the year 
it is important to keep in mind that  as history has shown  where we are in terms of orders at this point in the year is not necessarily indicative of where we will end up at the end of the first quarter or even the year 
the press release further stated the company expects certain costs that impacted its results to continue in fiscal  primarily related to the ongoing information systems implementation and distribution facility consolidation costs 
in addition  continued strategic investments in the company s infrastructure  including business to business e commerce initiatives  are expected to result in higher costs in fiscal in order to position greater operational efficiencies and merchandising effectiveness for the company and its dealers in the future 
as a result  the company believes that fiscal earnings per share will be below that of fiscal results  excluding the impact of its stock repurchase initiatives i am pleased to report that our systems have performed well during the gift shows and that our shipping and invoicing operations are back to normal 
feedback from our dealers suggests that they view our current product offering as one of the strongest ever  ms 
engel continued 
we continue to be excited about the quality and breadth of our product development capabilities 
we maintain our belief that investment in our infrastructure is necessary to sustain our industry leadership  maximize long term growth and create value for our shareholders 
therefore  we remain committed to investing in programs that insure the success of our current dealer base 
at the same time  we will continue to look toward other avenues that will allow us to leverage our current skills and achieve our growth objectives 
additionally  the company announced it completed a million strategic minority investment in day designs  inc  a manufacturer and marketer of high quality accent furniture and wooden accessories sold primarily through furniture  home furnishings  and catalog retailers 
we are excited about the opportunity that we have to partner with an organization that possesses a creative skill set much like ours 
the management of day has proven success in marketing differentiated products  and we are excited about the access to new channels that this investment creates  said ms

the terms of the transaction were not disclosed 
on form k dated february   the company stated in addition to the statements contained in the press release  the company expects that its fiscal gross margin rate ie  the amount that gross profit represents as a percentage of net sales will approximate or slightly exceed its fiscal gross margin rate 
the company expects that its fiscal selling  general administrative expenses sg a will reflect approximately million in infrastructure and strategic initiative expenses in addition to the company s usual and customary sg a expenses 
the expected incremental infrastructure and strategic initiative expenses are attributable primarily to costs associated with the company s ongoing information systems implementation  distribution facility consolidation and direct retail initiatives  as well as a new business to business e commerce initiative 
the company also notes that a reduced base of net sales for fiscal would imply a current year deleveraging of its total sg a expenses 
the federal securities laws provide safe harbor status to certain statements that go beyond historical information and which may provide an indication of future results 
any conclusions or expectations expressed in  or drawn from  the statements in the press release or the form k or throughout this annual report concerning matters that are not historical corporate financial results are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s expectations regarding earnings per share are based on the company s expectations for sales and operating margin 
the company s sales expectations for are based on the company s current forecast of dealer orders and planned sales through its retail arm  and is further dependent on the timing and extent of promotional and marketing efforts undertaken by the company as well as the timing and extent of product receipts and shipments  the efficiency of information systems developed to collect  compile and execute customer orders  and retailer and consumer demand 
dealer orders have principally been dependent on the amount  quality and market acceptance of the new product introductions and retailer demand  but order patterns have historically varied in number  mix and timing  and there can be no assurance that the year to date order levels or trends will not deteriorate  or that they will exhibit levels or trends supportive of a shift toward greater orders later in the year 
moreover  the company s order forecasting model is dependent on assumptions concerning retail inventory levels  consumer demand  and dealer expectations 
the company s operating margin may be impacted by  amongst other factors  shifts in product mix and or gross margin  exchange rate fluctuations with countries the company imports from  changes in freight rates and changes in the company s historical selling  general and administrative expense rate  including bad debts 
if not otherwise mentioned  other factors  including consumer acceptance of new products  product development efforts  identification and retention of sculpting and other talent  completion of third party product manufacturing  dealer reorders and order cancellations  control of operating expenses  corporate cash flow application  including share repurchases  cost of debt capital  functionality of information  operating and distribution systems  identification  completion and results of acquisitions  investments  and other strategic business initiatives  capital expenditures and depreciation  and the timing thereof  grants of stock options or other equity equivalents  actual or deemed exercises of stock options  and industry  general economic  regulatory  transportation  and international trade and monetary conditions  can significantly impact the company s sales  earnings and earnings per share 
actual results may vary materially from forward looking statements and the assumptions on which they are based 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or publish in the future any forward looking statements
