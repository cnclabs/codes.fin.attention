activity has also increased in texas 
the unconsolidated california projects from which significant equity in earnings was derived through early fiscal are substantially completed

the increase in closings was due primarily to stronger demand in the company s nevada and texas markets and the addition of several projects in arizona and colorado  offset by reduction in closings attributable to the buildout of certain california projects 
the decrease in average sales price is due to the shift in relative unit closings from the higher priced california market to the company s other markets

the company s actual gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal  and the pro forma gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to a larger volume of closings in the higher margin joint ventures during fiscal selling  general and administrative expense of million for fiscal decreased million or as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to higher unit closings and higher margins in the ongoing joint ventures  principally grand coto estates  lp and mpe partners  mpe mpe

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash requirements are for the acquisition  development  construction  marketing and overhead of its projects 
the need to stage the acquisition and use of raw materials such as land and finished lots and the need  on certain projects  to construct community facilities ahead of the start of home construction requires homebuilders such as the company to commit working capital for longer periods than many traditional manufacturing companies 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures 
at the current time  all material financing transactions and arrangements are incurred either by cph llc or by certain project specific entities 
as of february   the company has in place several credit facilities with contingent availabilities totaling million the facilities with various bank lenders the banks  of which million was outstanding 
the facilities are secured by liens on various completed or under construction homes and lots held by cph llc and cph newport coast  llc  a consolidated joint venture 
pursuant to the facilities  cph llc is subject to certain covenants  which require  among other things  the maintenance of a consolidated liabilities to net worth ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum net worth and loss limitations  all as defined in the documents that evidence the facilities 
at february   cph llc was in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities also define certain events that constitute events of default 
as of february   no such event had occurred 
commitment fees are payable annually on some of the facilities 
homebuilding activity is being financed out of cph llc cash  bank financing  and the existing joint ventures  including joint ventures with institutional investors  including chf  the investor in cph llc 
in addition  development work undertaken in certain of the company s joint ventures is financed through various non recourse lending arrangements 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize both third party financing and joint ventures to cover financing needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
in may  the company completed the sale of million of senior notes including  warrants to purchase common stock 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay certain debt of the company  acquire certain properties and for general working capital and construction purposes 
the obligations associated with the senior notes have been transferred from the company to cph llc 
the senior notes are due may  during fiscal  the company repurchased million of the senior notes 
the indenture to which the senior notes are subject contains restrictions on cph llc on the incurring of indebtedness  which affect the availability of the facilities based on various measures of the financial performance of cph llc 
subject to such restrictions  the facilities are available to augment cash flow from operations and joint venture financing to fund the cph llc s operations 
management expects that cash flow generated from operations and from additional financing permitted by the terms of the indenture will be sufficient to cover the debt service and to fund cph llc s current development and homebuilding activities for the reasonably foreseeable future  and expects that capital commitments from its joint venture partners and other bank facilities will provide sufficient financing for the operation of its joint ventures 
interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land prices  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes  land and other real estate properties may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of construction costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s homebuilding revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
asset impairment charge during fiscal  in connection with the restructuring and recapitalization of the company discussed above  management completed a process of reevaluating and revising the company s business plan  including its plans for the development of its various projects 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that certain of the company s projects would require an impairment charge when evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  management determined that certain warranty related reserves should be adjusted 
therefore  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge of million 
year compliance the company incurred approximately million in connection with yk readiness  including hardware  software  consulting fees  and other expenses 
the company does not expect to incur significant additional expenditures in the course of completing its yk compliance program 
as of may   the company is not aware of any significant yk issues which have impacted its operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  companies are required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statements of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective march  currently  the company does not have any instruments that would qualify as derivatives under sfas accordingly  the company does not believe sfas would have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity at the current time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt 
currently  the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of february  many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
the company uses debt financing primarily for the purpose of acquiring and developing land and constructing and selling homes 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund these expenditures 
in addition  the company has previously issued million in fixed rate debt to provide longer term financing 
at february   million of the senior notes remain outstanding 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at february   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest incurred for the coming year of approximately million 
the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for debt for each category based upon the expected maturity dates 
the carrying value of the company s variable rate debt approximates fair value due to the frequency of repricing of this debt 
the company s fixed rate debt consists of the senior notes payable 
the senior notes payable are publicly traded debt instruments and their fair values are based on their quoted market prices as of february  expected maturity date year ending february  fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands liabilities fixed rate debt    average interest rate variable rate debt     average interest rate the company does not believe that the future market rate risks related to the above securities will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity
