operating segments lucent operates in the global telecommunications networking industry and has two reportable segments service provider networks spn and microelectronics and communications technologies mct 
spn provides public networking systems  software and services to telecommunications service providers and public network operators around the world 
mct provides high performance optoelectronic components and integrated circuits  power systems and optical fiber for applications in the communications and computing industries 
in addition  mct also includes lucent s new ventures business 
the results of other smaller units and corporate operations are reported in other and corporate 
the two reportable operating segments are strategic market units that offer distinct products and services 
these segments were determined based on the customers and the markets that lucent serves 
each market unit is managed separately as each operation requires different technologies and marketing strategies 
as a result of reorganization initiatives see key business challenges  the company is evaluating changes to its management model and organizational structure which will result in changes to the reportable segments in the next fiscal year

chart 
product and service revenues for the year ended september  core networking systems wireless products microelectronics netcare professional services other key business challenges lucent is in the process of reorganizing its business to become more focused and better positioned to capitalize on market opportunities 
this reorganization includes the recent spin off of avaya  the expected sale of the power systems business and the announced ipo and spin off of agere systems  as well as a comprehensive review and restructuring of lucent s internal systems and processes 
specific initiatives include performing a comprehensive product and service portfolio review aimed at aligning research and development and effective redeployment of sales and marketing teams and other investments as appropriate  consolidating corporate infrastructure and improving supply chain management 
lucent expects to take a significant business restructuring charge in the quarter ending march  lucent expects to give details of the charge in late january  a review of our internal processes will continue throughout and may result in additional restructuring and associated charges 
the reorganization  including the spin off of agere systems  is expected to be completed by september  a limited number of large customers provide a substantial portion of lucent s revenues 
these customers include verizon  at t and certain incumbent and competitive local exchange carriers 
the spending patterns of these customers can vary significantly during the year 
an elimination or change in the spending patterns of  or a significant reduction in orders from  any one of these customers could negatively affect lucent s operating results 
lucent s fiscal year results were negatively affected by the decline in sales to one large us customer and one large us customer 
the communications industry has recently experienced a consolidation of both us and us companies 
as a result  lucent s operating results could become more dependent on a smaller number of large carriers 
lucent continually endeavors to diversify its customer base by adding new and different types of customers 
lucent  however  is often required to provide or arrange for long term financing for customers as a condition to obtain or bid on infrastructure contracts 
thus  our ability to develop certain customer relationships may be dependent upon our ability to raise capital and extend credit 
lucent operates in a highly competitive industry and expects the level of competition relating to pricing and product offerings will intensify 
lucent expects that new competitors will enter its markets as a result of expansion by market participants and advancements in technology 
these competitors may include entrants from the telecommunications  software  data networking  cable television and semiconductor industries  and may have strong financial capabilities  technological expertise and established name recognition 
lucent attempts to direct the company s resources to meet market needs and competitive challenges based on ongoing assessments of market conditions 
however  due to misjudgment of the market demand for specific product offerings  lucent s results for fiscal year were adversely affected by a larger than expected reduction in revenue and gross margin for its traditional circuit switching products and related software  and lower revenues and gross margins for specific optical networking products 
for the first fiscal quarter of  lucent anticipates a substantial decline in revenues compared to the year ago quarter  and a substantial loss from continuing operations 
this reflects a significant sales decline in north america due to an overall softening in the competitive local exchange carrier market  slowdown in capital spending by established service providers  lower software sales and a more focused use of vendor financing by lucent 
on december   moody s investors service lowered lucent s credit rating on senior unsecured long term debt from a to a and on commercial paper from prime to prime  the a rating remains on review for possible further downgrade  and moody s concluded the review of the commercial paper rating 
also on december   standard poor s lowered lucent s credit rating on senior unsecured long term debt from a to bbb and the commercial paper rating from a to a  both of which remain on creditwatch with the possibility of further downgrades 
lucent believes that it will have sufficient capital resources to fulfill its own operational and capital needs  as well as to extend credit to customers when appropriate  although there can be no assurance that this will occur

lower than expected revenues in optical networking  due primarily to being late to market with the oc product  which affected the entire product cycle  from engineering and manufacturing to deployment and launch  had a negative impact on the fiscal year s revenue growth 
in addition  lower revenues from switching products primarily due to the shift in customer spending away from circuit switching  pricing pressures and the impact of a substantial reduction in a major long term foreign project also negatively impacted growth 
the increases resulted primarily from higher sales of switching and wireless systems products with associated software  optical networking and data networking systems and communications software

in addition  component shortages have led to a longer than expected full volume ramp up in optical networking 
revenues in from the mct segment increased  or  million  compared with this increase was driven by sales of optical fiber  optoelectronic components  power systems  wired and wireless lan systems and customized chips for computing and high speed communications systems

this decrease in gross margin percentage was partially offset by million resulting from lower personnel costs  including lower incentive compensation awards and a higher net pension credit  and the impact of adopting sop in addition  lucent anticipates a further shift from higher margin switching products to newer products with initially lower margins

the current year expense was also negatively impacted by increased reserves for bad debt on trade receivables due to specific credit concerns primarily in the emerging service provider market 
these increases were partially offset by million resulting from lower personnel costs  including lower incentive compensation awards and a higher net pension credit  and the impact of adopting sop in addition  included in the current year expense is million primarily associated with the mergers with ins  excel and xedia

as a result of the acquisition activity  lucent expects amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles to significantly increase in future periods 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the acquisitions occurred on october   the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles would have increased by approximately million for the year ended september  the increase largely relates to the million write off of livingston goodwill and other acquired intangibles

interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt levels in and in addition  interest expense in increased from higher weighted average interest rates on commercial paper 
the effective income tax rates exceed the us federal statutory income tax rates primarily due to the write offs of iprd costs and merger related expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the adjusted income tax rate decreased percentage points in compared with this decrease was primarily due to increased research tax credits and the tax impact of non us activity 
the adjusted income tax rate decreased percentage points in compared with this decrease was primarily due to a reduced state effective tax rate and the tax impact of non us activity 
the effective income tax rate does not include a federal income tax provision for kenan since kenan was an s corporation prior to its merger with lucent 
cash flows dollars in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities    financing activities   cash provided by operating activities increased  million to million in compared with this improvement was primarily due to smaller increases in receivables  other operating assets and liabilities and a larger tax benefit from stock options exercised during the current year 
the change in receivables resulted from smaller revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of as compared with the same period in  partially offset by a higher average days outstanding see financial condition 
these improvements were partially offset by increased inventories and contracts in process to meet current and anticipated sales commitments to customers and the start up of several long term projects  lower accounts payable due to the timing of payments and lower net income as adjusted for non cash operating items 
cash from operating activities decreased  million in compared with this was primarily due to larger increases in receivables and inventories as well as lower decreases in payroll and benefit related liabilities 
cash payments of million were charged against the business restructuring reserves in  compared with million in all projects associated with the business restructuring reserve were substantially completed as of september  cash used in investing activities increased million to  million in compared with the increase was primarily due to increased capital expenditures see below and decreased proceeds from the sales of investments  partially offset by decreased purchases of investments and higher proceeds from the dispositions of businesses 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared with  primarily due to increased proceeds from the sales of investments and a reduction in cash used for acquisitions and purchases of investments  partially offset by increased capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were  million   million and  million for  and  respectively 
the increases in capital expenditures primarily relate to expenditures for equipment and facilities used in manufacturing and research and development  including expansion of manufacturing capacity  and expenditures for efficiency improvements and non us growth 
in addition  in capital expenditures included capitalized internal use software 
cash provided by financing activities decreased  million to  million in compared with this decrease was primarily due to lower issuances of long term debt and increases in repayments of long term debt  partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings and an increase in proceeds from the issuances of common stock primarily for stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities increased  million in compared with this increase was primarily due to increased issuances of debt 
financial condition dollars in millions total assets   total liabilities   working capital   debt to total capital debt plus equity inventory turnover ratio x x average days outstanding receivables days days total assets as of september   increased  million  or  from september  this increase was primarily from increases of  million in goodwill and other acquired intangibles  as well as from increases in receivables  inventories  contracts in process  prepaid pension costs  and other assets of million   million  million  million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net assets of discontinued operations of million as a result of completing the avaya spin off on september  the increase in goodwill and other acquired intangibles is due to the acquisitions made in fiscal see acquisitions 
receivables increased primarily due to higher sales volume coupled with a higher average days outstanding see below 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  approximately million of receivables for one large non us customer were sold 
the increase in inventories resulted from the need to meet current and anticipated sales commitments to customers 
contracts in process increased as a result of the start up of several long term projects 
prepaid pension costs increased primarily due to higher return on plan assets and an increase in the discount rate in other assets increased due largely to the capitalization of internal use software  increased investments and an increase in other intangible assets 
the fair value of lucent s pension plan assets is greater than the projected pension obligations 
lucent records pension income when the expected return on plan assets plus amortization of the transition asset is greater than the interest cost on the projected benefit obligation plus service cost for the year and amortization of prior service cost 
total liabilities increased  million  or  from september  this increase was due primarily to higher commercial paper balances 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  increased million from september   primarily resulting from an increase in receivables  inventories and contracts in process  partially offset by the increase in short term debt 
debt to total capital decreased basis points in compared with this decrease was related to the increase in additional paid in capital primarily associated with the issuance of common stock for business acquisitions made during the year and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of stock options and sales of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended september   lucent s inventory turnover ratio decreased to x compared with x for the year ended september  the decrease is due to higher inventory in fiscal inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing cost of sales for the three months ended september by the fiscal fourth quarter average ending inventory balance  using a two point average 
average days outstanding receivables were up days to days in compared with reflecting the growth in lucent s sales outside the united states  which typically carry longer payment terms and growth in very competitive emerging markets that currently require longer payment terms 
average days outstanding is calculated by dividing the fiscal fourth quarter average ending receivables balance  using a two point average  by total revenues for the three months ended september liquidity and capital resources lucent expects that  from time to time  outstanding commercial paper balances may be replaced with short or long term borrowings as market conditions permit 
at september   lucent maintained approximately billion in credit facilities  of which a portion is used to support lucent s commercial paper program 
at september   approximately billion was unused 
future financings will be arranged to meet lucent s requirements with the timing  amount and form of issue depending on the prevailing market and general economic conditions 
lucent anticipates that borrowings under its bank credit facilities  the issuance of additional commercial paper  cash generated from operations  short and long term debt financings  receivable securitizations  the expected proceeds from the sale of the power systems business and the planned ipo of agere systems will be adequate to satisfy its future cash requirements  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
lucent s customers worldwide are requiring their suppliers to arrange or provide long term financing for them as a condition of obtaining or bidding on infrastructure projects 
these projects may require financing in amounts ranging from modest sums to more than a billion dollars 
lucent has increasingly provided or arranged long term financing for customers  and continually monitors and reviews the creditworthiness of such arrangements 
as market conditions permit  lucent s intention is to sell or transfer these long term financing arrangements  which may include both commitments and drawn down borrowings  to financial institutions and other investors 
this enables lucent to reduce the amount of its commitments and free up additional financing capacity 
as of september   lucent had made commitments or entered into agreements to extend credit to certain customers for an aggregate of approximately billion 
excluding amounts that are not available because the customer has not yet satisfied the conditions precedent for borrowing  at september   approximately billion in loan commitments was undrawn and available for borrowing and approximately billion had been advanced and was outstanding 
as part of the revenue recognition process  lucent determines whether the notes receivable under these contracts are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors  among which is the ability of lucent to sell these notes 
in addition  lucent had made commitments to guarantee customer debt of about billion at september  excluding amounts not available for guarantee because conditions precedent have not been satisfied  approximately million of guarantees was undrawn and available and about million was outstanding on september  in addition to the above arrangements  lucent will continue to provide or commit to financing where appropriate for its business 
the ability of lucent to arrange or provide financing for its customers will depend on a number of factors  including lucent s capital structure  credit rating and level of available credit  and its continued ability to sell or transfer commitments and drawn down borrowings on acceptable terms 
lucent believes that it will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts that will be satisfactory to lucent and that it will be able to obtain bid and performance bonds  to arrange or provide customer financing as necessary  and to engage in hedging transactions on commercially acceptable terms  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
for a discussion of the company s sales of receivables and notes  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
risk management lucent is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
lucent manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
lucent uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage lucent s exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 
certain securities held in lucent s equity and investment portfolio are subject to equity price risk 
lucent generally does not hedge its equity price risk  however  on occasion  may use equity derivative financial instruments that are subject to equity price risks to complement its investment strategies 
as of september   lucent had no outstanding positions 
lucent uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to reduce significant exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflows and outflows resulting from the sale of products to non us customers and purchases from non us suppliers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
foreign exchange forward contracts are designated for recorded  firmly committed or anticipated purchases and sales 
the use of these derivative financial instruments allows lucent to reduce its overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since the gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
as of september   lucent s primary net foreign currency market exposures were dispersed through various countries and primarily included the euro and its legacy currencies 
as of september   lucent s primary net foreign currency market exposures included canadian dollars and brazilian reals 
lucent has not changed its policy regarding how such exposures are managed since the year ended september  management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of september  and  a appreciation in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar from the prevailing market rates would result in an incremental net unrealized loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in an incremental net unrealized gain of approximately million and million  as of september  and  respectively 
consistent with the nature of the economic hedge of such foreign exchange forward contracts  such unrealized gains or losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases  respectively  of the underlying instrument or transaction being hedged 
while lucent hedges certain foreign currency transactions  the decline in value of non us dollar currencies may  if not reversed  adversely affect lucent s ability to contract for product sales in us dollars because lucent s products may become more expensive to purchase in us dollars for local customers doing business in the countries of the affected currencies 
lucent manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  lucent  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts 
lucent had no material interest rate swap agreements in effect at september  or management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
the fair value of lucent s fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains losses in the market value of this debt due to differences between the market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at september  and  the market value of lucent s fixed rate long term debt would be reduced by approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the market value of lucent s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at september  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of livingston  yurie  stratus  agere  ortel  chromatis and spring tide  lucent allocated non tax impacting charges of million  million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively  of the total purchase price to iprd 
as part of the process of analyzing each of these acquisitions  lucent made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
lucent based this decision on a number of factors including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market 
lucent also considered bell labs resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology  if any 
lucent management expects to use the same decision process in the future 
lucent estimated the fair value of iprd for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the iprd using the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the iprd  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of lucent s weighted average cost of capital  as well as other factors  including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
lucent believes that the estimated iprd amounts so determined represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
where appropriate  lucent deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of the core technology from the anticipated cash flows from an iprd project 
at the date of acquisition  the iprd projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value allocated to these projects was capitalized and immediately expensed at acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or are not completed in a timely manner  management s anticipated product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and lucent may not realize the financial benefits expected from the projects 
set forth below are descriptions of significant acquired iprd projects livingston on december   lucent completed the purchase of livingston 
livingston was involved in the development of equipment used by internet service providers to connect subscribers to the internet 
the allocation to iprd of million represented its estimated fair value using the methodology described above 
approximately million was allocated to the portmaster  a remote access concentrator targeted at large independent telecommunication companies  cable television companies and internet service providers  and the remaining million was allocated to another project 
revenues attributable to the portmaster were estimated to be million in and million in revenue was expected to peak in and decline thereafter through the end of the product s life as new product technologies were expected to be introduced by lucent 
revenue growth was expected to decrease from in to in and be negative for the remainder of the projection period 
at the acquisition date  costs to complete the research and development efforts related to the portmaster were expected to be million 
a risk adjusted discount rate of was used to discount projected cash flows 
livingston s portmaster was commercially released in july and started generating revenues immediately after commercial launch 
as a result of the merger between lucent and ascend in june  the decision was made to discontinue future development and sales of the portmaster platform in order to maximize research and development efficiency by concentrating on the max tnt platform 
instead of having two platforms to address the full spectrum of access switching products  lucent will be able to have one platform that can address a broad spectrum of applications while minimizing duplicative research and development

given the uncertainties of the development process  the aforementioned estimates are subject to change  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
management expects to continue development of these efforts and believes there is a reasonable chance of successfully completing the development efforts 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there can be no assurance that the projects will realize either technological or commercial success 
failure to successfully develop and commercialize the iprd would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation

therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
lucent undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include increasing price  products and services competition by us and us competitors  including new entrants  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the mix of products and services  the availability of manufacturing capacity  components and materials  the ability to recruit and retain talent  the achievement of lower costs and expenses  credit concerns in the emerging service provider market  customer demand for the company s products and services  the ability to successfully integrate the operations and business of acquired companies  timely completion of the proposed ipo and spin off of agere systems and the sale of the power systems business  the successful implementation of the strategic reorganization  us and us governmental and public policy changes that may affect the level of new investments and purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other us and us governmental regulations  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers and significant suppliers  the ability to supply customer financing  technological  implementation and cost financial risks in the use of large  multiyear contracts  the company s credit ratings  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future business

in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general us and us economic conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors 
competition see discussion under key business challenges 
dependence on new product development the markets for the company s principal products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating communications systems for service providers and other customers 
the company s operating results will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce new systems  products  software and services successfully on a timely basis and to reduce costs of existing systems  products  software and services 
the success of these and other new offerings is dependent on several factors  including proper identification of customer needs  cost  timely completion and introduction  differentiation from offerings of the company s competitors and market acceptance 
in addition  new technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability  including  in some cases  certification by non us and us standard setting bodies 
reliance on major customers see discussion under key business challenges 
european monetary union euro several member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro and have adopted the euro as their new single legal currency 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period until january  during the transition period  cashless payments can be made in the euro 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
lucent has in place a joint european united states team representing affected functions within the company 
this team is evaluating euro related issues affecting the company that include its pricing marketing strategy  conversion of information technology systems and existing contracts 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
lucent will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the euro as further accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance is available 
based on current information and lucent s current assessment  lucent does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
multiyear contracts lucent has significant contracts for the sale of infrastructure systems to network operators that extend over multiyear periods and expects to enter into similar contracts in the future  with uncertainties affecting recognition of revenues  stringent acceptance criteria  implementation of new technologies and possible significant initial cost overruns and losses

future capital requirements see discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
non us growth  foreign exchange rates and interest rates lucent intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in non us markets 
in many non us markets  long standing relationships between potential customers of lucent and their local providers  and protective regulations  including local content requirements and type approvals  create barriers to entry 
in addition  pursuit of such non us growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on such investments  if any  are realized 
such projects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of non us markets to new competitors  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  investment policies  repatriation of cash  nationalization  social and political risks  taxation  and other factors  depending on the country in which such opportunity arises 
difficulties in non us financial markets and economies  and of non us financial institutions  could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries 
see discussion under risk management with respect to foreign exchange and interest rates 
a significant change in the value of the us dollar against the currency of one or more countries where lucent sells products to local customers or makes purchases from local suppliers may materially adversely affect lucent s results 
lucent attempts to mitigate any such effects through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  although there can be no assurances that such attempts will be successful
