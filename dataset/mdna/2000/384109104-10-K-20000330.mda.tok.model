the decrease from the percent rate in is due primarily to foreign earnings being taxed at lower effective rates 
the effective tax rate of percent was higher than the rate of percent principally due to foreign earnings being taxed at higher effective rates and the full utilization in of tax benefits associated with previously reserved foreign subsidiary net operating losses 
reconciliations of the us federal tax rate to the effective rates for  and are included in note e to the consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as discussed under foreign currency effects  graco sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
graco uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce risks associated with foreign currency net balance sheet positions 
these contracts typically have maturities of days or less  and gains or losses from changes in market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet items 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the european euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound  and korean won 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to evaluate its currency exchange rate risks on its foreign exchange contracts  the company uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact on earnings of hypothetical changes in the value of foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
at december   due to the short term nature of the company s hedging instruments  reasonably likely fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect graco s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
at december   a basis point increase or decrease in the market interest rates  principally libor  would not materially increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows 
for further discussion of the company s foreign currency and interest rate hedging strategy and position  see note a to the consolidated financial statements

we released the new line for sale in the first quarter of and expect meaningful incremental revenues and profits 
graco has changed a number of business processes in recent years that have improved its effectiveness in the markets it serves  and has increased the company s operating margins and net profits 
these efforts will continue to favorably impact margins and profits in graco has achieved strong returns on its pension assets in recent years 
we are expecting that these strong returns will have a favorable impact on earnings in we anticipate that the continued strength of the us dollar relative to other major currencies will have a slightly negative impact on operating margins in safe harbor cautionary statement the information in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements about the company s expectations of the future  which are subject to certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expectations
