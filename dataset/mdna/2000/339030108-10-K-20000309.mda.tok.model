in order to understand this section in context  it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
net interest income year ended december fte basis in millions interest income    tax equivalent adjustment interest expense    net interest income    the million  or  increase in net interest income for compared to was due principally to higher interest income resulting from strong loan growth in the domestic commercial and lease financing portfolios  primarily loans and leases from the sanwa acquisition 
net interest margin and interest rate spread year ended december fte basis average average dollars in millions balance rate balance rate securities   loans and leases domestic   international   due from brokers dealers   mortgages held for resale   other   total interest earning   assets deposits   short term borrowings   due to brokers dealers   long term debt   interest bearing   liabilities interest rate spread interest free sources of   funds total sources of funds   net interest margin net interest margin represents the relationship between net interest income and average earning assets 
net interest margin is affected by several factors  including fluctuations in the overall interest rate environment  funding strategies of the corporation  the mix of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and noninterest bearing liabilities  as well as the use of interest rate derivatives that are used to manage interest rate risk 
net interest margin for declined basis points to 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a higher level of low yielding earning assets necessary to support an expanded investment banking operation  as well as an increased reliance on wholesale funding 
average securities increased billion to billion in  due primarily to increases in international investments and marketable equity securities 
average domestic loans and leases increased billion to billion in  due primarily to the sanwa acquisition 
other interest earning assets increased billion to billion during  as a result of an increase in money market instruments necessary to support an expanded investment banking operation 
average interest bearing deposits increased billion to billion in  primarily the result of increased domestic money market deposits  partially offset by a decline in savings and now balances and domestic time deposits 
average short term borrowings increased billion to billion during  due to increases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase necessary to support an expanded investment banking operation  partially offset by declines in other short term borrowings 
the billion increase in average long term debt was due primarily to net increases in senior and subordinated debt and bank notes used to fund acquisitions and loan growth 
the basis point decrease in the funding rate was due to the issuance of additional debt at lower floating interest rates 
it is anticipated that the average rate on the corporation s long term portfolio will more closely track movements in short term interest rates  such as the london interbank offered rate libor  the prime rate and the federal funds rate 
these indices are closely related to the underlying assets responsible for recent balance sheet growth 
noninterest income year ended december in millions capital markets revenue   investment services revenue   banking fees and commissions    credit card revenue processing related revenue gains on branch divestitures and sales of businesses other noninterest income total noninterest income    noninterest income totaled billion for  up  compared to billion for this increase reflects growth in many of the corporation s businesses  such as quick reilly and robertson stephens  and includes the full year impact of the acquisition of robertson stephens  versus four months in as a result of intensified competition and changing customer needs in the financial services industry  the corporation has made strategic decisions directed at enhancing future fee revenue producing activities

these results include the full year impact of robertson stephens in compared to four months in  as well as strong growth within their business lines during in addition to the impact of this acquisition  much of the increase in these revenues was a result of the unprecedented strength in the us capital markets  particularly the technology sector

thus  the level of such revenues in the future cannot be predicted with certainty

advisory fees include fees received for providing financial advice on mergers and acquisitions  private clients transactions and other transactions 
trading profits and commissions rose million to million in  primarily the result of the inclusion of robertson stephens for a full year in and the absence of losses incurred in in the emerging markets and high yield trading portfolios

syndication agency fees increased million to million in  as a result of higher transactional volume during securities gains declined million as a result of fewer transactions in the securities available for sale portfolio in response to the interest rate risk position of the corporation and the overall interest rate environment  as well as impairment losses which were recorded on certain securities 
investment services revenue year ended december in millions investment management revenue brokerage fees and commissions total investment services   revenue investment services revenue increased million  or  in to billion 
changes in these revenues are discussed in more detail below 
investment management revenue year ended december in millions private clients group institutional businesses international retail investments columbia management company other total investment management revenue rose million  or  in to million 
this improvement was due to the rise in the domestic equities market  which led to increased sales of annuities and mutual fund products  and increased the value of assets under management from approximately billion at december  to approximately billion at december  internationally  the corporation is among the largest mutual fund providers in argentina and brazil 
brokerage fees and commissions brokerage fees and commissions increased million  or in to million  due to the aforementioned acquisition of robertson stephens  increased transactional activity at quick reilly  and higher clearing levels within us clearing as a result of the strong performance in the domestic equity markets 
banking fees and commissions banking fees and commissions  which includes fees received for cash management  deposit accounts  electronic banking and other service fees  increased million  or  to billion in the increase was due principally to the continuing development of new product packaging and fee schedules  as well as growth in the corporation s customer base 
credit card revenue credit card revenue increased million  or  to million in  primarily the result of increased securitization revenue due to higher volumes  as well as a full year impact of portfolio acquisitions 
increased securitization revenue was a direct result of a strategic repositioning from a primarily one product portfolio to a multi product portfolio  which focused on replacing promotional rate products with stable fixed rate products 
the corporation services billion of securitized and owned credit card receivables 
the primary components of credit card revenue are related to the corporation s securitization activities 
these activities result in securitization income  servicing revenue  interchange fees  and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the securitization of credit card receivables changes the corporation s status from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer 
accordingly  there is a change in the classification of the revenue associated with the securitization which is reported in the income statement 
the corporation s revenue over the term of a securitization transaction may vary depending upon the credit performance of the securitized receivables  because credit losses become a component of the cash flows arising from the securitized receivables 
the following table depicts the consolidated financial statement impact as if the securitized credit card receivables had  in fact  been owned  as well as additional financial information pertaining to credit card receivables

mortgage banking revenue  net year ended december in millions net loan servicing revenue mortgage production revenue gains on sales of mortgage servicing amortization impairment charge total mortgage banking revenue  net net mortgage banking revenue in increased million  or  from million in this increase was due principally to increased net loan servicing revenue and a decline in mortgage servicing rights msrs amortization impairment  offset by a decline in the level of sales of mortgage servicing and decreased mortgage production revenue 
net loan servicing revenue represents fees received for servicing residential mortgage loans 
the million  or  increase in net loan servicing revenue is attributable to the growth in the size of the servicing portfolio from approximately billion at december  to approximately billion at december  mortgage production revenue includes income derived from the loan origination process and gains on sales of mortgage originations 
mortgage production revenue declined in  but remained strong as loan production volume equaled record levels 
the corporation did not recognize any gain on the sales of msrs during the corporation s decision to sell msrs depends on a variety of factors  including the available markets and current market prices for such servicing rights 
msr amortization decreased million to million in  due to the absence of a million impairment charge recorded in caused by the low mortgage rate environment 
since msrs are an interest rate sensitive asset  the value of the corporation s mortgage servicing portfolio and related mortgage banking revenue may be adversely impacted if mortgage interest rates decline and actual or expected loan prepayments increase 
for additional information regarding pre payment risk  refer to the asset liability management section of this discussion 
other gains on branch divestitures and sales of businesses consisted of a million gain on the corporation s sale of its interest in a credit card venture in results included a million gain from the corporation s sale of its interest in homeside  inc  an independent mortgage banking company  and gains of million and million related to the sales of the bankboston berkshire county  massachusetts franchise and domestic institutional custody business  respectively

the corporation recorded merger and restructuring related charges and other costs totaling billion and million in and  respectively  and gains on sales of businesses of million and million in and  respectively 
all other had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to the aforementioned merger and restructuring related charges and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of in connection with the merger with bankboston  as well as the absence of the gains realized on sales of businesses in financial condition total assets increased billion to billion as of december   the result of increases in trading assets  investment securities  mortgage servicing rights and strong loan growth  offset  in part  by a decrease in mortgages held for resale 
in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals for the merger with bankboston  the corporation agreed to divest billion of deposits and billion of loans 
these divestitures will occur in total loans at december  were billion  an increase of  compared with billion at december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of sanwa and strong loan growth in the domestic commercial loan and lease financing portfolios  offset  in part  by securitization activity of billion 
total deposits decreased billion to billion at december  the decrease was due principally to declines of billion in domestic regular savings and now deposits  billion in domestic time deposits and million in international deposits  partially offset by a billion increase in domestic money market deposits resulting from the corporation s efforts to maintain competitive low cost funding sources 
short term borrowings decreased billion to billion at december   primarily the result of a decrease in treasury  tax and loan borrowings 
long term debt increased billion to billion as a result of funding both acquisitions and balance sheet growth 
the corporation s investment securities portfolio plays a significant role in the management of the corporation s balance sheet  as the liquid nature of the securities portfolio enhances the efficiency of the balance sheet 
the amortized cost of securities available for sale increased billion to billion at december   compared to billion at december  the valuation of securities available for sale increased million to a net unrealized gain pre tax position of million at december   due to increases in the value of marketable equity securities  primarily investments held by the corporation s principal investing business

the corporation attempts to control such risk through analysis of credit applications  portfolio diversification and ongoing examinations of outstandings and delinquencies 
the corporation strives to identify potential classified assets as early as possible  to take charge offs promptly based on realistic assessments of probable losses and to maintain an adequate reserve for credit losses 
the corporation s portfolio is well diversified by borrower  industry  product and geographic location  thereby reducing the concentration of credit risk 
total loans and leases increased billion  or  over december  domestic loans and leases increased billion  or  while international loans and leases increased million  or 
the increase in domestic loans and leases was due primarily to the addition of sanwa loans and leases in the first quarter of partially offsetting the increase in domestic loans and leases were securitizations of billion of commercial and industrial c i loans  million of credit card loans and million of home equity loans 
growth in the corporation s international loan portfolio was driven primarily by growth in the brazilian commercial portfolio 
commercial and industrial loans domestic c i loans increased million to billion at december   primarily as a result of the addition of sanwa loans  partially offset by billion of securitizations 
domestic c i borrowers consist primarily of middle market and large corporate customers  and are well diversified as to industry and companies within each industry 
international commercial borrower industry concentrations consist primarily of banking and insurance  transportation  communications and energy production and distribution 
lease financing the corporation is engaged in lease financing on both a domestic and international basis 
domestic lease financing totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the aforementioned acquisition of sanwa 
this acquisition significantly expanded the corporation s geographic presence  existing product line and client base to include lease financing to manufacturers of capital equipment and leasing programs for small businesses 
as a result of this acquisition  the corporation s capital leasing business has become the second ranked bank lessor and one of the top ten leasing companies in the united states

the corporation manages the risk associated with most types of consumer loans by utilizing uniform credit standards when extending credit  together with systems that streamline the process of monitoring delinquencies 
domestic residential real estate loans  secured by one to four family properties  decreased million  or  to billion at december  the million  or  increase in domestic home equity loans was primarily the result of increased mailing campaigns and new products offset  in part  by a million securitization 
domestic credit card loans decreased million to billion at december  the decrease was primarily the result of million of securitizations during  partially offset by growth in the owned portfolio 
installment and other consumer loans increased billion  or  primarily due to an increase in margin loans at quick reilly  as a result of the strong equity markets 
cross border outstandings in accordance with bank regulatory rules  cross border outstandings are amounts payable to the corporation by residents of foreign countries  regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated  and local country claims in excess of local country obligations 
at december   total cross border outstandings were billion  compared with billion at december   which included billion and billion  respectively  of cross border outstandings to emerging markets countries 
excluded from cross border outstandings are the following o local country claims that are funded by local country obligations payable only in the country where issued  regardless of the currency in which the claim or obligation is denominated 
o local country claims funded by non local country obligations typically denominated in us dollars or other non local currency  where the providers of funds agree that  in the event their claims cannot be repaid in the designated currency due to currency exchange restrictions in a given country  they may either accept payment in local currency or wait to receive the non local currency until such time as it becomes available in the local market 
at december   such outstandings related to emerging markets countries totaled billion  compared with billion at december  o claims reallocated as a result of external guarantees  cash collateral  or insurance contracts issued primarily by us government agencies 
cross border outstandings include deposits in other banks  resale agreements  trading securities  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity  loans and lease financing  amounts due from customers on acceptances  accrued interest receivable and revaluation gains on trading derivatives 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
the corporation manages its cross border outstandings using country exposure limits established by the country exposure committee

the corporation performs periodic  systematic reviews of its portfolios to identify these inherent losses  and to assess the overall probability of collection of these portfolios 
these reviews result in the identification and quantification of loss factors  which are used in determining the amount of the reserve for credit losses 
in addition  the corporation periodically evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  including emerging markets risks and cross border outstandings  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
portions of the reserve for credit losses are allocated to cover the estimated losses inherent in each loan and lease category based on the results of this detailed review process 
commercial loans and leases are individually reviewed and assigned a credit risk rating from low risk of loss to high risk of loss 
this process includes the review of loans with a credit risk rating of and above and a principal balance greater than  to determine the need for a specific loan loss allocation 
additionally  derived or calculated loan loss allocations are provided for credit risk rated loans not specifically allocated 
estimated loss factors are provided for loans with a credit risk rating of to based on their specific credit risk rating classification 
the combination of these analyses is the basis for the determination of the commercial loan and lease portions of the reserve for credit losses 
consumer loans  which include credit cards  residential mortgages  home equity loans lines  direct indirect loans  consumer finance and international consumer loans  are generally evaluated as a group based on product type 
the determination of the consumer loan portion of the reserve for credit losses is based on one year of forecasted net credit losses 
this forecast is determined using several modeling tools  including a delinquency roll rate model  a vintage model and a regression model 
small business loans are analyzed in a similar manner based on delinquency migration 
this analysis includes two years of forecasted net credit losses 
the results of the analyses are reviewed and discussed by the corporation s risk management committee  the respective lines of business and the collections group 
a sovereign risk analysis  which assesses the cross border risk of credit loss  is performed as part of the corporation s review of its international commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
testing of forecasted net credit losses and specific allocations of the reserve are performed on a quarterly basis 
adjustments to reserve allocations for specific segments of the loan and lease portfolio may be made as a result of this testing  based on the accuracy of forecasted net credit losses and other credit or policy related issues 
the process used by the corporation to determine the appropriate overall reserve for credit losses is based on this analysis  taking into consideration management s judgment 
reserve methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  including the aforementioned assumptions  the corporation believes that the reserve for credit losses is adequate as of december  loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible  after giving consideration to factors such as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  as well as general and industry economic conditions 
the corporation s reserve for credit losses increased million from december   to billion at december   primarily due to the addition of reserves from the sanwa acquisition 
the provision for credit losses was million  million higher than the prior year provision of million 
the increase in the provision for credit losses was due primarily to a higher level of losses in the domestic c i loan portfolio compared to  and as a result of the sanwa acquisition 
during  the corporation experienced loan growth of billion  or almost  while the reserve for credit losses increased almost 
as a result of core loan growth  the addition of approximately billion in assets from the sanwa acquisition  and continued growth in new initiatives in various lines of business  the risk characteristics of the corporation s loan portfolio continue to change 
additionally  the almost increase in gross charge offs was driven by a increase in gross charge offs in the domestic c i portfolio 
increased charge offs in the c i portfolio were recorded in several lines of business  requiring additional reserves to be allocated to this portfolio 
specifically  reserve allocated to the domestic c i portfolio rose from of the total reserve for credit losses at december  to over at december  an integral component of the corporation s risk management process is to ensure the proper allocation of the reserve for credit losses based upon an analysis of risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  loan segmentations  and other factors 
the unallocated component of the reserve for credit losses represents management s view that  given the complexities of the loan portfolio  there are estimable losses that have been incurred within the portfolio but not yet specifically identified 
this unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions utilized in the allocated reserve calculation

net charge offs in the domestic c i portfolio increased million to million in compared to  primarily the result of relatively lower levels of charge offs in this portfolio in net charge offs in the domestic lease financing portfolio increased million in  primarily the result of the acquisition of sanwa 
international net charge offs decreased million to million in  due primarily to partial insurance recoveries in  and related charge offs in  of certain international private bank loans 
excluding the effects of these recoveries and charge offs  international net charge offs were relatively flat year to year 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased slightly to  compared to 
at december  asset liability management the goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk  liquidity and capital 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the corporation s board of directors the board 
the board delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the corporate asset  liability and capital committee alcco 
alcco sets strategic directives that guide the day to day asset liability management activities of the corporation 
alcco also reviews and approves all major market risk  liquidity  and capital management programs 
market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
as discussed below  the corporation is exposed to market risk in both its non trading and trading operations 
non trading market risk us dollar denominated risk at december   us dollar denominated assets comprised the majority of the corporation s balance sheet 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is by far the most significant non trading market risk to which the us dollar denominated positions are exposed 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of income or financial condition to variations in interest rates 
this risk arises directly from the corporation s core banking activities lending  deposit gathering  and loan servicing 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control the exposure to interest rate risk  both within limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines approved by alcco 
these limits and guidelines reflect the corporation s tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term time horizons 
the corporation controls interest rate risk by identifying  quantifying and hedging its exposures 
the corporation identifies and quantifies its interest rate exposures using sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as simpler gap analyses  reflecting the known or assumed maturity  repricing  and other cash flow characteristics of the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the corporation manages the interest rate risk inherent in its core banking operations using both on balance sheet instruments  mainly fixed rate portfolio securities  and a variety of off balance sheet instruments 
the most frequently used off balance sheet instruments are interest rate swaps and options eg  interest rate caps and floors 
when appropriate  forward rate agreements  options on swaps  and exchange traded futures and options are also used 
the major source of the corporation s non trading interest rate risk is the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities loans and deposits 
this difference  or mismatch  is a risk to net interest income 
most significantly  the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities are mismatched with respect to repricing frequency  maturity and or index 
most of the corporation s commercial loans  for example  reprice rapidly in response to changes in short term interest rates eg  libor and prime rate 
in contrast  many of its consumer deposits reprice slowly  if at all  in response to changes in market interest rates 
as a result  the core bank is asset sensitive 
in managing interest rate risk  the corporation uses fixed rate portfolio securities and interest rate swaps to offset the general asset sensitivity of the core bank 
additionally  the corporation uses interest rate swaps to offset basis risk  including specific exposure to changes in the prime rate 
at december  and  interest rate swaps totaling billion notional amount were being used to manage risk to net interest income 
a second major source of non trading interest rate risk is the sensitivity of msrs to prepayments 
a mortgage borrower has the option to prepay a mortgage loan at any time 
when mortgage interest rates decline  the borrower has a greater incentive to prepay a mortgage loan through a refinancing  when mortgage interest rates rise  this incentive is reduced or eliminated 
since msrs represent the right to service mortgage loans  a decline in interest rates and an actual or probable increase in mortgage prepayments shorten the expected life of the msr asset and reduce the amount of servicing fees to be received and  therefore  the economic value of the msrs 
correspondingly  an increase in interest rates and an actual or probable decline in mortgage prepayments lengthen the expected life of the msr asset and enhance its economic value 
the expected income from and  therefore  the economic value of msrs is sensitive to movements in interest rates due to this sensitivity to mortgage prepayments 
to mitigate the risk of declining long term interest rates  increased mortgage prepayments and the potential impairment of msrs  the corporation uses a variety of risk management instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps and floors tied to constant maturity yields on long term eg  year treasury notes and swaps  options on swaps  exchange traded options on treasury bond and note futures contracts  and swaps linked to mortgage assets such as principal only po securities 
these instruments gain value as interest rates decline  mitigating the impairment of msrs 
at december  and  the corporation had approximately billion and billion notional amount  respectively  of outstanding derivatives being used to manage risk to the msrs valuation 
complicating management s efforts to control non trading exposure to interest rate risk is the fundamental uncertainty of the maturity  repricing  and or runoff characteristics of some of the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities 
this uncertainty often reflects optionality features contained in these financial instruments 
the most important optionality features are contained in consumer deposits and loans 
for example  many of the corporation s interest bearing retail deposit products eg  interest checking  savings and money market deposits have no contractual maturity 
customers have the right to withdraw funds from these deposit accounts freely 
deposit balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changes in competitive or market conditions 
to forestall such runoff  rates on interest bearing deposits may have to be increased more or reduced less than expected 
such repricing may not be highly correlated with the repricing of prime rate based or libor based loans 
finally  balances that leave the banking franchise may have to be replaced with other more expensive retail or wholesale deposits 
given the uncertainties surrounding deposit runoff and repricing  the interest rate sensitivity of core bank liabilities cannot be determined precisely 
similarly  customers have the right to prepay loans  particularly residential mortgage loans  without penalty 
as a result  the corporation s mortgage based assets including mortgage loans and securities as well as msrs are subject to prepayment risk 
this risk tends to increase when interest rates fall due to the benefits of refinancing 
since the future prepayment behavior of the corporation s customers is uncertain  the interest rate sensitivity of mortgage assets cannot be exactly determined 
to cope with such uncertainties  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
for example  assumptions for mortgage prepayments are derived from third party prepayment estimates for comparable mortgage loans 
assumptions for noncontractual deposits are based on a historical analysis of repricing and runoff trends  heavily weighted to the recent past  modified by business judgment concerning prospective competitive market influences 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the corporation uses a variety of methods  including simulation  gap  and valuation analyses 
simulation analysis involves dynamically modeling interest income and expense from the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
the corporation uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income over relatively short eg  year time horizons 
key assumptions in these simulation analyses and in the gap and valuation analyses discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the growth or shrinkage of product balances and the behavior of the corporation s deposit and loan customers 
as indicated above  the most material assumptions relate to the prepayment of mortgage assets  as well as the repricing and or runoff of noncontractual deposits 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  management uses simulation analysis to project earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
some scenarios reflect reasonable or most likely economic forecasts 
other scenarios are deliberately extreme  including immediate interest rate shocks  gradual interest rate ramps  spread narrowings widenings  and yield curve twists 
usually  each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
but in some analyses  assumptions are deliberately manipulated to test the corporation s exposure to assumption risk 
the corporation s board limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the subsequent months should decline by less than 
the corporation was in compliance with this limit at december  and the following table reflects the estimated exposure of the corporation s net interest income for the next months  assuming an immediate shift in interest rates 
this estimated exposure reflects the anticipated divestitures more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
estimated exposure to rate change net interest income basis points in millions management believes that these estimates reflect a complete and accurate representation of the corporation s balance sheet 
it should be emphasized  however  that the estimated exposures set forth above are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
management believes that the exposure of the corporation s net interest income to gradual and or modest changes in interest rates is relatively small 
as indicated by the results of the simulation analysis  a sharp move in interest rates  up or down  will tend to reduce net interest income  but by amounts that are within corporate limits 
this exposure is primarily related to two major risk factors discussed earlier the anticipated repricing runoff of noncontractual deposits and the assumed prepayment of mortgage loans and securities 
valuation analysis involves projecting future cash flows from the corporation s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions over a very long term horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
the corporation s economic value of equity eve is the estimated net present value of the discounted cash flows 
the interest rate sensitivity of eve is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses valuation analysis specifically  the sensitivity of eve to measure the exposure of earnings and equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long eg  year time horizon 
valuation analysis provides a more comprehensive measure of the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk than simulation analysis 
valuation analysis incorporates a longer time horizon and also includes certain interest rate sensitive components of noninterest income  specifically mortgage banking revenue 
the corporation s board limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately up or down basis points  the estimated eve should decline by less than 
the corporation was in compliance with this limit at december  and the following table reflects the corporation s estimated exposure to economic value assuming an immediate shift in interest rates 
this estimated exposure reflects the anticipated divestitures more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
exposures are reported for shifts of basis points  as well as basis points because the sensitivity of eve  in particular the sensitivity of hedged msrs  to changes in interest rates can be nonlinear 
an immediate shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide management with an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario 
a gradual shift in interest rates should have a much more modest impact  due partly to anticipated hedge activity 
estimated exposure to rate change economic value basis points in millions during early  management continued to add fixed rate portfolio securities and interest rate swaps to control the asset sensitivity inherent in the maturity and repricing mismatch of the core bank assets and liabilities 
late in  there were relatively modest additions to portfolio securities and swaps  as the planned deposit divestiture and the continued uptrend in interest rates both reduced the immediate need for such hedges 
key assumptions related to the eve treatment of noncontractual deposits are subject to frequent and careful management review 
these assumptions are revised as necessary to reflect current market conditions  business trends and product manager expectations 
it should be emphasized that valuation analysis focuses on the long term economic value of the corporation s future cash flows 
for some financial instruments  the adverse impact of current movements in interest rates on expected future cash flows must be recognized immediately 
for example  if interest rates decline and the related hedge is not effective  thereby reducing estimated future fee income from msrs such that the estimated economic value of the msrs falls below book value  an immediate impairment charge is required 
in contrast  for other financial instruments  such as fixed rate investment securities  the beneficial impact of a decline in interest rates on future income is unrecognized unless the instruments are sold 
as a result of such accounting requirements  a portion of the eve exposure attributable to msrs could materially impact earnings within the next months under certain extreme scenarios involving changes in market spreads  a decline in implied option volatilities  and or a greater than anticipated increase in prepayments 
off balance sheet interest rate instruments used to manage net interest income are designated as hedges of specific assets and liabilities 
accrual accounting is applied to these hedges  and the income or expense is recorded in the same category as that of the related balance sheet item 
the periodic net settlement of the interest rate risk management instruments is recorded as an adjustment to net interest income 
as of december   the corporation had net deferred income of million relating to terminated interest rate swap contracts  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the underlying terminated interest rate contracts of approximately years 
the interest rate instruments used to manage potential impairment of msrs are designated as hedges of the msrs 
changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the msrs and related hedges 
during  net hedge losses of million were deferred and recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the msrs and related hedges 
at december   the carrying value and fair value of the corporation s msrs were billion and billion  respectively 
in connection with the corporation s management of its msr hedge program  the corporation terminated in notional amounts billion of interest rate floor and option on swap agreements and billion of call options purchased  and added billion and billion of interest rate floor and option on swap agreements and call options purchased  respectively  during additionally  the corporation added billion of interest rate cap and cap corridors and billion of interest rate swap contracts  and terminated billion and billion  respectively  of these instruments during these risk management activities do not completely eliminate interest rate risk in the msrs 
the msr hedges utilized were indexed to treasury rates  swap rates and mortgage rates 
treasury rates and swap rates may not move in tandem with mortgage interest rates 
in addition  as mortgage interest rates change  actual prepayments may not respond exactly as anticipated 
other pricing factors  such as the implied volatility of market yields  may affect the value of the option hedges without similarly impacting the msrs 
therefore  the corporation s hedging activity may not be sufficient to eliminate prepayment and other market risk completely in all interest rate scenarios 
non us dollar denominated risk the corporation s non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
the majority of the corporation s non us dollar denominated interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure stems from its operations in latin america  primarily argentina and brazil 
the argentine interest rate risk position reflects repricing and or maturity mismatches arising primarily from the corporation s corporate lending and retail businesses 
the interest rate risk related to these positions is managed using simulation and valuation analyses much like those used to manage the domestic interest rate risk position 
at december   the net interest income and economic value exposures of the corporation s argentine non us dollar interest rate risk positions were approximately million and million  respectively  versus limits of million and million  respectively 
the corporation s brazilian interest rate risk position  which is mostly short term in nature  reflects repricing and or maturity mismatches arising primarily from corporate lending  trade financing and treasury activities 
given the short term nature of those positions and the volatility of the markets  the interest rate risk related to these positions is managed using a value at risk var methodology  which is discussed in the price risk trading activities section 
the var exposure for the corporation s brazilian non us dollar denominated interest rate risk positions was approximately million at december   versus a limit of million 
when deemed appropriate  the corporation will take positions in certain currencies with the intention of taking advantage of movements in currency and interest rates 
the corporation takes currency positions by funding local currency assets with dollars or by funding dollar assets with local currency liabilities 
currency positions expose the corporation to gains or losses that depend on the relationship between currency price movements and interest rate differentials 
these positions are subject to limits established by alcco 
the majority of the corporation s non trading foreign exchange risk is generated by its operations in argentina and brazil 
the following table represents the corporation s currency positions in argentina and brazil for and currency positions december in millions year end average year end average argentina a brazil b a positions represent local currency assets funded by us dollars for both periods presented

price risk trading activities price risk is the risk of loss of earnings arising from adverse changes in the value of trading portfolios of financial instruments 
the corporation s price risk arises from market making  dealing and position taking in interest rate  currency exchange rate  equity and precious metals markets 
this exposure mainly arises in the normal course of the corporation s business as a financial intermediary 
the corporation enters into interest rate  currency exchange rate and precious metals contracts  primarily to satisfy the investment and risk management needs of its customers 
equity positions result mainly from the corporation s market making and underwriting activities 
in addition  the corporation takes certain proprietary trading positions  including positions in high yield and emerging markets fixed income securities  local currency debt and equity securities  and related derivatives 
the corporation expects these proprietary trading positions to benefit from short term movements in the prices of securities and from perceived inefficiencies among the prices of various securities issued by the same country or entity 
domestic fixed income trading activities also include position taking in us treasury and us government agency securities 
the chart below presents the daily trading related revenues  in millions of dollars  that resulted from the corporation s combined trading activities 
the corporation has implemented a price risk management process to limit the volatility of these daily earnings results 
graphic omitted bar chart representation of daily trading related revenues revenues number of days in millions alcco and the market risk committee the mrc have responsibility for implementing the board s policies governing price risk management 
alcco issues overall strategic direction to specify the extent of utilization for board approved risk limits  based upon the corporation s willingness to accept price risk 
the mrc has responsibility for allocating the overall price risk limits set by alcco to the corporation s risk taking activities 
the corporation uses a var methodology  based on industry standard risk measurement techniques  to measure the overall price risk inherent in its trading activities 
the system draws on historical and current market data to estimate potential market volatility  and measures the risk to earnings at a confidence level  which means that the corporation expects daily results to exceed the potential loss as calculated by var only occasionally ie  no more than one time for at least trading days 
the var methodology requires a number of other key assumptions  including those related to the holding period  the impact of credit spread risk  and the treatment of event risk 
during  the corporation enhanced its processes for price risk measurement and monitoring against approved limits 
the corporation s aggregate daily exposure averaged million during  and million during at year end  total var usage measured million  well within the million limit allocated by the mrc 
during  the majority of the price risk in the corporation s trading operations arose from interest rate and equity components 
interest rate risk  which includes directional and spread components  averaged approximately million  or of total trading var  and remained roughly constant throughout the year 
this risk component arises primarily from trading activity in the domestic high yield market and the argentinean and brazilian sovereign and high end corporate bond markets 
the contribution to the corporation s var from equity trading activities in its robertson stephens and quick reilly units rose throughout the year to of total trading var at year end  a level comparable to the interest rate risk component 
the individual activities comprising this risk type include the second largest nyse specialist firm  nasdaq market making  a convertible bond trading and underwriting business and an equity derivatives business 
foreign exchange risk remained modest throughout  and comprised about of the corporation s total trading var at year end 
the majority of this risk arises from the corporation s argentinean and brazilian operations 
commodity risk  arising from a small precious metals activity supporting a vibrant precious metals lending business  is not significant

total risk the chart below presents the corporation s daily aggregate trading var and its daily aggregate trading related revenues 
trading related revenues include both the amounts recorded as trading profits and commissions and foreign exchange revenue  both components of capital markets revenue  as well as net interest income from these trading positions 
graphic omitted scatter graph of daily trading related revenues and var measures the daily trading related revenues include daily trading profits and commissions and foreign exchange revenues  as well as daily trading related net interest income 
during  the daily trading related revenues ranged from losses of million per day to profits of million per day 
var includes all trading portfolios and the foreign exchange portfolio 
during  var ranged from million per day to million per day 
in addition to the var framework  the corporation employs other risk measurement tools to evaluate and control price risk 
these tools include cumulative loss limits and overall portfolio size limits  as well as regular stress tests and scenario analyses 
stress testing employs a var calculation based on a ten standard deviation change in the prices of underlying risk factors 
scenario analyses apply actual market conditions experienced in the past against current positions 
while the var framework and the additional risk measurement tools effectively ensure exposures remain within the corporation s expressed tolerance for price risk  they do not guarantee the avoidance of trading losses during periods of extreme volatility 
liquidity risk the objective of liquidity risk management is to assure the ability of the corporation and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations are the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity is achieved by the maintenance of a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell marketable securities  committed lines of credit and access to capital markets 
liquidity may also be enhanced through the securitization of commercial and consumer receivables 
liquidity is measured and monitored daily  allowing management to better understand and react to balance sheet trends 
alcco is responsible for implementing the board s policies and guidelines governing liquidity 
us dollar liquidity management is centralized in boston  with overseas operations managing their own local currency liquidity requirements 
liquidity at the bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  core deposits and wholesale funds 
diversification of liquidity sources by maturity  market  product and funds provider are mandated through alcco guidelines 
the corporation s banking subsidiaries routinely model liquidity under three economic scenarios  two of which involve increasing levels of economic difficulty and financial market strain 
management also maintains a detailed contingency liquidity plan designed to respond to an overall decline in the condition of the banking industry or a problem specific to the corporation 
the strength of the corporation s liquidity position is its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources in the capital markets  as well as from direct customer contacts 
wholesale funding sources include large certificates of deposit  foreign branch deposits  federal funds  collateralized borrowings and a billion bank note program 
another important source of bank funding is the securitization market 
during  billion of c i loans  million of credit card receivables and million of home equity loans were securitized 
additionally  the corporation s banking subsidiaries accessed the euro market 
the primary sources of liquidity for the parent company are interest and dividends from subsidiaries  committed lines of credit and access to the money and capital markets 
dividends from banking subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and retained earnings 
the corporation s subsidiaries rely on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings  short term high quality liquid assets  and  in the case of non banking subsidiaries  funds from the parent company 
at december   the corporation s parent company had commercial paper outstanding of billion  compared with billion at december  the corporation s parent company had excess funds at december  of billion compared to billion at december  the corporation has backup lines of credit totaling billion to ensure funding is not interrupted if commercial paper is not available

management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities to customers and debt holders 
the effect of maturing liabilities is discussed in the asset liability management section 
capital management a financial institution s capital serves to support asset growth and provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
the corporation strives to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with its risk profile  on which an attractive return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while serving depositors  creditors and regulatory needs 
in determining optimal capital levels  the corporation also considers the capital levels of its peers and the evaluations of the major rating agencies that assign ratings to the corporation s public debt 
common equity represents the stockholders investment in the corporation 
in addition to common equity  regulatory capital includes  within certain limits  preferred stock  subordinated debt and credit loss reserves 
in blending the requirements of each of these constituencies  the corporation has established target capital ranges that it believes will provide for management flexibility and the deployment of capital in an optimally efficient and profitable manner 
these targets are reviewed periodically relative to the corporation s risk profile and prevailing economic conditions 
on january   the corporation redeemed its cumulative preferred stock at its aggregate carrying value of million 
the corporation strives to maintain regulatory capital at approximately 
above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution  as defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
to be categorized as well capitalized  the corporation s banking subsidiaries must maintain a risk based total capital ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least  and not be subject to a written agreement  order or capital directive with regulators 
in addition  the corporation currently has a tangible common equity to assets ratio target range of and a total equity to assets ratio target range of 
capital ratios december risk adjusted assets in millions   tier risk based capital ratio minimum total risk based capital ratio minimum leverage ratio a common equity to assets ratio total equity to assets ratio tangible common equity to assets ratio tangible total equity to assets ratio a the corporation was subject to a minimum and minimum at december  and  respectively 
at december   the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios  and satisfied the requirements of the well capitalized category established by fdicia 
the corporation s risk based capital ratios decreased compared with december   reflecting the impact of the merger and restructuring related charges and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of  this decrease is expected to be offset in as a result of the anticipated gain on the divestiture of branches  the related reduction in asset levels and the strong internal generation of capital 
excess capital  defined as common equity above the capital target  is available for core business investments and acquisitions 
as registered brokers dealers and member firms of the nyse  certain subsidiaries of the corporation are subject to rules of both the sec and the nyse 
these rules require members to maintain minimum levels of net capital  as defined  and may restrict a member from expanding its business and declaring dividends as its net capital approaches specified levels 
at december   these subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of approximately million  which exceeded aggregate minimum net capital requirements by approximately million

the provision for credit losses was million in compared with million in  with the increase due principally to increased credit card charge offs  as a result of higher levels of credit card receivables from the acquisitions of various credit card portfolios  expansion in latin america and the charge off of loans in the corporation s international private bank 
noninterest income increased over billion to billion in increases were noted in nearly all core revenue categories including banking fees and commissions  investment services  capital markets and credit cards 
these increases reflect growth in core businesses  the impact of acquisitions  and a strong domestic equity market 
noninterest expense totaled billion in  compared with billion in this increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned acquisitions  branch expansions in argentina and brazil and other initiatives in the corporation s key businesses 
total loans at december  were billion  compared with billion at december  the increase was attributable to strong loan growth in the domestic and international c i and lease financing portfolios  as well as higher levels of credit card receivables as a result of various portfolio acquisitions  and was partially offset by a slight decline in the commercial real estate portfolio  as well as the securitization of billion of c i and home equity loans 
total deposits increased billion to billion at december  the increase was due principally to a billion increase in domestic money market deposits as a result of promotional rates aimed at attracting new sources of funds  as well as increased international deposits 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in domestic regular savings and now deposits 
long term debt increased billion to billion as a result of funding both acquisitions and balance sheet growth 
recent accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes comprehensive accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the standard requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
however  the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge 
if the derivative instrument does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value are reported in earnings when they occur 
if the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge  the accounting treatment varies based on the type of risk being hedged 
in october  the fasb formed a group of outside experts to assist with interpretation issues raised by companies 
this derivatives implementation group the dig has addressed over issues with the fasb and is scheduled to meet through december  the corporation intends to adopt sfas no 
as of january  the adoption of this standard may cause volatility in both the income statement as well as the equity section of the balance sheet 
the impact of this statement cannot be currently estimated and will be dependent upon the fair value  nature and purpose of the derivative instruments held by the corporation as of january item a
