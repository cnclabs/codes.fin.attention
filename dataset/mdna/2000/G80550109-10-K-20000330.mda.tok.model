item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  and for the period from inception february  to december  overview our principal asset is a interest before participation by ecopetrol in the dindal and rio seco association contracts 
as of december   ryder scott company petroleum consultants estimated total proved recoverable reserves for the guaduas field of million barrels of oil  of which million barrels of oil were attributable to our interest 
our current plans for the use of available capital are set forth under business our current strategy 
whether we can achieve our objectives on schedule and with our existing capital resources depends on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
factors include timely environmental permitting  securing pipeline rights of way  obtaining ecopetrol s agreement to commerciality under the association contracts  timely payments by the association contract partners of their share of these costs and the market price of oil field equipment and services 
if we experience delays or cost overruns  which are considered possible  we will seek other sources of financing  including project financing  industry joint ventures or arrangements with industry service companies  commercial bank borrowings and traditional debt and equity financing 
another alternative is the formation of a separate company to construct the guaduas pipeline 
this company would be owned and financed by third parties and we would likely have little or no equity in it 
this would require us to pay only a per barrel tariff on the oil transported through the pipeline and none of the capital expenditures that are currently budgeted by us for the construction of the pipeline 
in review in our december  k  we outlined our plan for developing the guaduas field during and specifically  we estimated that we would commence field production with increment i  the trucking production scenario  in early at production rates between  bbls d to  bbls d 
we also estimated that we would start increment ii  the early pipeline production scenario  by year end as we stated in our k  meeting these deadlines depended on three contingencies receiving a global operating license from the colombian ministry of environment  permitting development activity within the dindal and rio seco association contract areas  receiving an environmental pipeline permit to construct the mile pipeline necessary for completion of increment ii  and approval of commerciality by ecopetrol by december the negotiations with ecopetrol for an agreement that would lead to a final decision on commerciality lasted almost months 
originally  we anticipated concluding negotiations with ecopetrol in june and establishing a date prior to december  by which ecopetrol would be contractually obligated to make a decision on commerciality 
however  the negotiations continued for an additional four months  due principally to factors beyond our control  including a myriad of economic and political factors that inevitably play a role in any negotiations with most foreign governments 
we also conducted the environmental studies that are required to request the global operating license and the environmental pipeline permit from the colombian ministry of environment 
after the agreement was signed on september   we began fulfilling the commitments we made in the agreement  specifically conducting a long term production test  and drilling the el segundo e well to test for a gas gap in the guaduas field 
as part of the long term production test  we shut in the four wells that had been tested to measure the pressure build up of the guaduas field over an extended period of days 
the shut in period ended in late january the drilling and initial test results of the el segundo e were also completed by late january  providing the required data to ecopetrol s technical personnel for its decision on commerciality 
on december   we made a formal application to ecopetrol for the commercial development of the guaduas field 
on february   we filed an addendum to the application 
the long term test production was similar to our increment i trucking production plan and began approximately four months ahead of our early target date for increment i 
after more than four months of production at an average daily rate of  barrels  over  barrels of oil were produced  bringing the total number of barrels produced from the guaduas field to  following the production testing phase  we shut in the field for ongoing pressure testing needed for our reserve calculations and field engineering studies 
now  we are prepared to resume trucking production as soon as ecopetrol approves or rejects our request for commerciality 
we expect the decision as early as april  but ecopetrol has advised us in writing it will be no later than may  based on the new information obtained from drilling the el segundo e and the long term production testing  our independent engineers  the ryder scott company petroleum consultants and servipetrol ltd  studied the data from the guaduas field for a third consecutive year and ryder scott re affirmed its estimates of the guaduas field s oil reserves 
specifically  ryder scott estimated the guaduas field s total proved reserves to be million barrels as of december   a slight decrease from the december  estimate of million and an increase from the december  estimate of million barrels 
the december  estimate of the guaduas field s net reserves to seven seas was million  a slight decrease from the december  estimate of million and an increase from the december  estimate of million barrels 
proved reserves decreased between december  and december   primarily as a result of the disappointing results of the el segundo e well 
preliminary analysis indicates that the well did not encounter the cimarrona reservoir 
despite the decrease in proved reserves  the pre tax net present value of our proved oil reserves  discounted at percent  increased to million in the december  report from million in our december  report due to an increase in oil prices from to per barrel 
go forward strategy as of march   we have not yet received a decision on commerciality  the global operating license or the environmental pipeline permit 
as a result  we will miss our target of late for beginning increment ii  the early pipeline production  which was estimated to provide production ranging from  bbls d to  bbls d 
however  provided ecopetrol approves commerciality prior to may   we receive the global operating license and environmental pipeline permit  and we obtain sufficient financing to pay our share of the costs  we estimate we will commence transporting guaduas field oil production through the pipeline approximately months from the date ecopetrol approves our request for commerciality and we receive the global operating license and environmental permit 
we call this outcome scenario this scenario could cost approximately million  or million net to seven seas 
if ecopetrol does not approve our request for commerciality by may   our next step will be to decide  together with our association contract partners  if we want to develop the guaduas field as originally proposed on a sole risk basis 
this decision will depend on whether we can timely meet the increased capital requirements for the sole risk development of the guaduas field and pipeline 
this sole risk outcome is scenario under the sole risk provision  the associates would be permitted to develop the guaduas field as proposed in our request for commerciality by paying of the development costs  thereby retaining all revenues from production after the royalty reduction 
ecopetrol can start to participate at any time subject to our right to reimbursement of prior costs 
a decision to proceed on a sole risk basis could cost approximately million  or million net to seven seas 
if ecopetrol rejects our request for commerciality and we decide not to proceed with the development on a sole risk basis  we expect to pursue scenario in which we would negotiate a modified commerciality decision with ecopetrol 
a modified commerciality plan would likely consist of a development plan similar to that of increment i trucking  as described in our form k  and would result in a postponement of a final decision on the construction of a pipeline 
this scenario will likely produce cash flow for seven seas that  depending on oil prices  will fund our annual overhead 
if we proceed under this scenario  our immediate priority would be to use our existing cash resources to test the underlying formations of the subthrust dindal structure and to further explore the rio seco and dindal association contract areas to increase the reserves of the shallow guaduas field 
this strategy can possibly be funded with our existing cash resources 
however  under this scenario  we would immediately seek additional financing as discussed below in financing the go forward strategies 
some of the advantages to scenario that would offset the cost of delay in pipeline production are due to our limited cash resources  it is not likely that we would be able to develop the guaduas field as we proposed in our request for commerciality ie construct a pipeline and facilities for  to  bbls d production and pursue an aggressive exploration strategy at the same time 
under scenario  we would be able to test the full potential of the rio seco and dindal association contract areas sooner than under scenarios and if any of the exploration wells that are scheduled to be drilled by sipetrol and texaco on areas adjacent to those of the rio seco and dindal association contracts and or either of our two exploration wells the subthrust and tres pasos wells we would drill under this scenario are successful  we  and possibly sipetrol and texaco and their partners  would be able to build a pipeline better suited to the overall production capacity of the reserves established in the immediate region 
financing the go forward strategies if we spend our available capital resources as contemplated under scenario  we will have to seek additional financing for future operations including exploratory drilling to test the deeper formations of the subthrust structure and extend the area of the guaduas field 
production of  bbls d to  bbls d will require additional production facilities  construction of a pipeline and the expansion of oil production through successful development drilling of the shallow cimarrona reservoir 
we estimate these costs to be approximately million  million net to seven seas if ecopetrol approves commerciality 
possible additional sources of financing for our commerciality strategy are project financing of the pipeline  industry joint ventures or other similar arrangements with industry service companies  commercial bank borrowing  and debt and equity financing 
under the terms of our million senior notes  we are allowed to incur an additional million of general indebtedness that can be senior to our senior notes 
we could  for example  secure this additional indebtedness with our existing proved reserves 
we are also allowed to borrow an additional million for project financing such as for the pipeline and production facilities 
in short  we are permitted to borrow up to million that can be senior to our outstanding million senior notes 
because our proved oil reserves have a net present value  discounted at  of million  we believe we can secure financing if ecopetrol approves our request for commerciality 
if ecopetrol does not approve our request for commerciality  it will be difficult  but not impossible  for us to proceed sole risk 
this would require approximately million to finance our net costs 
however  if we proceed with scenario  a modified commerciality plan  and proceed to truck oil production  our near term financial needs will decrease 
in this event  we believe we can secure additional financing of approximately million to million 
this smaller amount will allow us to accelerate our plans to test the deeper subthrust dindal formations and further explore and delineate the shallow exploration plans 
summary in summary  subject to obtaining the necessary financing  we believe that we will make substantial progress during the year toward accomplishing one of our previously mentioned scenarios in the event that ecopetrol approves our commerciality request  we estimate we can achieve the early pipeline production of  to  bbls d within approximately months from the date ecopetrol approves our commerciality request  we receive the global operating license and environment pipeline permit  and secure financing 
in the event that ecopetrol rejects our request for commerciality  we intend to proceed with one of the following two scenarios provided we can secure financing timely  we will proceed to develop the guaduas field as originally planned on a sole risk basis  and estimate that we can achieve pipeline production of between  bbls d to  bbls d within approximately months from the date ecopetrol rejects our commerciality request  we receive the global operating license and environmental pipeline permit  and secure such financing  or negotiate a modified commerciality plan whereby we proceed with trucking production and postpone a final decision on the construction of a pipeline 
under this scenario  we would accelerate our plans to test the deeper subthrust dindal formations and further explore and delineate the shallow guaduas field 
we cannot be certain that additional sources of financing will be available when needed or will be available on acceptable terms 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we had working capital  net of restricted investments  of million  including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  our non discretionary capital commitments for the remainder of are approximately million 
we also plan to use our available cash as set forth under business our current strategy 
we also plan to conduct seismic or substitute operations on the rosablanca and montecristo blocks during at a net cost of million 
see also financing the go forward strategies 
equity and financing activities as of march   we had  common shares  no par value  outstanding  of which none are restricted 
at december   we had outstanding million of senior notes due may  our activities from inception through december  were funded primarily by the proceeds from private placements of our securities  including our common shares  warrants and notes  resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of million 
recent transactions include exchangeable notes 
in august  we issued million of exchangeable notes in a private transaction with institutional and accredited investors 
the exchangeable notes accrued interest at a rate of per annum and were payable on december and june in each year 
the exchangeable notes were scheduled to mature on august  convertible debentures 
the exchangeable notes were exchanged for a like principal amount of convertible debentures on august  the convertible debentures were converted on august  into units consisting of  common shares and warrants exercisable for  common shares 
purchase warrants 
on february   purchase warrants for million of our common shares expired without exercise 
we received proceeds of million from the exercise of  warrants 
these purchase warrants had been issued in association with the exchange and conversion of our previously outstanding million issue of exchangeable notes 
senior notes 
in may  we completed the offering of million of senior notes due may  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds was held in a separate account or in escrow to provide for the first three years of interest payable under the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
the escrow account is sufficient to pay interest through may the senior notes mature on may  the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may   at the prescribed redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption 
at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed with a portion of the net proceeds of an equity or strategic investor offering  provided that at least of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding immediately after the redemption 
in the event of certain changes affecting withholding taxes applicable to certain payments on the senior notes  the senior notes may be redeemed at our option  in whole but not in part  at any time at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the redemption date 
upon the occurrence of a change of control unless we redeem the senior notes as provided in below  we will be required to offer to purchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of purchase  and we will have the option  at any time prior to may   to redeem the senior notes  in whole but not in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest  liquidated damages and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption 
the senior notes are senior obligations of seven seas and are ranked equally in right and priority of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
capital spending from inception through december   we had cash expenditures for the exploration of oil and gas properties of million 
our estimated capital expenditures assume that each of the associates in the association contracts approves and pays its proportionate share of capital expenditures 
accounting policies and development stage accounting the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
our exploration and development activities have not generated a substantial amount of revenue  thus requiring the financial statements to be presented as a development stage enterprise 
accumulated losses are presented on the balance sheet as deficit accumulated during the development stage 
the income statement presents revenues and expenses for each period presented and also a cumulative total of both amounts from our inception 
period to period comparisons of such results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
in this regard  future results of seven seas will be highly dependent upon the success of our guaduas field operations 
the statement of cash flows shows inflows and outflows for each period presented and from our inception 
in addition  the notes to consolidated financial statements are required to identify the enterprise as development stage 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized in separate cost centers for each country 
such capitalized costs include contract and concession acquisition  geological  geophysical and other exploration work  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  constructing production facilities and pipelines  and other related costs 
no general and administrative costs were capitalized during  and we capitalized interest of million and million in and  respectively 
the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in each cost center are amortized on the composite units of production method based on future gross revenues from proved reserves 
sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are normally accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs 
gain or loss is not recognized in income unless a significant portion of a cost center s reserves are involved 
capitalized costs associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until it is determined whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties or until the value of the properties is impaired 
if the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in a cost center exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves in the cost center and the lower of cost or fair value of properties not being amortized  both adjusted for income tax effects  such excess is charged to expense 
results of development stage operations years ended december   and revenues from oil sales were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
lease operating expenses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the company tested four wells in  none in and four wells in the costs related to the long term production testing of the tres pasos w horizontal  the el segundo s  the tres pasos e  and the el segundo n wells 
the oil and gas operating expenses represent such costs as tank rentals and other miscellaneous fixed costs 
oil production in colombia net to us  including minority interest through june  of  barrels   barrels  and  barrels in  and  respectively  pertaining solely to our share of oil produced from production testing  was sold to refinerie del nare or ecopetrol at an average price of per barrel in  per barrel in  and per barrel in the four wells production tested in were tested at long durations to acquire additional reservoir data 
interest income was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was the consequence of lower cash and investment balances resulting from the use of funds from the issuance of the senior notes in may the increase from to was the consequence of higher cash and investment balances resulting from the issuance of the senior notes in may general and administrative costs were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the costs incurred during included million relating to costs incurred conducting feasibility studies for the proposed construction of pipeline and production facilities and other development activities in colombia 
the costs incurred during included approximately million of severance and million of related compensation costs associated with the resignation of former officers 
depletion  depreciation and amortization was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization of costs incurred on the issue of the senior notes in may in addition  we began recording depletion of our proved oil and gas property in the fourth quarter of  which amounted to million in the increase from to was primarily attributable to the amortization of costs incurred on the issue of the senior notes in may and the exchangeable notes in august as required under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized costs are limited to the sum of the present value of future net revenues  using current unescalated pricing and discounted at per annum from proved reserves and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unevaluated properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
there was no write down in at december   we recognized a non cash write down of oil and gas properties in the amount of million pre tax or million after tax pursuant to this ceiling limitation 
the write down was primarily the result of the decline in crude oil prices and the impairment of unevaluated properties due primarily to the failure of five non commercial exploratory wells 
seven seas incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the loss includes a non cash write down of million pre tax 
the write down of oil and gas properties reduced the temporary differences included in deferred tax liabilities resulting in an income tax benefit of million and a write down after taxes of million 
the company s board of directors reduced in size over the past year due to the resignations of mr 
williamson and mr 
scarlett in april  mr 
daily and mr 
kerr in january  and mr 
cross in february these resignations have not had and will not have an impact on the on going operations of the company 
taxes our net income  as defined under colombian law  from colombian sources is subject to colombian corporate income tax at a rate of 
an additional remittance tax is imposed upon remittance of profits abroad at a rate of 
the company is also subject to income taxes in canada and the united states  where the statutory rates were and respectively 
the company did not record any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for due principally to a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards 
in  the company released the valuation allowance attributable to us net operating loss carryforwards  resulting in a deferred tax benefit of million  net of current us tax expense of  the company had united states income tax expense of million in year disclosure the year issue is a general phrase used to refer to certain business implications of the arrival of the year in simple terms  on january   all hardware and software systems which use the two digit year convention could have failed completely or created erroneous data as a result of the system failing to recognize the two digit internal date as representing the year we have not experienced any material year compliance problems in our internal systems and operations 
we have a limited operating history and are engaged solely in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in colombia 
as such  we engage in few transactions and have minimum reliance on the hardware and software systems of third parties 
further  our hardware and software systems are relatively new and widely utilized 
one of the next phases in the development of the guaduas field is the transportation and marketing of crude oil to be produced from our properties 
we retained brown root energy services and technivance brown root sa to conduct planning and engineering studies for the pipeline and associated compression facilities from the guaduas field 
we intend for the technology employed in the delivery systems to be year compliant 
we have also asked these consultants to review any year risks associated with the planned interconnection of our delivery systems with other pipelines  and are reviewing the oleoducto alto magdelena delivery systems in conjunction with our current negotiations with the operator of that pipeline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity risk we have faced minimal risk from commodity pricing because of the small amounts of oil and gas produced to date 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing are expected to be minor until such time as we produce commercial quantities of oil and gas 
interest rate risk we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of a fixed interest rate on the million senior notes 
we currently have no open interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures 
however  because predominately all transactions in our existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations 
exposure from transactions in currencies other than the us dollars is not material
