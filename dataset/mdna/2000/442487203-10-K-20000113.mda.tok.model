item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  seasonal increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the repurchase of common stock  the redemption of subordinated indebtedness  and the acquisition of two homebuilding companies 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the issuance of  senior notes  the revolving credit facility  the sale of commercial facilities  financial service income  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and depreciation and impairment losses 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal  inventory levels increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as inventory levels increase 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels 
as mortgage loans increase  cash flow from operations decreases 
conversely  as such loans decrease  cash flow from operations increases 
depreciation and impairment losses always increase cash flow from operating activities since they are non cash charges to operations 
we expect to be in an expansion mode in fiscal as a result  we expect cash flow from operations to be less than net income in fiscal in december the board of directors increased the stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
this authorization expires on december  as of october    shares were repurchased under this program of which  were repurchased during the year ended october  our bank borrowings are made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement the agreement which provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of up to  through july interest is payable monthly and at various rates of either the prime rate or libor plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
as of october   borrowings under the agreement were  the subordinated indebtedness issued by us and outstanding as of october  was  subordinated notes due june on may   we issued  senior notes due in april on june   we redeemed the remaining  principal amount subordinated notes due april the early retirement of these notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  the remaining proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility to zero at that time and for general corporate purposes 
our mortgage banking subsidiary borrows under a  bank warehousing arrangement which expires in june other finance subsidiaries formerly borrowed from a multi builder owned financial corporation and a builder owned financial corporation to finance mortgage backed securities but in fiscal decided to cease further borrowing from multi builder and builder owned financial corporations 
these non recourse borrowings have been generally secured by mortgage loans originated by one of our subsidiaries 
as of october   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such borrowings was  the book value of our inventories  rental condominiums  and commercial properties completed and under development amounted to the following october  october  residential real estate inventory   senior residential rental property   total residential real estate   commercial properties   combined total   total residential real estate increased  from october  to october  as a result of an inventory increase of  less depreciation of senior residential rental property 
the increase in residential real estate inventory was primarily due to the acquisition of two homebuilding companies during the quarter ended october  and increases in california where we expect to significantly grow our business in fiscal these increases were offset by a decrease in our northeast region where delivery of homes is expected to decrease in fiscal residential homes under construction or completed and included in residential real estate inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most residential real estate  completed or under development  is financed through our line of credit  senior notes and subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of a small option fee and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is kept to a minimum

at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we announced we were planning an orderly exit from the business of owning investment properties 
during fiscal and  we sold all our commercial facilities and a owned partnership sold its retail center 
during fiscal we sold three land parcels

collateral mortgage financing collateral for bonds payable consists of collateralized mortgages receivable which are pledged against non recourse collateralized mortgage obligations 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential mortgages receivable of which  and  at october  and october   respectively  are being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the balance of mortgage loans held for sale are being held as an investment 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
results of operations our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in our northeast region comprised primarily of new jersey  southern new york state  and eastern pennsylvania  in southeastern florida  north carolina  metro d 
c 
northern virginia  southern california  texas and poland 
our texas operations are the result of the acquisition of a texas homebuilder on october  in addition  we had developed and operated commercial properties as long term investments in new jersey  and  to a lesser extent  florida  but have exited this business see investment properties below 
during the years ended october    and  our northeast region  california division and north carolina division housing operations consistently produced operating profits 
in fiscal  our metro dc division and texas acquisition also produced profits 
in and  financial services operations were profitable 
in addition  in and we earned profits from the liquidation of commercial properties 
these profits have been reduced by net losses from our other housing divisions  corporate overhead  the writedown of certain residential inventories and commercial properties to their estimated fair value and the write off of optioned properties and related approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note 
prior to fiscal  our first two quarters produced the least amount of deliveries for the year and the fourth quarter produced the most deliveries for the year  sometimes in excess of of total homes delivered 
in fiscal management made a concerted effort to change this trend using new management tools to focus on delivery evenness and through a new quarterly bonus incentive plan 
the percentage distribution of deliveries for the last three years is as follows quarter ended january april july october total during the year ended october  a higher percentage was delivered in the fourth quarter due to the acquisition of two homebuilding companies 
in fiscal we expect a higher percentage of deliveries later in the fiscal year resulting from the projected flow of deliveries from recent homebuilding company acquisitions and the timing of community grand openings in our northeast region and california division 
total revenues compared to the same prior period  revenues increased decreased as follows year ended october october october dollars in thousands homebuilding sale of homes    land sales and other revenues    financial services   investment properties    collateralized mortgage financing  total change    percent change homebuilding compared to the same prior period  housing revenues increased million or for the year ended october   after increasing million or for the year ended october   and decreasing million or for the year ended october  housing revenues are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession have been transferred to the buyer

the increase in average sales prices during the year ended october  is primarily due to the increases in all markets except metro d 
c 
the increased average sales prices in the northeast region and north carolina were primarily attributed to the rise in base home prices and the sale of more decorator and structural options 
in florida  average sales prices increased as a result of fewer communities  all of which are higher priced single family developments 
in metro dc  average sales prices decreased because of a change in product mix to smaller single family homes 
in california  sales prices increased due to a change in product mix to larger  more expensive homes 
the decrease in homes delivered was primarily due to significant decreases in the northeast region and florida while the other divisions increased deliveries slightly 
the decrease in the northeast region was attributable to fewer communities open for sale 
we expect the northeast region to stay at roughly the  home level in fiscal and then increase in fiscal due to an increase of active selling communities 
in florida  due to operating losses we decided to cut back operations in fiscal and have only one active community delivering homes in fiscal all other divisions increased home deliveries in due to the increase in the number of active selling communities 
in fiscal we expect a significant home delivery increase in california 
in addition  consolidated home deliveries will increase in fiscal due to a full year of operations in texas

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these writedowns and writeoffs were incurred primarily because of lower property values  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property  or the decision not to exercise an option 
during the year ended october  we wrote off one residential land option including approval and engineering costs amounting to million 
we did not exercise this option because the community s proforma profitability did not produce an adequate return on investment commensurate with the risk 
in addition  we wrote down one land parcel in florida  one residential community in new york and two residential communities in north carolina 
the florida land parcel was written down based on recent purchase offers 
the communities were written down based on our decision to discontinue selling homes and offer the remaining lots for sale 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss in accordance with fas during the year ended october   we wrote down one florida residential community and one new jersey parcel of land for sale 
in the florida residential community  higher discounts were being offered to speed up sales 
at the new jersey land site  lots were being contracted at prices lower than anticipated 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss in accordance with fas we also wrote off three new jersey residential land options including approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs amounting to million 
we did not exercise these options because of changes in local market conditions and difficulties in obtaining government approvals 
during the year ended october   we wrote down certain residential communities  and wrote off certain residential land options including approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs 
in florida  our return on investment was unsatisfactory 
as a result  we established a goal to reduce our investment in florida by million 
to do so on an accelerated basis  we reduced prices and offered pricing concessions in all florida residential communities 
we also decided to sell all inactive properties in florida 
in the northeast region  we changed the product type to be constructed on a parcel of land we own 
in an active community in the northeast region  we incurred unforeseen development costs 
also in the northeast  we decided to sell an optioned property instead of developing it 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in fair values below carrying amounts and  in accordance with fas  we recorded an impairment loss on the related inventories 
at october   residential inventories were reduced million to reduce such inventories to estimated fair value 
the northeast region also wrote off costs associated with three optioned properties and related approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs amounting to million 
in two cases  we decided not to exercise the option due to environmental problems 
the third option was not exercised because the community s proforma profitability did not produce an adequate return on investment commensurate with the risk 
cost of sales includes expenses for housing and land and lot sales 
a breakout of such expenses for housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended october october october dollars in thousands sale of homes    cost of sales    housing gross margin    gross margin percentage cost of sales expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues are presented below year ended october october october sale of homes cost of sales housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales gross margin percentage we sell a variety of home types in various local communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage increased from the previous year 
this can be attributed to higher gross margins being achieved in each of our markets 
higher gross margins are primarily attributed to positive effects from process redesign and quality programs that reduced the housing and land development costs  selective price increases or reduced selling incentives in our stronger markets  and an increased percentage of deliveries from the better performing communities 
another factor affecting the gross margin percentage is in the northeast region gross margin percentages are higher compared to our other markets 
in  the gross margin was negatively affected by a lower percentage of housing revenues from the northeast region amounting to in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal we expect margins to remain the same or decrease slightly 
this is primarily the result of a higher percentage of deliveries coming from outside the northeast region where margins are historically lower 
during the year ended october   gross margins increased in all our markets compared to the prior year except florida 
the reasons for the increase in are the same as above for in addition  deliveries increased in the northeast region to compared to the prior year of 
selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  which had decreased from for the year ended october  the dollar amount of selling and general expenses has increased the last two years to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  which increased from million for the previous year 
the overall percentage and dollar increases in such expenses in are attributable to increases in all our markets but primarily due to fewer deliveries in our northeast region and due to northeast region and california administration cost increases 
the percentage decrease during the year ended october  was due to increased deliveries 
the dollar increase in was due to increased administration and marketing costs 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales  interest income  contract deposit forfeitures  cash discounts  national contract rebates  and corporate owned life insurance benefits 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended october october october in thousands land and lot sales    cost of sales    land and lot sales gross margin  land and lot sales are incidental to our residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  as well as from third parties  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the year ended october  and financial services provided a and million pretax profit  respectively  up from break even in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
our mortgage banking goals are to improve profitability by increasing the capture rate of our homebuyers and expanding our business to include originations from unrelated third parties 
during the years ended october  and  third party loans amounted to and  respectively  of total mortgage closings 
most servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
investment properties investment properties consist of rental properties  property management  and gains or losses from sale of such property 
see capital resources and liquidity for information on our decision to sell our investment properties 
we plan to liquidate all properties except for our senior rentals 
at october   all properties except one small land parcel had been liquidated 
during the year ended october  we sold three land parcels for a total sales price of million and recorded a net loss before income taxes of million 
during the years ended october  and  investment property revenues included a million pretax gain and a million pretax gain  respectively  from the sale of its commercial facilities and land 
investment properties expenses do not include interest expense see interest below 
collateralized mortgage financing in the years prior to february  we pledged mortgage loans originated by our mortgage banking subsidiaries against collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
subsequently  we discontinued our cmo program 
as a result  cmo operations are diminishing as pledged loans are decreasing through principal amortization and loan payoffs  and related bonds are reduced 
in recent years  as a result of bonds becoming callable  we have also sold a portion of our cmo pledged mortgages 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses includes the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
in  the increase was primarily attributed to increased expenditures for long term improvement initiatives 
in  the increase was primarily attributed to increased bonus accruals there were no bonus accruals based on the return on equity incentive program in  increased depreciation from the amortization of capitalized process redesign costs in prior years and increased expenditures for long term improvement initiatives 
our long term improvement initiatives include total quality  process redesign net of capitalized expenses  and training 
such initiatives resulted in additional expenses for the years ended october    and amounting to million  million  and million  respectively 
beginning in fiscal year we will be required to capitalize certain computer software development costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software development for or obtained for internal use 
we have not yet determined the impact on net income in connection with the adoption of sop interest interest expense includes housing  land and lot  and rental properties interest 
interest expense is broken down as follows year ended october october october in thousands sale of homes    land and lot sales  rental properties    total    housing interest as a percentage of sale of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage for the years ended october  and was primarily due to decreased levels of debt during the year compared to the prior year 
this decrease is the result of management s goal to deleverage the company  and debt reductions from cash generated by the liquidation of investment properties and earnings 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations  amortization of senior and subordinated note issuance expenses  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions and corporate owned life insurance loan interest 
total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes amounted to and for the years ended october  and  respectively 
net tax benefits as a percentage of the loss before income taxes amounted to for the year ended october  deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if for some reason the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years to recover the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management is confident such deferred tax assets are recoverable regardless of future income 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
extraordinary loss on june   we redeemed  of our outstanding subordinated notes due at an average price of of par which resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  year issues we have fully implemented a plan to resolve our information technology it and non it system year issues 
we designated a full time year project leader  engaged consultants to review and evaluate our plan  completed the identification of our it and non it noncompliant systems and evaluated subcontractors and suppliers state of readiness 
our plan prioritized our efforts on our software systems and computer hardware equipment 
we believe we have upgraded  fixed or retired of our critical noncompliant systems 
all other it and non it systems are not considered critical to our operations  and if noncapable for year  would only be an inconvenience 
the cost of implementing the plan did not have a material impact on earnings in fiscal and was funded through operations 
we are concerned about the readiness of our subcontractors and suppliers 
we have communicated with of these third parties 
we have been informed that substantially all of the subcontractors and suppliers are year compliant 
any third parties whose lack of readiness as to year issues would have an impact on our operations are being replaced 
in most cases  we use more than one subcontractor and supplier so finding replacements was not difficult 
we believe we have solved all significant year issues 
we do not believe we will have material lost revenues due to the year issues 
based on the above  we did not develop a worst case year scenario 
however  we have a year contingency plan which  if necessary  is ready to implement 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which we sell homes  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on us because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from fnma  fhlmc  gnma securities and private investors 
accordingly the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not hedge interest rate risk other than on mortgage loans using financial instruments 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but this risk is not material
