item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s continuing operations are conducted by kronos in the tio business segment 
as discussed below  average tio selling prices significantly increased in and slightly decreased in compared to the prior year 
kronos operating income increased million in and declined million in gross profit margins were in  in and in many factors influence tio pricing levels  including industry capacity  worldwide demand growth and customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions 
kronos believes that the tio industry has long term growth potential  as discussed in item business industry and competition 
net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income percent change in tio sales volume average selling prices in billing currencies kronos operating income in was lower than  primarily due to lower average tio selling prices and lower production volume  partially offset by higher sales volume and a million currency exchange transaction gain related to certain of the company s short term intercompany cross border financings 
kronos operating income for was higher than due to higher average tio selling prices  partially offset by lower sales volume and million of income from refunds of german trade capital taxes  discussed below 
in billing currency terms  kronos average tio selling prices were lower than in with higher prices in north america offset by lower prices in europe and export markets 
european prices at the end of the year when expressed in us dollars at year end exchange rates were below prices available in the us as a result of the strong us dollar against major european currencies 
pigment prices declined during the first three quarters of  but increased in the fourth quarter as a result of price increases announced by all major producers effective during the fourth quarter 
such price increases began to be phased in during the fourth quarter of and continue to be implemented in the first quarter of kronos recently announced a price increase in europe effective april  the successful implementation of the price increase will depend on market conditions 
average selling prices in the fourth quarter of were lower than the fourth quarter of  lower than the average selling price for full year and higher than the third quarter of selling prices at the end of the fourth quarter were higher than the average for the quarter 
average tio selling prices in were higher than with strong increases in all major regions 
industry wide demand was strong throughout and the first half of  before moderating in the second half of and early demand in the second half of was stronger than comparable periods in both and as a result of  among other things  customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases 
kronos sales volume in the fourth quarter of increased from the fourth quarter of sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was higher than with growth in all major regions 
sales volume in was lower than  reflecting lower sales in asia and latin america 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  and the balance to other regions 
kronos expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  depending primarily upon global economic conditions  and accordingly  the company believes sales volume will approximate levels 
kronos produced at or near full capacity in and  but curtailed production during the first quarter of to manage inventory levels 
as a result  kronos reduced finished goods inventories by approximately  metric tons 
kronos production volume in was lower than and capacity utilization in was compared to full capacity in kronos production volume in is expected to closely match expected sales volume 
kronos believes average tio selling prices in should continue an upward trend as the company expects to continue to phase in announced price increases during should demand in remain strong  additional price increases could be announced later in the company believes that average prices will exceed average prices 
as a result of anticipated higher average prices and its continued focus on controlling costs  kronos expects its operating income will be higher than the extent of this improvement will be determined primarily by the magnitude of realized price increases 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which decreased the company s expenses in both and  kronos cost of sales in was higher than due to higher sales volume and higher unit costs  which resulted primarily from lower production levels 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than primarily due to lower sales volume 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of lower average selling prices and higher unit costs  and decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of increased average selling prices 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which decreased the company s expenses in both and  kronos selling  general and administrative expenses  in absolute dollar amounts  increased in from the previous year due to higher distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes  while expenses  in absolute dollar amounts  were lower than as a result of lower distribution expenses related to lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in and in both and the million of german trade capital tax refunds received in relates to years prior to and includes interest 
the german tax authorities were required to remit refunds based on i court decisions which reduced the trade capital tax base and ii prior agreements between the company and the german tax authorities regarding payment of disputed taxes 
the company has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the us dollar translated value of the company s foreign sales and operating costs is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses 
a significant amount of the company s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
excluding the million gain described above  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted the company s operating expenses and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income comparisons was not significant in or general corporate the following table sets forth certain information regarding general corporate income expense 
years ended december  change in millions securities earnings corporate expenses  net 
interest expense securities earnings fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
average funds invested in were lower than primarily due to the repayment of certain of the company s debt in the last half of average funds invested in were higher than primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of rheox in january the company expects security earnings in will be lower than due to lower average levels of funds available for investment due to debt reduction made during and higher projected expenditures in for dividends  environmental remediation and other corporate purposes 
corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to million of expenses in related to the unsuccessful acquisition of certain tio businesses and assets 
corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to the million noncash charge taken in related to the company s adoption of sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this charge is included in selling  general and administrative expense for in the company s consolidated statements of income 
excluding this charge  corporate expenses  net were slightly lower than due to the recognition of million of income in related to the straight line  five year amortization of million of proceeds received in conjunction with the sale of rheox attributable to a five year agreement by the company not to compete in the rheological products business  partially offset by the aforementioned million expense in in the company recorded million of income related to the amortization of this deferred income 
interest expense interest expense declined in and compared to the respective prior years due to prepayment of the deutsche mark denominated bank credit facility in and prepayments of outstanding indebtedness in  principally the senior secured discount notes  the joint venture term loan and a portion of kronos dm denominated debt 
interest expense in declined compared to principally due to prepayments of this outstanding indebtedness 
assuming no significant change in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to lower levels of outstanding indebtedness and lower margins on variable rate debt 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rates and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s operations are conducted on a worldwide basis and the geographic mix of income can significantly impact the company s effective income tax rate 
in and the company s effective tax rate varied from the normally expected rate due predominantly to the recognition of certain deductible tax attributes which previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
also in and  the company recognized certain one time benefits related to german tax settlements 
in the geographic mix of income  including losses in certain jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate  contributed to the company s effective tax rate varying from a normally expected rate

to the extent that actual developments differ from company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
income tax contingencies certain of the company s tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income tax related items and interest 
certain significant german tax contingencies aggregating an estimated dm million million when resolved through were resolved in the company s favor in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the german government enacted certain income tax law changes that were retroactively effective as of january  based on these changes  the company s ongoing current cash income tax rate in germany increased in during the company received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to the company appealed this assessment and  in february  the fredrikstad city court ruled in favor of the norwegian tax authorities on the primary issue  but asserted that such tax authorities assessment was overstated by nok million million at december  
the tax authorities response to the court s assertion is expected by the end of march the company is considering its appeals options 
during the company was informed by the norwegian tax authorities that additional tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  will likely be proposed for the year on an issue similar to the aforementioned case 
the outcome of the case is dependent on the eventual outcome of the case 
although the company believes that it will ultimately prevail  the company has granted a lien for the tax assessment on its fredrikstad  norway tio plant in favor of the norwegian tax authorities and will be required to grant security on the assessment when received 
no assurance can be given that the company s tax matters will be favorably resolved due to the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
the company believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   the company had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the company operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
the company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which the company believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
environmental matters and litigation in addition to the chemicals business conducted through kronos  the company also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses  and holdings of marketable equity securities including securities issued by valhi and other contran subsidiaries 
the company has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by the company  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant  including sites for which ems has contractually assumed the company s obligation 
the company believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but the company s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
the company is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that the company will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  the company believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
the company has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
the company currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually and in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations as discussed above  the company has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   the company had substantial net assets denominated in the canadian dollar and norwegian kroner  partially offset by a euro denominated net liability 
year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain computer programs that had date sensitive software may have recognized a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
this is generally referred to as the year issue 
over the past few years  the company spent time  effort and money in order to address the year issue in an attempt to ensure that computer systems  both information technology it systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology  and software applications would function properly after december  this process included  among other things  the identification of all systems and applications potentially affected by the year issue  the determination of which systems and applications required remediation and the completion thereof and the testing of systems and applications following remediation for year compliance 
in addition  the company requested confirmation from its major software and hardware vendors  suppliers and customers that they were developing and implementing plans to become  or that they had become  year compliant 
contingency plans were also developed to address potential year issues related to business interruption in the event one or more of the company s internal systems or the systems of third parties upon which it relies ultimately proved not to be year compliant 
as part of these contingency plans  the company temporarily idled its manufacturing facilities shortly before the end of as an added safeguard against unexpected loss of utility service  all of such facilities resumed production shortly after midnight of year end after all of the efforts described above  the company believed that its key systems were year compliant prior to december  as part of its normal business operations  the company had already installed upgraded information systems at certain locations which addressed the year issue 
excluding the cost of the ongoing system upgrades  the amount spent to address the year issue was million million in 
to date in  none of the company s manufacturing facilities have suffered any downtime due to noncompliant systems  nor have any significant problems associated with the year issue been identified in any systems 
the company will continue to monitor its major systems in order to ensure that such systems continue to be year compliant 
however  based primarily upon success to date  the company does not currently expect to experience any significant year issues 
euro currency beginning january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union eu  including germany  belgium  the netherlands and france  adopted a new european currency unit the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the participating countries national currencies remain legal tender as denominations of the euro from january  through january   and the exchange rates between the euro and such national currency units are fixed 
the company conducts substantial operations in europe 
the functional currency of the company s german  belgian  dutch and french operations will convert to the euro from their respective national currencies over a two year period beginning in the company has assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
the euro conversion may impact the company s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both selling prices and purchasing costs and  consequently  favorably or unfavorably impact results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
other the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company in the past has sought  and in the future may seek  to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  the company may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals or other industries 
in the event of any acquisition or joint venture transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing the company s existing debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the company is exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company has not generally entered into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor has the company entered into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading purposes 
the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contracts related to currency exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  or see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings fixed rate and variable rate 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for the company s aggregate indebtedness at december  and at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in euros in and deutsche marks in information shown below for such euro denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using that date s exchange rate of 
euro per us dollar dm per us dollar 
fair value contractual maturity date december  december  n a total in millions fixed rate debt us dollar denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt euro denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate december  total in millions fixed rate debt us dollar denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt dm denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate currency exchange rates the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the european union euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
as described above  at december   the company had million of indebtedness denominated in euros million outstanding denominated in deutsche marks 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million million 
marketable equity security prices the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million and million  respectively 
other the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
