item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we began developing multimedia communication technology in the form of programmable multimedia semiconductors and accompanying software in  and have subsequently become a leading manufacturer of semiconductors for the embedded videoconferencing and videophone markets 
we maintain sales and marketing operations to support our multimedia semiconductor business  but we have focused virtually all of our ongoing research and development efforts on ip telephony products and technologies 
in an effort to expand the available market for our multimedia communication products  and to capitalize on our vertically integrated technology  we began developing low cost consumer videophones and marketing these products to consumers under the viatv brand name in over the next two years  we became a leading manufacturer of consumer videophones 
however  in we determined that a combination of factors including the high cost of maintaining a consumer distribution channel  the slower than expected growth rate of the consumer videophone market  and the low gross margins typical of a consumer electronics product made it unlikely that the consumer videophone business would be profitable in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we announced in april that we would cease production of the viatv product line and withdraw from our viatv distribution channels over the subsequent several quarters  resulting in a charge of million related to the write off of viatv inventories 
by march we had completed the exit from the consumer videophone business and we expect no further revenues from viatv products 
in june  using technology designed for our consumer videophone business  we entered the video monitoring market  focusing on security applications for small businesses 
our first product was the rsm remote surveillance module  which was subsequently replaced with an improved rsm model 
the rsm module enables real time remote video monitoring over pots lines 
its target market is primarily owners of small businesses such as convenience stores and restaurants who need the ability to view their premises from any remote location in the world at any time 
other products in our video monitoring line include the rsm remote surveillance module  which enables real time video monitoring over isdn lines  the rsm expander module  which expands the number of monitoring devices that can attach to the rsm or rsm  and the rsm pc software application  which allows a pc to view the video feed from the rsm until recently  we sold our rsm products to security distributors and dealers in north america and europe 
however  in an effort to align our strategic focus on the ip telephony market  we announced the sale of our entire video monitoring business to interlogix  a leading manufacturer of security equipment  in may we are currently transitioning our video monitoring operations to interlogix and expect no further revenues from this business 
see further discussion under recent events below 
we entered the market for embedded ip telephony products in december with the announcement of our audacity internet telephony processor 
the audacity processor combines ip telephony protocol support with audio compression decompression capability and runs multiple simultaneous ip phone calls on a single integrated circuit 
in april  we announced our netergy media hub formerly known as the symphony module  an integrated system product that is based on the audacity semiconductor and that connects up to four analog telephone lines to an ip network 
in september  we announced our audacity t ip phone processor  which combines all the digital processing required to implement an ip telephone onto a single integrated circuit 
our embedded ip telephony products target oem manufacturers of ip telephony equipment  such as voice enabled cable and dsl modems  as well as ip phones and gateways 
in may  we acquired odisei sa  a privately held developer of ip telephony software based in sophia antipolis  france 
we have leveraged the acquisition of odisei to develop and market ip telephony solutions to service providers such as competitive local exchange carriers clecs and internet service providers isps 
in march the company announced its netergy advanced telephony system ats  an all ip hosted ipbx solution that allows service providers to offer dial tone and advanced private branch exchange pbx services to business customers over any broadband ip connection  including dsl  cable  t e  frame relay and broadband wireless 
the ats makes use of our embedded ip telephony products  including the netergy media hub  semiconductors and embedded ip telephony software 
in march  x announced that it would change its name  subject to shareholder approval  to netergy networks  inc the name change reflects x s strategic transition to the ip telephony market 
recent events on may   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire uforce  inc uforce  a developer of ip based software applications such as voicemail and unified messaging based in montreal  canada  by issuing approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of uforce 
in addition  we will issue common stock options for approximately million shares in exchange for all outstanding uforce stock options 
the transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method 
the acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions  and we anticipate completing the acquisition during our second fiscal quarter ending september  also  on may   the company entered into an agreement with interlogix  inc interlogix whereby the company agreed to sell certain assets and license certain technology related to the company s video monitoring business 
the company is obligated to provide interlogix with future updates and upgrades to the licensed technology 
the assets sold included certain accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment  and intangibles 
interlogix agreed to pay the company million  subject to certain adjustments  for the assets and the associated technology license  which has an initial term of three years 
upon the earlier of six months from the date of the agreement or upon delivery of certain remaining obligations  the company will commence recognition of the resulting net gain over the remaining term of the technology license 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the years ended march   and  as well as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
cost of product revenues is presented as a percentage of product revenues and cost of license and other revenues is presented as a percentage of license and other revenues 
you should read this information in conjunction with our annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report year ended march  in millions product revenues license and other revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of license and other revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net interest expense income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss revenues total revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
total revenues for fiscal were divided among multimedia communication semiconductors million  ip telephony semiconductors  video monitoring systems million  viatv systems million  media hub systems  and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
in fiscal  total revenues were divided among multimedia communication semiconductors million  video monitoring systems million  viatv systems million and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
in fiscal  total revenues were divided among multimedia communication semiconductors million  viatv systems million and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in sales of our viatv systems resulting from our decision in april to discontinue production of viatv products and withdraw from our retail and distribution channels 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in sales of multimedia communication semiconductors and video monitoring systems products 
in fiscal  product revenues decreased by million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in sales of our multimedia communication semiconductors  partially offset by an increase in sales of our viatv and video monitoring system products 
license and other revenues consist of technology licenses  including royalties required under such licenses  and nonrecurring engineering fees for services performed by us for our customers 
license and other revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the million reported in fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in nonrecurring engineering fees 
in fiscal  license and other revenues decreased by million from the million reported in fiscal  due in part to the approximately million paid by com in fiscal for a license to substantially all of the technology underlying our viatvs 
revenues from our ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march   and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  no customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states represented  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
specifically  sales to the asia pacific region represented  and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
our sales to europe represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
cost of revenues and gross profit the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with components  semiconductor wafer fabrication  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with purchasing  scheduling and quality assurance 
gross profit from product revenues was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
product gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross profit and margin from product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to an increase in higher margin multimedia communication semiconductor and video monitoring system revenues as a percentage of total revenues and due to significantly higher gross margins realized on sales of our viatv products as we were able to sell such product at prices higher than previously anticipated 
as discussed above  we recorded a million charge associated with the write off of viatv product inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to our decision to cease production of the viatv product line and withdraw from our distribution channels which adversely impacted our gross margins in fiscal gross profit from license and other revenues  all of which were nonrecurring  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal cost of license and other revenues consisted of personnel and other costs incurred by us to perform certain development work under terms of a non recurring engineering contract with one of our customers 
there can be no assurance that we will receive any revenues from such license and other revenue sources in the future 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including  product mix  the recognition of license and other revenues for which there may be no or little corresponding cost of revenues  product pricing  the allocation between international and domestic sales  the percentage of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
the markets for our products are characterized by falling average selling prices 
we expect that  as a result of competitive pressures and other factors  gross profit as a percentage of revenue for our multimedia communication semiconductor products will likely decrease for the foreseeable future 
because the market is emerging  the average selling price for ip telephony semiconductors is uncertain 
we may not be able to attain average selling prices asps similar to those of our historical videoconferencing semiconductors 
if asps are lower  gross margins will be lower than our historical gross margins  unless costs for ip telephony semiconductors are also proportionately lower 
in the likely event that we encounter significant price competition in the markets for our products  we could be at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
higher research and development expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal were due primarily to increased spending related to netergy ipbx system software development 
significant expenses were also incurred in fiscal related to development efforts associated with the audacity t processor and media hub products 
lower research and development expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal were due to decreases in profit sharing and incentive bonuses  non recurring viatv and video monitoring system design costs  and costs associated with materials and tooling used in prototype builds of our viatv and video monitoring system products 
during fiscal  research and development costs would have been higher  except that certain research and development personnel performed non recurring engineering services under a revenue generating contract 
the costs associated with this contract were included in the cost of license and other revenues 
we expect to continue to allocate substantial resources to research and development 
however  future research and development costs may vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include advertising  sales commissions  trade show and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a million charge recorded as in connection with the sale of million shares of our common stock to stmicroelectronics at per share 
the charge reflects a portion of the discount from the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the agreement 
this increase was offset by lower costs associated with the marketing  advertising and promotion of the viatv product line and lower headcount required to support these activities as we exited from the consumer videophone business 
in fiscal  expenses increased due to costs associated with the marketing  advertising and promotion of our viatv videophone product line  additional headcount required to support these activities  and expenses associated with our implementation of a new enterprise wide database and information management system 
these increases were substantially offset by decreases in profit sharing and incentive bonuses  and commission expenses 
as we introduce and promote new ip telephony products  and attempt to expand distribution channels for such products  future selling  general and administrative costs may vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
see factors that may affect future results potential fluctuations in operating results 
in process research and development and amortization of intangibles in conjunction with the may acquisition of odisei  we recorded intangible assets related to goodwill and workforce that are being amortized on a straight line basis over five and three years  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and workforce charged to operations was  for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  we incurred an in process research and development charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the acquisition of odisei 
other income  net in fiscal  and  other income  net  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in other income  net  in fiscal is due primarily to a million gain realized from the sale of a cost basis equity investment  offset by approximately  of losses realized on the sale of certain of our investments classified as available for sale 
the decrease in other income  net  earned in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances as compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense of  included interest charges associated with the convertible subordinated debentures issued in december  as well as the amortization of the related debt discount and debt issuance costs 
benefit provision for income taxes the provision of  for the year ended march  represents certain foreign taxes 
there was no tax provision for the year ended march  due to the net losses incurred 
the tax benefit for the year ended march  resulted from the reversal of approximately million of our income tax liability in the first quarter of fiscal upon notice from the internal revenue service that it had reversed a previously asserted deficiency related to the taxable year at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation reserve has been recorded at march  year impact we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems or our products relating to their inability to recognize appropriate dates related to the year we are also not aware of any material problems with our clients or vendors 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year issues 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  representing an increase of million from march  we currently have no bank borrowing arrangements 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and a non cash adjustment for a gain on sale of investments  net  of million 
cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  and non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of intangibles of  in process research and development of million  and discount on issuance of common stock of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is attributable to proceeds from the sale of an investment of million  offset by acquisitions of property and equipment of million and cash paid for acquisitions  net  of  cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures of million and sales of the company s common stock totaling million  offset by debt issuance costs of  for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased million 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of  cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and non cash items  including a deferred compensation charge of  and depreciation and amortization of  cash used in investing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of net proceeds from the repayment of stockholders notes receivable and sales of the company s common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  and a  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
cash used in operations was partially offset by net income of million  increases of million in deferred revenue  million in accounts payable   in accrued compensation  and non cash items  including a deferred compensation charge of million and depreciation and amortization of  cash used in investing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
we believe that we will be able to fund planned expenditures and satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from cash flow from operations  if any  and existing cash balances 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not seek to exploit business opportunities that will require us to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources to finance our growth and capital requirements 
in particular  the development and marketing of new products could require a significant commitment of resources  which could in turn require us to obtain additional financing earlier than otherwise expected 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in europe and asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  the vast majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  all of our arrangements with our semiconductor foundry and assembly vendors  and with our primary subcontract manufacturer for our media hub systems  are denominated in us dollars 
we have subsidiaries in europe  and as such we are exposed to market risk from changes in exchange rates 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
