item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales sales increased in fiscal following an decrease in fiscal the current year increase is all domestic 
foreign sales were about even with last year as decreases in the first half of the year  which were the result of the brazil currency devaluation that took place in january  were overcome by increased unit volume 
for the past two years  the strong british pound has been adversely affecting our scottish subsidiary s business both in terms of export pricing and domestic import competition 
the current year increase in domestic sales is substantially due to product mix 
the industrial manufacturing sector where we do most of our business continues flat 
in fiscal  domestic sales were down  reflecting a downturn in the industrial manufacturing sector  and foreign sales were down 
the foreign decrease was due mostly to the devaluation of brazil s currency in january in terms of local currency  foreign sales were down only 
earnings before taxes pretax earnings are down for the current year and were down in fiscal cost of sales was in  in  and in generally  changes in these rates are impacted by the manufacturing efficiencies that are gained or lost as a result of increased or decreased production levels 
during  domestic margins were adversely affected by product mix  lower factory overhead absorption  increased fringe benefit costs  particularly pension  and our data processing conversion 
the strong pound mentioned above has had a significant negative effect on scotland s margins for the past two years 
in brazil  the currency devaluation reduced the absolute amount of pretax profits last year  but its effect on importers with whom we compete has allowed our operation to improve margins in both years 
income taxes the effective tax rate is in compared to in and in tax exempt interest on short term investments in municipal bonds  puerto rico tax incentives and somewhat lower foreign income tax rates all contribute to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the combined us state and federal statutory rate 
nonrecurring permanent differences between book and taxable income for dividends paid from brazil to the us in all years  but particularly in  have reduced their effective tax rate substantially when reported in us dollars 
net earnings as a result of the above  net earnings were down in fiscal when compared to and net earnings were down when compared to market risk market risk is the potential change in a financial instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  and equity and commodity prices

net monetary assets in scotland and brazil total approximately million 
inflation in brazil has decreased to about today from over in when their current economic plan was initiated 
as a consequence  their economy ceased to be considered hyperinflationary as of january a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the aggregate net fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments primarily variable rate investments of  and debt of  at june  or the cash flows or future earnings associated with those financial instruments 
a change in interest rates would impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate investments of approximately  by  liquidity and capital resources years ended in june cash provided by operations    cash used in investing activities    cash used in financing activities    effect of translation rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash   cash flows from operating activities increased million from  and in decreased million from increasing inventories caused the reduced cash flow from operations in the company s investing activities consist mainly of expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the investment of cash not immediately needed for operations 
plant expenditures of million in are less than the million experienced in and the million experienced in  but are more normal than those years  especially  which contained a major building expansion 
cash flows from financing activities are primarily the payment of dividends  which tend to be quite steady from year to year 
the company requires little debt to finance day to day operations and the proceeds from the sale of stock under the various stock plans tend to be used to purchase treasury shares 
treasury share purchases were million in compared to million in and million in the company maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its operations under current business conditions

in addition  forward looking statements may be included in future company documents and in oral statements by company representatives to security analysts and investors 
the company is subject to risks that could cause actual events to vary materially from such forward looking statements  including the following risk factors risks related to technology although the company s strategy includes investment in research and development of new and innovative products to meet technology advances  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in competing against new technologies developed by competitors 
risks related to adoption of the euro the new european currency the euro began being used by the eleven participating european countries january  although the united kingdom is not currently a euro country  the company s scottish subsidiary does a significant amount of business with euro countries 
management believes it has the necessary systems and business processes to deal with what is  in effect  one more foreign currency  but there can be no assurance that there will not be unforeseen economic effects of this change that might affect the company s sales or margins on business done with euro countries 
risks related to foreign operations for the period ended june   approximately a third of the company s sales and net assets relate to foreign operations 
foreign operations are subject to special risks that can materially affect the sales  profits  cash flows  and financial position of the company  including taxes and other restrictions on distributions and payments  currency exchange rate fluctuations  political and economic instability  inflation  minimum capital requirements  and exchange controls 
in particular  the company s brazilian operations  which constitute over half of the company s revenues from foreign operations  can be very volatile  changing from year to year due to the political situation and economy 
as a result  the future performance of the brazilian operations is inherently unpredictable 
see management s discussion sales regarding the recent devaluation of the brazilian currency 
risks related to cyclical nature of the industry the market for most of the company s products is subject to economic conditions affecting the industrial manufacturing sector  including the level of capital spending by industrial companies 
accordingly  economic weakness in the industrial manufacturing sector will result in decreased demand for the company s products and will adversely affect performance 
risks related to competition the company s business is subject to direct and indirect competition from both domestic and foreign firms 
in particular  low wage foreign sources have created severe competitive pricing pressures 
under certain circumstances  including significant changes in us and foreign currency relationships  such pricing pressures might reduce unit sales and or adversely affect the company s margins
