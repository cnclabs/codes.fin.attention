item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s transactions are denominated would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately  for the year ended july  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
while the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its outstanding debt  the company does not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to its interest rate exposure 
total short term and long term debt outstanding at july  was million  consisting of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at this level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have decreased pre tax earnings by approximately  for the year ended july  at july   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt outstanding was estimated at million 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt
