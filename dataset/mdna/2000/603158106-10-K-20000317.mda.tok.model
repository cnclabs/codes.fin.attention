item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing  distribution and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company adhered to its strategy of expanding its precipitated calcium carbonate pcc product line within the specialty minerals segment 
the company commenced operations at two new large satellite pcc plants  one in china and the other in the united states 
together  these plants have production capacity equivalent to approximately nine satellite units 
a satellite unit is equivalent to annual production capacity of between  and  tons of pcc 
the company also signed a joint venture agreement to construct its first satellite pcc plant in japan 
this plant is expected to be in operation in the third quarter of and will be equivalent to two satellite units 
in addition  the company is also constructing a merchant manufacturing facility in brookhaven  mississippi for the production of specialty pcc  which is used in applications other than paper 
this facility is expected to be in operation during the second quarter of and will be capable of producing between  and  tons of specialty pcc per year 
the company s patented acid tolerant pcc technology continues to show growth and the groundwood sector of the worldwide paper industry continues to show widespread interest in this product 
in addition  the company expanded several satellite plants at various locations around the world and announced a major expansion for in portugal 
as a result  sales of pcc as a percentage of the company s total net sales  which were in  had risen to by the company expects this trend to continue as volume growth of pcc continues to outpace growth in the processed minerals product line and the refractories segment 
the company now operates or has under construction satellite pcc plants in countries 
the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for additional satellite pcc plants 
in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies for the pcc product line continued efforts to increase market penetration in north america  europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
continued expansions of the capacity of existing satellite pcc plants in response to increased demand  which is resulting from increased pcc filler levels in paper  the installation of new paper machines or higher paper machine productivity 
continued research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
the company continues to operate every pcc plant that it has built 
however  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 
failure of a number of the company s customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to the company as those currently in effect could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate 
the company will continue to emphasize specialty products in its refractories segment product lines and to commercialize products  processes and equipment developed through research and development efforts 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including exchange rate fluctuations  nationalization  expropriation  limitations on repatriation of funds and other factors 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries

prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report contains such forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipated  will  and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
the company cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although it believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements 
certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions are discussed under the heading entitled cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of the company s sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing and steel manufacturing industries  which have historically been cyclical 
both industries encountered difficulties in and the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of our business  the company s operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas by january  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
year the year issue arose because many computer programs and electronically controlled devices denote years using only the last two digits 
like other companies  the company uses operating systems  applications and electronically controlled devices that were produced by many different vendors at different times  and many of which were not originally designed to be year compatible 
the company did not experience any material adverse effects of the transition to the year  and while it is possible that such effects may arise in the future  particularly with respect to computerized interfaces with third parties  the company does not expect this to be the case 
in  the company began a project to install new computer hardware and software to improve the capability of the company s information systems  to harmonize the various information technology platforms in use  and to centralize certain financial functions 
the project encompassed corporate financial and accounting functions as well as manufacturing and costing  procurement  planning and scheduling of production and maintenance  and customer order management 
as of december   the company had spent approximately million  including internal costs  for new computer hardware and software  other information technology upgrades and replacements  and upgrades and replacements to non it systems worldwide 
these expenditures provided benefits to the company including  but not limited to  the achievement of year readiness 
the company financed these expenditures solely from working capital  and the total cost associated with its plans to address the year did not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the statements in this section regarding the effect of the year and the company s responses to it are forward looking statements 
they are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable in light of its current knowledge and experience 
a number of contingencies could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
please see cautionary factors that may affect future results in item adoption of a common european currency on january   eleven european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors may choose to pay or be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
on and after january   the affected national currencies will cease to be legal tender 
the company s information technology systems are now able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro and to process transactions and balances in euros 
the financial institutions with which the company does business are capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the national currencies 
the company does not expect that adapting its information technology systems to the euro will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also reviewing contracts with customers and vendors calling for payments in currencies that are to be replaced by the euro  and intends to complete in a timely way any required changes to those contracts 
adoption of the euro is likely to have competitive effects in europe  as prices that had been stated in different national currencies become directly comparable to one another 
in addition  the adoption of a common monetary policy by the countries adopting the euro can be expected to have an effect on the economy of the region 
these competitive and economic effects had no material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation during  and the company does not expect any such effect to occur 
there can be no assurance  however  that the transition to the euro will not have a material effect on the company s business in europe in the future

when appropriate  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts would not subject the company to additional risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged
