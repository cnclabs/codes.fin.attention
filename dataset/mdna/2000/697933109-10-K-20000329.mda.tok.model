item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks of government regulation 
while the trend around the world is to liberalize these regulatory requirements  obtaining the necessary licenses presently involves significant time  expense and expertise 
value added service providers in some cases  panamsat competes with companies to provide value added satellite services 
these companies typically lease large amounts of satellite capacity from satellite operators and then use that capacity to provide value added communications networks for their customers 
for instance  several carriers operate vsat networks for businesses that panamsat also could provide vsat networks 
in addition  brokers in the united states offer value added special events services to broadcasters  businesses and educational institutions that also could be provided by panamsat 
many of these value added service providers and brokers use panamsat s services to meet their customers demands for satellite capacity 
optical fiber cables optical fiber cables  considered to be a reliable method of transmitting data and telephony  generally do not compete with panamsat s current services 
the primary use of optical fiber cables is to carry high volume telephony and data internet communications on a point to point basis 
transcontinental and intercontinental optical fiber cables currently carry video traffic  but this service is largely for point to point traffic eg  new york to london 
optical fiber cables are not readily usable for point to multipoint broadcast applications or for the transmission of ad hoc events that require transportable uplink earth stations 
however  optical fiber is being deployed at a rapid pace by several major companies  including qwest communications  global crossing  enron corp and level communications  and as fiber networks are deployed it is possible that the additional bandwidth may be marketed on a point to multipoint basis 
if this occurs  panamsat may face competition from optical fiber companies  especially for internet and data delivery services 
for certain services  particularly point to point  optical fiber is less expensive than satellite services 
as a result  any competition that panamsat faces from optical fiber companies is likely to be based primarily on price and reliability 
government regulation as an operator of a privately owned global satellite system  panamsat is subject to i the regulatory authority of the us government  ii the regulatory authority of other countries in which panamsat operates  and iii the frequency coordination process of the international telecommunications union itu 
us regulation the ownership and operation of panamsat s satellite system is regulated by the fcc 
panamsat is subject to the fcc s jurisdiction primarily for i the licensing of satellites and us based earth stations in the united states  ii avoidance of interference with other radio stations  and iii compliance with fcc rules governing us licensed satellite systems 
violations of the fcc s rules can result in various sanctions including fines  loss of authorizations  or the denial of applications for new authorizations or to renew existing authorizations 
panamsat is not regulated as a common carrier and  therefore  is not subject to rate regulation or the obligation not to discriminate among customers  and operates with minimal governmental scrutiny of its business decisions 
panamsat must pay fcc filing fees in connection with its space station and earth station applications  annual regulatory fees that are intended to defray the fcc s regulatory expenses  and  to the extent panamsat is deemed to be providing interstate or international telecommunications  universal service contributions 
authorization to launch and operate satellites 
the fcc authorizes satellite operators who meet its legal  technical and financial qualification requirements to launch and operate satellites 
under the fcc s financial qualification rules  an applicant must demonstrate that it has sufficient funds to construct  launch  and operate each requested satellite for one year 
licenses are issued for an initial ten year term and the fcc gives licensees a replacement expectancy with respect to the replacement of their satellites 
at the end of a ten year license term  a satellite that has not been replaced  or that has been re located to another orbital location following its replacement  may be able to continue operating under a grant of special temporary authority 
these operations  however  are secondary  and there can be no assurance that the satellite will be permitted to continue operating after the expiration of the initial ten year license term 
the fcc s rules and policies limit the number of expansion satellite authorizations that may be granted for the same frequency band at one time 
panamsat has final fcc authorization for sixteen satellites operating in the c band  the ku band  or both bands  and a non final authorization for a hybrid c ku band satellite 
panamsat has final fcc authorization for one additional satellite  but the authorization does not cover certain design changes that are the subject of a pending modification application 
panamsat has special temporary authority to operate the satellite as modified on an interim basis 
in addition  panamsat has a final authorization to operate nine satellites in the ka band one in the aor  to be located at degrees wl  two in the por  to be located at degrees el and degrees el  four in the ior  to be located at degrees el  degrees el  degrees el  and degrees el  and two in the united states  to be located at l degrees wl and degrees wl panamsat has also requested authority to operate seven of these satellites in the broadcast satellite services frequency bss band  and to operate five other satellites exclusively in the bss band  but fcc processing of panamsat s requests must await the resolution of issues concerning the itu s bss band plan 
in addition to the above final authorizations  panamsat has a conditional authorization for an ior satellite in the c band and ku band  to be located at degrees el in order to finalize this authorization  panamsat must make a full financial showing 
except as noted  none of panamsat s final or conditional authorizations is subject to further administrative or judicial reconsideration or review 
the fcc reserves the right to require relocation of a satellite to a different orbital location if it determines that relocation is in the public interest 
panamsat operates additional satellites under interim or special temporary authority 
panamsat operates pas at degrees el pursuant to a grant of special temporary authority 
panamsat is authorized to operate only the ku band transponders on the satellite 
brasilsat al previously provided us domestic service from degrees wl under an interim authorization that expired on december  panamsat has requested  but has not yet received  an extension of this authority 
pursuant to a grant of special temporary authority  the company has relocated brasilsat a to degrees wl and it is operating there 
the company also has amended its request for an extension of interim authority to specify the degrees wl orbital location 
another satellite  sbs  exceeded its regular license term in and  since that time  has operated at degrees wl under successive grants of special temporary authority 
sbs must be relocated once the us satellite assigned to degrees wl is launched 
there can be no assurance that sbs will be authorized to operate at another orbital location 
panamsat also has requested a license modification or special temporary authority to continue operating pas beyond the end of its license term 
in addition  following the loss of galaxy iv  the fcc granted the company special temporary authority to relocate galaxy vi from degrees wl to degrees wl  to provide replacement c band capacity 
panamsat operates the hgs satellite at degrees wl under a grant of special temporary authority from the fcc  and may continue such operations until days before a satellite operating on the same frequencies and serving the same geographic area  and that has filed a valid prior coordination request with the itu  is launched to within one degree of degrees wl see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks of government regulation 
panamsat has filed applications for additional or replacement satellites in the c band and or the ku band at degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  degrees wl  and degrees el in order to grant two of the el additional satellite applications  the fcc would have to assign different orbital locations than those requested by panamsat degrees wl and degrees wl because  after panamsat s applications were filed  the fcc assigned these orbital locations to other entities 
panamsat has requested that the degrees wl application be associated with the degrees wl orbital location as a c band only satellite 
in  the fcc modified its rules for processing international satellite system applications 
panamsat has requested a waiver of these rules in connection with one ior application and one us application 
panamsat has filed applications for six additional ka band satellites two in the aor  two in the por and two in the ior  that will be processed in the second ka band satellite processing round 
finally  panamsat has applied for twelve v band satellites two in the aor  six in the ior and four in the us  but the fcc has not yet accepted these applications for filing 
under the fcc s rules  unless an applicant has received an authorization to launch and operate  it must notify the fcc in writing prior to commencing satellite construction  and any construction engaged in is at the applicant s own risk 
while panamsat may proceed with the construction of planned satellites without prior fcc approval  it must accept the risk that the fcc may not grant the application  may not assign the satellite to its proposed orbital location  or otherwise may act in a manner that limits or eliminates some or all of the value of the construction previously done on the satellite 
other fcc authorizations 
under the fcc s rules  an entity that provides international telecommunications services on a common carrier basis must first receive authorization  pursuant to section of the communications act of  as amended  to provide such services 
the fcc has granted panamsat carrier services  inc pcsi and panamsat communications carrier services  inc pccs  wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  section authority to provide international private line and public switched services 
as common carriers  pcsi and pccs are subject to rate regulation  tariffing and nondiscrimination requirements 
scope of services authorized 
in  the fcc eliminated the regulatory distinction between us domestic satellites and us licensed international satellites 
as a result  each of panamsat s satellites may be used  to the extent technically feasible  to provide service in the united states and internationally 
due to a restriction in the fcc s rules  however  the transponders on pas that operate in the ghz and ghz frequency bands may be used solely for international service 
coordination requirements 
the fcc requires applicants to demonstrate that their proposed satellites would be compatible with the operations of adjacent satellites 
the fcc expects adjacent satellite operators to coordinate with one another to minimize frequency conflicts  and it does not become involved unless the operators are unable to resolve their conflicts 
other us government regulation 
the us congress has added communications satellites to the munitions list governed by the international traffic in arms regulations itar  and transferred responsibility from the commerce department to the state department for licensing the export of satellites and technical information related to satellites to non us launch providers  insurers  customers  potential customers  employees  and other non us persons 
the state department s interpretation of the regulations as they would be applied to panamsat is not clear  and it is possible that these regulations could adversely affect or delay the company s ability to launch and insure its satellites and to sell capacity to non us customers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks of government regulation generally and for a description of certain frequency coordination issues affecting pas  pas and galaxy viii i 
regulation by non us national telecommunications authorities foreign laws and regulatory practices governing the provision of satellite services to licensed entities and directly to end users vary substantially 
most countries in which panamsat operates are signatories of intelsat and  as a result  may require panamsat to confirm that it has successfully completed coordination with intelsat before providing services on a given satellite 
see intelsat coordination 
in addition  panamsat may be subject to national communications and or broadcasting laws with respect to its provision of international satellite service 
while these vary from country to country  national telecommunications authorities  with limited exceptions  typically have not required satellite operators to obtain licenses or regulatory authorizations in order to provide space segment capacity to licensed entities 
space segment capacity consists solely of capacity on a given satellite without any uplink  downlink or other value added services 
many countries  particularly in latin america  and increasingly in europe  africa and asia  have liberalized their regulations to permit multiple entities to seek licenses to i provide voice  data or video services for their own use or for third party use  ii own and operate private earth station equipment  and iii to choose a provider of satellite capacity 
this trend should accelerate with the commitments by many world trade organization wto members  in the context of the wto agreement on basic telecommunications services  to open their satellite markets to competition 
many countries allow licensed radio and television broadcasters and cable television providers to own their own transmission broadcast facilities and purchase satellite capacity without restriction 
in such environments  customer access to panamsat s services can be a relatively simple procedure 
other countries  however  have maintained strict monopoly regimes 
in these markets  a single entity  often the government owned posts  telephone and telegraph authorities  may hold a monopoly on the ownership and operation of facilities or on the provision of communications and or broadcasting services to  from  and within the country  including via satellite  making it more difficult for panamsat and other companies to provide services on us licensed satellites 
most countries permit satellite carriers to provide space segment capacity without any prior licensing or authorization 
in others  however  a license is required to provide space segment capacity 
panamsat has obtained such licenses in argentina  colombia  ecuador  pakistan and peru 
additionally  the company has sought service type licenses  in order to provide certain space segment capacity directly to end users 
panamsat has obtained such licenses in australia  france  germany  japan and the united kingdom 
panamsat does not  however  have authorization in brazil  mexico and india  which affects its ability to use certain portions of its satellite capacity 
notwithstanding the wide variety of regulatory regimes in the countries where panamsat provides service  panamsat believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations 
intelsat coordination 
in connection with its international satellite services  panamsat must coordinate with intelsat to assure that the use by panamsat of any new satellite will not cause intelsat technical harm 
the fcc is responsible for ensuring that panamsat has undergone the necessary coordinations and that it operates in accordance with the technical parameters forming the basis for each coordination 
if panamsat changes the terms either technical or service of its operation in a significant manner  it may need to re coordinate with intelsat 
the itu frequency coordination process 
each itu member nation is required to register its proposed use of orbital slots with the itu s radio regulations board 
other nations then may give notice of any use or intended use of the radio spectrum that would conflict with the proposal 
the nations then are obligated to seek to coordinate the proposed uses and resolve interference concerns 
if all disputes are resolved  the itu notifies the proposed use which  at least theoretically  protects it from subsequent or nonconforming interfering uses 
the itu radio regulations board has no dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms  however  and international law provides no clear remedies if this voluntary process fails 
while the right to use most frequencies is determined on a first come  first served basis  the itu has planned the use of certain frequency bands in a manner that effectively reserves for various countries the right to use those frequencies in accordance with certain technical parameters at a given orbital location 
panamsat s proposed use of bss frequencies on eleven satellites is subject to unresolved issues concerning the itu s bss band plan 
all of the registrations for panamsat s satellites are or will be subject to the itu coordination process 
certain entities have filed notices of intended use with respect to certain orbital slots which conflict with panamsat s registered orbital slots for pas  pas  pas and pas such filings may delay the receipt of final registration of such orbital slots with the itu radio regulations board

item legal proceedings on or about october   an action was commenced by comsat against panamsat  news corporation limited news and grupo television  sa televisa in the united states district court for the central district of california 
the complaint alleges that news wrongfully terminated an agreement with comsat for the lease of transponders on an intelsat satellite over the term of a five year lease  breached certain alleged promises related to such agreement  and breached its alleged obligations under a tariff filed by comsat with the fcc 
as to panamsat  the complaint alleges that panamsat  alone and in conspiracy with televisa  intentionally interfered with the alleged agreement and with comsat s economic relationship with news 
comsat had previously filed a similar action in the united states district court for the district of maryland 
by order dated october   the maryland district court dismissed without prejudice the complaint in that action on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over all of the defendants 
the complaint in the present action seeks actual and consequential damages  and punitive or exemplary damages in an amount to be determined at trial 
panamsat believes this action is without merit 
it intends to vigorously contest this matter  although there can be no assurance that panamsat will prevail

results of operations the company s results of operations as reported incorporate panamsat international s activity commencing may   the effective date of the merger 
since this represents only seven and one half months of activity for panamsat international in  management has determined that  for comparative purposes  it would be more meaningful to present the information shown for on a pro forma basis reflecting the merger as though it had occurred at the beginning of excluding the impact of panamsat international s million gain on the sale of its direct to home television rights in certain foreign markets to an affiliate concurrent with the merger  as well as certain professional and advisory fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the merger totaling million  both of which are nonrecurring items that are not indicative of the company s ordinary course of business

revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in video services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same period in the increase was primarily due to new service agreements on satellites placed in service in  as well as continued growth in special events service revenues as compared to the same period in telecommunications services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same period in the increase was due primarily to the growth in data and internet related service agreements 
revenue results can also be analyzed based on the type of agreement 
revenues from sales and sales type leases decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is attributable to a lower volume in relative to of outright sales and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the commencement of commercial service on new international satellites  as well as continued growth in special events service revenues in leaseback expense  net of deferred gain 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities on sale leaseback agreements during direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to direct costs associated with additional satellites placed in service and operating costs associated with the normal growth of the company attributable to the growth in the size of the satellite network 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with additional satellites placed in service 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue generated by the expanded satellite network and decreased leaseback expense  net of deferred gain as a result of the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities  offset by increased depreciation and direct operating costs associated with the company s expanded satellite network 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from new debt assumed in connection with the exercise of an early buy out opportunity under a sale leaseback transaction during as well as increased borrowing levels during the year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was due to the increase in income before income taxes as well as an increase in the effective tax rate between and as a result of a reduction in foreign sales corporation tax benefits 
as reported compared to pro forma and as reported the following discussion of versus performance is primarily based on pro forma results 
pro forma results for and as reported results reflect the impact of the acquisition of panamsat international  including the use of purchase accounting 
comparisons of as reported results reflect significant increases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense  the effective income tax rate and shares outstanding arising from the merger 
revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in video services revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the same pro forma period in the decrease was primarily due to fewer sales and less sales type lease activity as compared to the same pro forma period in telecommunications services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same pro forma period in the increase was due primarily to the growth in data and internet related service agreements 
revenue results can also be analyzed based on the type of agreement 
revenues from sales and sales type leases decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease is attributable to a lower volume in relative to of outright sales and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the increase was primarily due to the commencement of commercial service on two new satellites  pas and galaxy viii i  which were launched in the latter part of and generated a full year of operating lease revenues in as reported  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the impact of the merger  and also due to increased service agreements associated with available transponder capacity 
cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
the company recorded no cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same pro forma period in the pro forma cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december  are related to several outright sales and sales type leases executed during that period 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities on sale leaseback agreements during direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the increase was due primarily to direct costs associated with additional satellites placed in service and operating costs associated with the normal growth of the company attributable to the growth in the size of the satellite network 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with additional satellites placed in service 
as reported  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  from million in in addition to the impact of the merger  the increase was a result of depreciation expense associated with additional transponder capacity placed in service 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was due primarily to increased depreciation and direct operating costs associated with the company s expanded satellite network  offset by increased revenue generated by the expanded satellite network 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the increase was due primarily to higher average borrowing levels during as well as less interest income earned as a result of the company s smaller investment portfolio and a lower amount of capitalized interest cost for the satellites under construction resulting from the lower borrowing rate in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was due to the decrease in income before income taxes as well as to a lower effective tax rate in principally as a result of utilization of foreign sales corporation tax benefits 
minority interest 
minority interest  representing preferred stock dividends of panamsat international  were for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was due to the conversion of panamsat international s mandatorily exchangeable senior redeemable preferred stock due into senior subordinated notes due in the third quarter of and the related termination of dividend payment obligations 
approximately of the senior subordinated notes were subsequently retired in connection with the tender offer and restructuring program described above 
extraordinary item 
the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million million before taxes during related to the early extinguishment of certain indebtedness of panamsat s subsidiaries 
the charge principally represented the excess of the price paid for the debt over its carrying value  net of any deferred financing costs and fair value adjustments recognized in connection with the merger 
satellite deployment plan and planned satellites satellite deployment plan panamsat s satellite deployment plan is intended to enable the company to provide back up and replacement capacity as well as expanded satellite services on an expedited basis in the united states and worldwide 
panamsat launched the first two satellites in the satellite deployment plan  galaxy xi and galaxy xr  on december  and january   respectively 
panamsat expects to launch five additional satellites by mid  consisting of three new satellites for the aor pas r  pas and galaxy iii c  one new satellite for the united states galaxy ivr  and one new satellite for the ior pas 
panamsat also plans to retire one satellite  sbs  this year 
this will result in a planned total fleet of satellites  including multiple satellites in each ocean region worldwide and one in orbit spare satellite galaxy vi for the united states 
the company also has options to procure two additional satellites for launch on an expedited basis 
planned satellites galaxy ivr 
galaxy ivr is an hs hp model spacecraft and is scheduled for launch during the second quarter of on an ariane launch vehicle 
galaxy ivr will serve at degrees wl as the replacement for galaxy iv 
pas r 
pas r will be an hs spacecraft and is scheduled for launch in the second quarter of pas r will be launched on an ariane launcher and will be located at degrees wl the company plans to use pas r in the americas  europe and africa 
pas lr is intended to replace and significantly expand upon the capacity offered by pas l  which has reached the end of its design life but may be used to back up pas r or moved to another orbital location to be determined 
pas this satellite will be an hs spacecraft  and will be located in the aor 
the company anticipates that it will be launched aboard the sea launch launch vehicle in the second quarter of the orbital location of pas will be at degrees wl the company s mexico dth customer that had contracted for service on pas instead has contracted to take service on pas the ku band transponders on pas will not be resold on a full time basis  and the company anticipates that this will minimize potential disruptions to pas s c band customers related to the battery cell anomalies affecting pas see risk factors risk of in orbit failure or reduced performance 
pas this satellite will be an hs spacecraft 
it is scheduled for launch in the fourth quarter of on a proton launch vehicle and is expected to occupy an orbital position in the ior at degrees el some of the company s key customers on pas have contracted to migrate to pas upon its deployment 
galaxy iii c 
this satellite will be an hs spacecraft  designed to cover the united states and latin america 
it is scheduled to be launched in the second quarter of and it is expected to occupy an orbital position located at degrees wl as a result of the company s planned launches  the company currently intends to relocate a number of its satellites 

upon deployment of galaxy ivr at degrees wl  galaxy xi currently at degrees wl will be moved to degrees wl galaxy vii will then be moved from degrees w 
l to an orbital location to be determined and galaxy vi will be moved from degrees w 
l to degrees wl where it will continue to provide back up services 

galaxy ix will be relocated from degrees wl to degrees wl because galaxy xr is now permanently located at degrees wl 
galaxy iii c is expected to be deployed at degrees wl  galaxy iiir s current location  to provide services to the united states and latin america 
upon this launch  galaxy iiir will be moved for service at a new orbital location to be determined 

it is anticipated that the pas satellite will be used for back up capacity for pas b customers from a location to be determined 
the implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to regulatory approval by the fcc 
the company expects that after the launch of the satellites as described above  the revenues attributable to the galaxy vi  galaxy vii  pas and pas satellites will be at reduced levels compared to the company s other satellites 
the company has not yet determined whether revenue will be adversely affected on galaxy iiir after the completion of the satellite deployment plan 
no assurance can be given that commercially suitable orbital locations will be obtained for all of these satellites 
successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to risks attendant to the company s business and the requirement of additional capital 
see liquidity and capital resources and risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the merger  the company obtained a term loan in the amount of billion the hughes term loan from hughes electronics 
in addition to the hughes term loan  as of december   the company also had long term indebtedness of million comprised primarily of million of notes as defined below and million of notes assumed in connection with the exercise of an early buy out opportunity under a sale leaseback transaction as described below 
on january   panamsat completed a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act of for million aggregate principal amount of debt securities the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay bank loans incurred partially to finance a tender offer for certain debt securities of panamsat s subsidiaries  as well as for general corporate purposes 
in august  the company converted the private securities to public debt the notes by means of a registered exchange offer 
the company is party to a credit agreement the credit agreement  dated december   with certain lenders and citicorp usa  inc as administrative agent 
the credit agreement provides the company with loans of up to million under a five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
in the third quarter of  the company amended the credit agreement to modify a financial covenant principally as a result of the impact of a manufacturing delay announced in may the company currently has million available under the revolving credit facility less any amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program as described below 
on july   the company initiated a million commercial paper program the commercial paper program 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program are limited to million in the aggregate and are expected to be used to fund the company s satellite construction program 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the revolving credit facility as of december  in april  the company filed two insurance claims related to anomalies on its pas and pas satellites 
the claim on the pas satellite was for a partial loss primarily resulting from the loss in geographic coverage  connectivity and or switchability of the ku band transponders 
the claim on pas was for a constructive total loss of the satellite because the company has ceased using all of the ku band capacity of the satellite on a full time basis  which represents more than of the satellite s communications capacity 
in august  the company filed an insurance claim on its galaxy viii i satellite for a partial loss primarily resulting from battery cell failures 
in september  the company met with its insurance carriers and agreed to settle all of the claims for net cash to panamsat of approximately million  of which approximately million was collected as of december  the insurance settlements were recognized as offsets to the carrying values of the related satellites  and no gain or loss has been recognized in as a result of these settlements 
during the third quarter of  the company s credit ratings were downgraded to bbb a by standard and poor s 
as a result of this downgrade  the company expects that it will not issue commercial paper pursuant to its commercial paper program and instead expects to draw upon its revolving credit facility to fund its borrowing needs 
loans under the revolving credit facility of up to million were made during the fourth quarter at interest rates ranging from to 
the company repaid these loans in the fourth quarter of with the proceeds from its insurance 
the hughes term loan is subordinate to the notes issued in connection with the offering  the revolving credit facility and any notes issued under the commercial paper program 
the company had options under sale leaseback arrangements to repurchase the transponders on galaxy vii and galaxy iiir prior to the end of their respective lease terms 
in january  the company repurchased c band and ku band transponders on galaxy vii for approximately million  including a make whole premium of million 
the company repurchased the remaining transponders on galaxy vii and the transponders on galaxy iiir in july for a total cost of approximately million in cash  plus the assumption of million of floating rate debt 
the notes bear interest at libor plus and mature on various dates through january  as of december   other than indemnity obligations  the company no longer had any obligations under sale leaseback agreements 
the significant cash outlays for the company will continue to be primarily capital expenditures related to the construction and launch of satellites  debt service costs and potential acquisitions 
the company now has five satellites under various stages of development and intends to deploy net for which it has budgeted capital expenditures 
the company will require approximately million to construct  insure and launch the satellites  and plans to invest up to million in capital and operating expenses over the next two years to deploy net the largest portion of panamsat s investment in net will be used to deploy panamsat owned antennas and servers at isps  cable headends and dsl provider sites 
assuming satellites in development are successfully launched  services on the satellites commence on the schedule currently contemplated and net is deployed as and when expected  panamsat believes that amounts available under the revolving credit facility  vendor financing  future cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its operations and its remaining costs for the construction and launch of satellites currently under development for the next twelve months and for the deployment of net for the next twenty four months 
there can be no assurance  however  that panamsat s assumptions with respect to costs for future construction and launch of its satellites and costs to deploy net will be correct  or that amounts available under the revolving credit facility  vendor financing  future cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in funding for i launches caused by launch failures  ii cost overruns  iii delays or iv other unanticipated expenses 
in addition  if the company were to consummate any strategic transactions or undertake any other projects requiring significant capital expenditures  it may be required to seek additional financing 
if circumstances were to require panamsat to incur additional indebtedness  the ability of panamsat to incur any such additional indebtedness would be subject to the terms of panamsat s outstanding indebtedness 
the failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on panamsat s operations and its ability to accomplish its business plan 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in  from million in  an increase from million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to proceeds from insurance claims received during the increase in was primarily attributable to increased operating results  proceeds from insurance claims and reductions in non cash working capital as compared to net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in  from million in  a decrease from  million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to reduced capital expenditures in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of panamsat international during the same period in  coupled with proceeds from insurance claims received during net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in and  million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower net borrowings associated with the company s satellites under construction 
the decrease in was primarily due to obtaining the hughes term loan during the same period in market risks the following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain market conditions may occur 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions because the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections by panamsat of future events or losses 
panamsat s cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates and certain of its financial instruments are subject to changes in market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
panamsat manages its exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
panamsat s policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
panamsat does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
as of december  and december   long term debt  which is classified as held to maturity  consisted of fixed rate borrowings of million   million of floating rate merger related borrowings due to hughes and various other fixed and floating rate borrowings 
panamsat is subject to fluctuating interest rates on its floating rate debt and any changes in interest rates would impact results of operations and cash flows 
the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates for one year on panamsat s floating rate debt outstanding at december  would be a reduction in cash flows of approximately million  and a reduction in net income of approximately million in each year 
fluctuations in interest rates may also affect the market values of fixed rate borrowings and fixed rate net investments in sales type lease receivables 
at december  and  outstanding borrowings bore interest at rates ranging from to and sales type lease receivables bore interest at 
the potential fair value change resulting from a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates related to panamsat s outstanding debt and sales type receivable balances would be approximately million and million  as of december  and december   respectively 
in connection with debt refinancing activities in  panamsat entered into certain us treasury rate lock contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the aggregate notional value of these contracts was million and these contracts were accounted for as hedges 
the cost to settle these instruments in was million and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt securities 
risk factors risk of launch failure 
satellites are subject to significant risks related to delayed and failed launches 
of the satellite launches by panamsat or its predecessors since  the company has experienced four launch failures 
for example  in the company s galaxy x satellite was destroyed during the inaugural launch of the boeing delta iii rocket which exploded shortly after liftoff 
in addition  certain launch vehicles scheduled to be used by panamsat have unproven track records and are susceptible to certain risks associated with new launch vehicles 
for example  on october   a proton launch vehicle that did not carry any of the company s satellites suffered a launch failure 
in addition  sea launch is a launcher that is scheduled to be used by panamsat to launch satellites within the next year 
although successful demonstration launches on the sea launch were completed in march and a successful commercial launch was conducted in october  a commercial satellite launched from sea launch by a british communications company failed in march just after liftoff 
the failure is currently under investigation by the sea launch program and  as a result  it is unclear how this failure will affect future launches scheduled for sea launch 
panamsat is currently evaluating its options with respect to its satellites that are scheduled for launch from sea launch during the next year in light of the recent failure and the potential delays that may result while the failure is under investigation 
although panamsat s insurance coverage for these potential losses is sufficient to substantially recover the company s investment  the company does not obtain insurance to recover lost revenues or business opportunities 
in addition  the design  construction and delivery of a replacement satellite could take up to months 
risk of launch delays 
the company has experienced launch delays in the past which have an adverse affect on revenues 
future delays may have the same result 
launch delays can result from the delays in the construction of satellites and launch vehicles  the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities  possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and obtain other launch opportunities 
further  a significant delay in the delivery of any satellite would adversely affect the company s marketing plan for the satellite 
if satellite construction schedules are not met  there can be no assurance that a launch opportunity will be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched 
finally  any significant delay in the launch of any of panamsat s satellites could enable customers who pre purchased or agreed to lease capacity of the satellites to terminate their contracts 
the failure to implement the satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of in orbit failure or reduced performance 
satellites are also subject to risks after they have been properly deployed and put into operation 
if any of these risks set forth below occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
these risks include 
manufacturing errors following the launch of the company s pas satellite  an error of the satellite s manufacturer was discovered that affected the geographical coverage or flexibility of all of the ku band transponders on the satellite 
the c band beams have not been affected by the error 

new technology the likelihood of in orbit failure or performance reduction may be heightened by panamsat s use of new technology on certain of its satellites 
galaxy xi  pas r and galaxy iii c are hughes manufactured hs model spacecraft 
the hs model has no track record and may be susceptible to certain risks related to its new technology 
there can be no assurance that panamsat s planned use of hs model spacecraft will be successful 

circuit failures pas experienced several circuit failures in its solar arrays and may experience additional failures in the future 
circuit failures require the company to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years 
no assurance can be given that additional circuit failures will not occur 

spacecraft control processor failures three of the company s satellites  galaxy iv  galaxy vii and pas  experienced an anomaly in their on board spacecraft control processors scps  which are believed to have resulted from electrical short circuits involving tin plated relay switches 
each satellite contains a primary scp and a back up scp 
galaxy iv was declared a total loss in may after both of its scps failed and galaxy vii and pas are operating on back up scp systems after their primary scps failed 
of the satellites owned by panamsat that were constructed by hsc  five satellites are the same model spacecraft as the affected satellites 
no assurance can be given that similar or additional scp failures will not occur 

battery cell failures pas and galaxy viii i have experienced battery cell failures 
the batteries sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods  having a duration of one minute to a maximum of minutes per day  which occur during two day periods around each of march and september the manufacturer of the satellites  hsc  conducted an extensive analysis of the battery data and concluded that the nature of the battery problem is such that slow degradation of the battery cells may occur during normal battery management procedures 
panamsat has adopted a battery management strategy during eclipse seasons intended to manage any future problems with battery cells 
there can be no assurance that additional battery cell failures will not occur in future eclipse seasons 
risks of government regulation 
panamsat is subject to the regulatory authority of the us government  primarily the fcc  and the national communications authorities of the countries in which it operates 
if panamsat does not obtain all requisite regulatory approvals for the construction  launch and operation of any of panamsat s future satellites and for the orbital slots planned for these satellites or  the licenses obtained impose operational restrictions on panamsat  panamsat s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that panamsat will succeed in coordinating any or all of its future satellites internationally 
the risks of government regulation include 
some orbital slot designations may change or expire sbs s fcc license expired in  and the satellite is operated pursuant to grants of special temporary authority that are renewed periodically 
following the failure of galaxy iv  the fcc granted the company special temporary authority to relocate galaxy vi from degrees wl to degrees wl to provide replacement c band capacity 
in addition  the company has received special temporary authority to relocate brasilsat a from degrees wl to degrees wl and to operate brasilsat a at the new orbital location 
no assurance can be given that the company s orbital slots granted under temporary authority will be renewed in the future 
the fcc also reserves the right to require satellites to be re located to a different orbital location if it determines that re location is in the public interest 

replacement satellites and expanded frequency coverage are subject to regulatory approval some of the company s planned satellites are intended as replacements for the company s current satellites 
there can be no assurance that these planned replacement satellites will be able to occupy their proposed orbital location 
generally  the fcc gives a replacement expectancy with respect to the use of the same orbital location at the same frequencies for replacement satellites 
the grant of a replacement expectancy may increase the likelihood that panamsat will be able to use its replacement satellite to expand the frequencies or coverages employed by the predecessors  however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful at expanding such frequencies and coverages 

the us government limits the use of us launch providers all of panamsat s planned launches are scheduled to occur on non us launch providers 
because the us government limits the use of non us launch providers  panamsat scheduled launches could be delayed or canceled if panamsat cannot find an alternate launch provider 
there is a trade agreement between the united states and the russian federation that limits the number of satellites manufactured in the united states that may be launched aboard russian launch vehicles through the end of the year these limitations may affect panamsat launches on russian rockets 
although panamsat s russian launch provider has informed the company that it is seeking to have the limit raised or eliminated  it may not be 
the failure to have such limits raised or eliminated could result in a launch delay or increased launch costs 

use and coverage areas of satellite frequencies are regulated certain of the ku band downlink beams on pas include coverage  at very low power levels  of the west coast of the united states and of hawaii 
because the ku band frequencies on these beams are allocated in the united states to the bss  panamsat s coverage of the united states is on a non conforming use basis  requiring that panamsat not interfere with  and accept interference from  any authorized users in the united states 
if panamsat s efforts to resolve issues relating to this non conforming use status are not successful  panamsat may not be able to operate these satellites as intended 

some satellite frequencies must be coordinated individually with the government certain of the frequencies that are intended to be used to uplink to pas  pas pas b  galaxy viii i and galaxy iii c must be coordinated with the us government on an earth station by earth station basis to ensure that harmful interference to government operations is minimized 
although panamsat has undertaken such coordination and believes that it will either be able to coordinate successfully with federal government users or to institute operational solutions that will mitigate the problem  its failure to do so may make it impossible to operate these satellites as planned 
panamsat s successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan depends upon the company s ability to obtain regulatory authorization to operate its satellites at certain locations 
if panamsat does not obtain all of the authorizations necessary to complete the satellite deployment plan on schedule  its business prospects could be materially adversely affected 
see item business government regulation 
risks of doing business internationally 
panamsat  its customers or companies with which panamsat does business must have authority from each country in which panamsat provides services or its customers use its satellites 
the failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate its satellites internationally could have a material adverse effect on panamsat s business 
the risks of doing business internationally include 
new or changes in law or policies the company could be adversely affected by new laws  regulations  policies or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  regulations or policies that modify the present regulatory environment 
for instance  the governments of pakistan and india recently notified the company that they separately intend to impose withholding tax on payments to the company for providing satellite services to india and pakistan  respectively 
the company believes that the payments are exempt from indian and pakistani taxation under the united states india income tax treaty and the united states pakistan income tax treaty  respectively  and  therefore  has taken measures to contest the imposition of such withholding taxes 
even if the withholding taxes were imposed and upheld  the company believes its customers would be contractually responsible for the payment of such taxes and the company would be entitled to full payment  without deduction for any such taxes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to contest the imposition of such taxes by the governments of india and pakistan 
if other governments decide to adopt similar policies  the operations and business of the company could be materially adversely affected 
see item business government regulation 

local non us regulatory schemes panamsat believes that it presently holds the requisite licenses and approvals for the countries in which it currently operates 
the regulatory schemes in each country  however  are different 
as a result  there may be non us governmental regulations of which panamsat is not aware 
further  portions of panamsat s present and future satellites are designed to provide service to countries in which regulatory impediments exist 
there can be no assurance that any current regulatory approvals held by panamsat are  or will remain  sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  in all jurisdictions in which the company wishes to operate its new satellites or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly burdensome 
in addition  it is unlikely that pas will be permitted to operate any of its c band transponders until certain coordination issues are resolved with the russian federation 
risk of uninsured loss 
although the company obtains launch insurance policies designed to cover the cost to construct  launch and insure replacement satellites  there is a risk that certain losses may not be covered by the company s policies 
typically  panamsat s launch policies are effective for a period ranging between three and five years from the date of a satellite launch 
during that time  if a covered malfunction occurs  but no loss is incurred until after the expiration of the policy  the launch insurance policy will not cover the loss  and a subsequent in orbit policy obtained may either exclude losses related to the known event or impose deductibles that exceed the loss associated with the event 
in addition  panamsat does not obtain insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite malfunctions 
see item business insurance 
risks associated with the internet initiative net will rely on panamsat s existing and future satellite network 
net will utilize panamsat s satellites  and will be subject to all of the risks described above 
furthermore  panamsat initially has allocated up to ku band transponders 
the availability of these transponders assumes that panamsat s existing satellites do not suffer any material in orbit failures and that future launches are timely and successful 
any delays or failures of panamsat satellites could adversely affect the availability of satellite coverage for net net will be deployed in complex environments and is dependent on integrating various existing technologies into a seamless network 
net is highly complex 
as a result  during its initial commercial deployment  the network may suffer technical problems due to integrating the various technologies 
if these technical problems occur  net s deployment could be delayed and the company may incur additional expenses and suffer lost anticipated revenues 
the successful deployment of net depends on panamsat s ability to establish relationships with third parties for the use and ownership of technology and the right to deploy equipment at isps 
the company will need to deploy its servers in the facilities of isps  including cable headends and dsl providers 
panamsat has entered into and must continue to enter into relationships with other technology providers in order to successfully roll out net there can be no assurance that panamsat will be able to enter into additional relationships with technology providers on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that these relationships will allow panamsat to achieve its intended objectives 
the success of net is dependent upon the growth of the last mile broadband capacity 
the success of net depends in part on the growth of available  last mile broadband capacity for internet end users  such as dsl  cable television  fiber optic cable and fixed wireless systems 
no assurance can be given that this growth will occur or that internet end users will purchase the broadband capacity consistent with panamsat s expectations 
the success of net depends on market acceptance of the services that panamsat intends to offer over its network 
panamsat believes that new and existing content providers  such as data and video customers  and internet end users will purchase  on a pay per view basis  the services offered by net there can be no assurance  however  that either content providers or internet end users will purchase the services offered by net in the quantity or on the terms that panamsat expects 
in addition  new and existing content providers and internet end users may require features and capabilities that net does not have 
to achieve market acceptance of net  panamsat must effectively anticipate and adapt to the requirements and demands of content providers and internet end users 
failure of panamsat to meet these demands may result in delays  additional expense and lost anticipated revenues
