in  the company began to focus its business development efforts on the software industry  building its inventory of software products through contracts with software publishers 
in  the company began to develop software distribution relationships through contracts with online retailers 
in the second quarter of the company added approximately  software publisher clients through its acquisition of three electronic commerce outsourcing providers to the shareware publishing industry  maagnum internet group  public software library and universal commerce  incorporated 
as of december   the company had approximately  software publisher clients and  online retailer clients that it serves under its software and digital services group

the company derives its revenue primarily from sales of third party software 
the company has contractual relationships with its software publisher and online retailer clients which obligate the company to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
revenues from the sale of software products  net of estimated returns  are recognized upon either delivery through electronic software delivery esd or shipment of the physical product to the end user 
the amount payable to the software publisher or online retailer is reported as cost of sales 
the company bears full credit risk with respect to substantially all sales 
in late  the company began formally offering e commerce service for products other than third party software  under its e business services group 
the company derives its revenue from development fees  transaction processing and hosting fees as well as service fees 
most e business revenue is recognized as services are performed  with the exception of annual fees and certain integration fees which are recognized evenly over the term of the contract 
the company generated less than of its revenue from e business services 
there can be no assurance that the company will derive any significant revenue from this service 
the company has a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its business and prospects 
since inception  the company has incurred significant losses  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company intends to expend significant financial and management resources on the development of additional services  sales and marketing  technology and operations to support larger scale operations and greater service offerings 
as a result  the company expects to incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future  and such losses are anticipated to increase significantly from current levels 
there can be no assurance that the company s sales will increase or even continue at their current level or that the company will achieve or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as electronic commerce 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  maintain existing and develop new relationships with software publishers  online retailers and e business clients  implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy  continue to develop and upgrade its technology and transaction processing systems  provide superior customer service and order fulfillment  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s current and future expense levels are based largely on its planned operations and estimates of future sales 
sales and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast
