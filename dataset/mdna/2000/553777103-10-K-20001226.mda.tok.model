market risk on changes in foreign currency exchange rates market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause fluctuations on the translation of orders  net revenue and net income 
currency gains and losses from the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions are reported in the consolidated statements of income as other expense income  net 
the following table illustrates the impact of such market risk on the above financial items for the respective years expressed in thousands increase decrease from translation new orders    net revenue    net income transaction gain loss in other expense income  net  the company regularly assesses risks from foreign currency exchange rates and has practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
to manage such risk  the company  when deemed appropriate  enters into forward contracts 
the company is principally exposed to foreign currency movements related to non us dollar denominated assets and uncertainty related to future revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to contracts in backlog and unbilled receivables in the japanese yen  the euro  and the german mark  which are undelivered or outstanding at the end of fiscal a hypothetical percent increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in future revenues and asset balances of approximately million 
conversely  a hypothetical percent decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase to future revenues and asset balances of approximately million 
market risk on changes in interest rates the company also experiences interest rate risk on its fixed and variable indebtedness 
mts manages such risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings 
in contrast  interest rate risk on variable rate debt generally does not affect the fair market value of such debt but does impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at september  the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt at september  by approximately thousand 
the impact on variable rate debt would decrease income before income taxes and increase cash outflows for the next year by approximately thousand
