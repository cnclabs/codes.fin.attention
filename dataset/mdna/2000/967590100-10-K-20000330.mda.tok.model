on november   zmax acquired all of the outstanding stock of csi 
through  csi marketed millennium services to a variety of commercial and governmental organizations 
in  csi plans to further develop its expertise with large scale systems in enterprise application integration eai and market those services through the company s widepoint operating subsidiary 
in the next months  the company intends to integrate the services of pmc  eis  and csi into widepoint and pursue other potentially synergistic acquisitions 
further  the company intends to expand the services of all of its subsidiaries through the opening of other offices in key geographic markets 
additionally  the company intends to make investments in the expansion and further development of additional it services and markets 
in view of these investments  the company believes the period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
specifically  as the company increases its investments in other it services  it will incur training  salary and other costs prior to the recognition of related revenues 
in addition  most of the company s revenues are expected to be derived from a relatively small number of large scale  comprehensive projects 
consequently  the company s revenues and operating results may be subject to substantial fluctuations in any given year and from quarter to quarter 
for the year ended december   the company s revenues increased by more than from approximately million in to approximately in previously in  approximately of the company s revenues  or approximately million  were generated from csi s millennium services 
however  in  the company realized a greater amount of revenues from its non millennium it services  which amounted to approximately million  or of revenues  in as compared to only approximately  or of revenues  in as a result of this significant and intended shift in the company s revenues away from millennium services and into other it services  the company believes the period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
most of the company s current cost structure is fixed 
expenses consist primarily of the salaries and benefits paid to the company s technical  marketing and administrative personnel 
amortization and depreciation expenses relate to property  equipment and intangible assets 
as a result of its plan to expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions  the company expects these costs to increase 
the company s profitability depends upon both the volume of service and the company s ability to manage costs 
because a significant portion of the company s cost structure is fixed  the company must effectively manage these costs to achieve profitability 
in addition  certain of the company s projects are priced on a fixed fee basis 
the profitability on an individual fixed fee project depends upon completing the project within the estimated number of staff hours and within the agreed upon time frame 
to date  the company has been able to maintain its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of the company s proprietary software tools  by completing fixed fee projects within budget  by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in consultant fees  and by effectively managing general overhead costs

the market for the company s products is expanding and the company s business environment is characterized by rapid technological changes 
in  the company began to shift away from millennium services and is in the process of consolidating its current subsidiaries and establishing a new operating subsidiary named widepoint 
the company requires substantial working capital to fund these events as well as to fund the future growth of its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  and capital expenditures 
the company currently has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
the company believes that its current cash position is sufficient to meet its capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the near term  however  the company s revenue growth and technological change make it difficult for the company to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
additionally  a major expansion  such as would occur with the acquisition of a significant new subsidiary  might also require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations  as increased costs to the company have generally been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates

actual results may differ materially from projected or expected results due to changes in the demand for the company s products and services  uncertainties relating to the results of operations  dependence on its major customers  risks associated with rapid technological change and the emerging services market  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  and its dependence on key employees and other risks and uncertainties affecting the technology industry generally 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to up date publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
