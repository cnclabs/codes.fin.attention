overview el paso electric company is an electric utility that serves retail customers in west texas and southern new mexico and wholesale customers in texas  new mexico  california and mexico 
the company owns or has substantial ownership interests in five electrical generating facilities providing it with a total capacity of approximately  mw 
the company s energy sources consist of nuclear fuel  natural gas  coal and purchased power 
the company owns or has significant ownership interests in four major kv transmission lines and three kv lines to provide power from palo verde  and owns the distribution network within its retail service territory 
the company is subject to extensive regulation by the texas and new mexico commissions and  with respect to wholesale power sales  transmission of electric power and the issuance of securities  by the ferc 
the company faces a number of risks and challenges that could negatively impact its operations and financial results 
the most significant of these risks and challenges arise from the deregulation of the electric utility industry  the possibility of increased costs  especially from palo verde  and the company s high level of debt 
the electric utility industry in general and the company in particular are facing significant challenges and increased competition as a result of changes in federal provisions relating to third party transmission services and independent power production  as well as changes in state laws and regulatory provisions relating to wholesale and retail service 
both texas and new mexico recently passed legislation that requires the company to separate its transmission and distribution functions from its generation business and mandates competition in the company s retail service territory in the future 
the company faces certain risks inherent in separating the company into affiliates  including the possible loss of operational and administrative efficiencies 
in addition to the operational challenges created by separating functions that have historically operated within a single entity  there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the new mexico legislation will effectively permit the company to recover its stranded costs  including the costs of decommissioning  in full 
the potential effects of deregulation are particularly important to the company because its rates are significantly higher than the national and regional averages 
in the face of increased competition  there can be no assurance that this competition will not adversely affect the future operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company 
the changing regulatory environment and the advent of customer choice have created a substantial risk that the company will lose important customers 
for several years  the company has been engaged in litigation with las cruces  which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  over las cruces attempts to create a municipal utility 
the parties have settled the litigation  but the risk of loss of customers remains 
the company s wholesale and large retail customers already have  in varying degrees  additional alternate sources of economical power  including co generation of electric power 
for example  a mw combined cycle generating plant located in samalayuca  chihuahua  mexico  which became fully operational at the end of  gave cfe the current capacity to supply electricity to portions of northern chihuahua and allowed cfe to eliminate substantially all purchases of power from the company in additionally  american national power  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of national power plc  has announced it is exploring the possibility of building a generation plant in el paso  texas 
if the company loses a significant portion of its retail customer base or wholesale sales  the company may not be able to replace such revenues through either the addition of new customers or an increase in rates to remaining customers 
another risk to the company is potential increased costs  including the risk of additional or unanticipated costs at palo verde resulting from i increases in operation and maintenance expenses  ii the replacement of steam generators  iii an extended outage of any of the palo verde units  iv increases in estimates of decommissioning costs  v the storage of radioactive materials  and vi compliance with the various requirements and regulations governing commercial nuclear generating stations 
at the same time  the company s rates  which have been reduced from previous levels as a result of the new mexico settlement agreement and the texas settlement agreement  are effectively capped through the rate freeze periods 
additionally  upon initiation of competition  there will be competitive pressure on the company s power generation rates 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will be sufficient to recover any increased costs  including any increased costs in connection with palo verde or increases in other costs of operation  whether as a result of higher than anticipated levels of inflation  changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements  or other causes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity requirements in the near term are expected to consist of interest and principal payments on the company s indebtedness  capital expenditures related to the company s generating facilities and transmission and distribution systems and the million payment required under the settlement agreement with las cruces 
the company expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient for such purposes  except that it may be necessary to finance a portion of the las cruces payment in the short term by drawing on its line of credit 
long term capital requirements of the company will consist primarily of construction of electric utility plant and payment of interest on and retirement of debt 
the company has no current plans to construct any new generating capacity to serve retail load through at least utility construction expenditures will consist primarily of expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems and the cost of capital improvements and replacements at palo verde and other generating facilities  including the replacement of the palo verde unit steam generators 
at december   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
in february  the company renewed its million revolving credit facility  which now provides up to million for nuclear fuel purchases and up to million depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding for nuclear fuel purchases for working capital needs 
at december   approximately million had been drawn for nuclear fuel purchases 
no amounts have been drawn on this facility for working capital needs 
the company has a high debt to capitalization ratio and significant debt service obligations 
due to the texas rate stipulation  the texas settlement agreement  the new mexico settlement agreement and competitive pressures  the company does not expect to be able to raise its base rates in the event of increases in non fuel costs  increases in fuel costs in new mexico or loss of revenues 
accordingly  as described below  debt reduction continues to be a high priority for the company in order to gain additional financial flexibility to address the evolving competitive market 
in march  the company used cash on hand to pay for the early redemption of its series a preferred stock  which resulted in the avoidance of additional cash dividends of approximately million that would have been payable through may   and million quarterly thereafter until mandatory redemption in the preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of  which was paid through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock for the first three years of the issue 
the company has significantly reduced its long term debt since its emergence from bankruptcy in from june  through march   the company repurchased approximately million of first mortgage bonds as part of an aggressive deleveraging program and repaid the remaining million of series a first mortgage bonds at their maturity in february the foregoing  together with the early redemption of series a preferred stock  have reduced the company s annual interest expense and annual cash dividend requirements by approximately million and million  respectively 
common stock equity as a percentage of capitalization  excluding current maturities of long term debt  has increased from at june  to at december  in addition  the company s bonds are now rated investment grade by all four major credit rating agencies 
in may  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program allowing the company to purchase outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time  up to a total of six million shares 
the company will make purchases primarily in the open market at prevailing prices and will also engage in private transactions  if appropriate 
the shares that the company acquires will be available for issuance under employee benefit and stock option plans or may be retired 
as of march   the company had repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million  including commissions 
the company continues to believe that the orderly reduction of debt with a goal of achieving a capital structure that is more typical in the electric utility industry is a significant component of long term shareholder value creation 
accordingly  the company will regularly evaluate market conditions and  when appropriate  use a portion of its available cash to reduce its fixed obligations through open market purchases of first mortgage bonds 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences on the company s liquidity  including i the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes could be limited in the future and ii the company s higher than average leverage may place the company at a competitive disadvantage by limiting its financial flexibility to respond to the demands of the competitive market and make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or business changes

there are no new accounting standards pending implementation by the company which would have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding the company s market risk sensitive instruments contains forward looking information involving risks and uncertainties 
the statements regarding potential gains and losses are only estimates of what could occur in the future 
actual future results may differ materially from those estimates presented due to the characteristics of the risks and uncertainties involved 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates  equity prices and commodity prices 
substantially all financial instruments and positions held by the company described below are held for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk relates primarily to debt financing issued to fund capital and nuclear fuel requirements 
currently  the company does not have a plan to issue long term debt within the next five years 
the company s long term debt obligations are all fixed rate obligations with varying maturities  except for the pollution control revenue bonds which are variable rate bonds and nuclear fuel financing which is based on floating rates 
the company s variable rate pollution control revenue bonds have an aggregate principal amount of million 
the near term losses from reasonably possible near term increases in interest rates would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the interest rate risk related to nuclear fuel financing is substantially mitigated through the operation of the company s fuel and purchased power cost recovery clauses fuel clauses in its texas and wholesale rates 
under these fuel clauses  fuel expenses  including interest expense on nuclear fuel financing  are passed through to the customers 
pursuant to the new mexico settlement agreement  fuel costs are recovered through the company s base rates and are not subject to periodic reconciliation for fluctuations in fuel costs 
the near term losses from reasonably possible near term increases in interest rates related to nuclear fuel financing for new mexico fuel costs would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s decommissioning trust funds consist of municipal bonds and equity securities and are carried at their market value 
the company faces interest rate risk related to the municipal bonds  which were valued at million as of december  a hypothetical increase in the rates quoted by the bond market would result in a million reduction in fair value 
equity price risk the company s decommissioning trust funds include marketable equity securities of approximately million at december  a hypothetical decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges would result in a million reduction in fair value 
commodity price risk the company utilizes contracts of various durations for the purchase of natural gas  uranium concentrates and coal to effectively manage its available fuel portfolio 
these agreements contain fixed priced and variable priced provisions and are settled by physical delivery 
the contracts with variable pricing provisions are exposed to fluctuations in prices due to unpredictable factors  such as weather  which impacts supply and demand 
however  the company s exposure to fuel price risk is substantially mitigated through the operation of its fuel clauses for texas and wholesale customers as described above 
pursuant to the new mexico settlement agreement  fuel costs are recovered through the company s base rates and are not subject to periodic reconciliation for fluctuations in fuel costs 
the near term losses from reasonably possible near term increases in market prices as they relate to the commodity price risk exposure for new mexico fuel costs would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  the company utilizes contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchases of electricity to effectively manage its available generating capacity 
such contracts include forward contracts for wholesale sales of generating capacity and energy during periods when the company s available power resources are expected to exceed the requirements of its native load and wholesale customers 
it may also include forward contracts for the purchase of wholesale capacity and energy during periods when the market price of electricity is below the company s expected incremental power production costs 
at december   there were no material open positions in these activities
