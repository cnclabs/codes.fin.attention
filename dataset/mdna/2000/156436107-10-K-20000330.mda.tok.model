management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in view of the company s plans to continue its loan growth with increased emphasis on commercial loans which are generally considered to be more risky than loans secured by real estate  it is likely that the company will continue to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses through future provisions charged to income 
management will continue to closely monitor the performance of the loan portfolio and make additional provisions as considered necessary 
no assurance can be given that such provisions will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in future periods 
noninterest income noninterest income for was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  in this increase resulted largely from growth of fees earned in the credit card program  increases in service charges on deposit accounts  commissions from a new mortgage loan origination program  as well as other commissions and other fee income

the increase in was due largely to increases in salaries and employee benefits of  and data processing services of  these increases in salaries and employee benefits reflect the opening of the dumfries branch office in october  a full year of compensation expense for the employees at the branch opened in  the addition of personnel to support growth in the loan portfolio  and a reduction in the amount of loan origination costs deferred in the current year 
the increases in the cost of data processing services were primarily attributable to growth in the credit card program  additional transaction volume  and efforts to prepare for and comply with year readiness issues 
noninterest expense was  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in was attributable to increased occupancy and equipment expenses of  professional fees of  data processing services of  and other operating expenses of  these increases were primarily attributable to the opening of three new branch offices in maryland and virginia in and  the corresponding growth in the loan portfolio  and efforts to prepare for and comply with year readiness issues 
the company s noninterest expense has been consistently higher in relation to its asset size than the average for small community banks 
the company s strategy is to increase its asset size significantly so that its level of noninterest expense in relation to its assets is more in line with those of comparable institutions 
no assurance may be given  however  that the anticipated asset growth or branch expansions will occur

interest rate sensitivity and management of market risk net interest income  which constitutes one of the principal sources of income for the company  represents the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the difference between the company s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities for a specified time frame is referred to as an interest sensitive gap 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a financial institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a financial institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets 
during a period of rising falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to increase decrease net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to decrease increase net interest income 
management seeks to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position to protect its net interest margin from market fluctuations 
toward this end  the company maintains an asset liability committee alco which reviews  on a regular basis  the maturity and repricing of the assets and liabilities of the company 
alco has adopted the objective of achieving and maintaining a one year cumulative gap  as a percent of total assets  of between plus and minus 
on a consolidated basis  the company s one year cumulative gap was a negative of total assets at december  in addition  alco monitors potential changes in net interest income  net income and the market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  arising primarily from interest rate risk in the company s loan and investment portfolios  which can significantly impact the company s profitability 
net interest income can be adversely impacted where assets and liabilities do not react the same to changes in interest rates 
at year end  the impact of an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income over a month period of  with a comparable decrease in interest rates resulting in an increase in net interest income of 
management finds the above methodologies meaningful for evaluating market risk sensitivity  however  other factors can affect net interest income  such as levels of non earning assets and changes in portfolio composition 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of the company at december   which are expected to mature or are subject to repricing in each of the time periods indicated interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities dollars in thousands days to days over term to repricing at december  or less days to year year total interest earning assets loans  net      investment securities    federal funds sold   interest bearing deposits with banks     total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now accounts   savings accounts   money market accounts    time deposits      other borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap per period    cumulative gap   cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percent of interest bearing liabilities analysis of financial condition loans the company presently is  and in the future expects to remain  a middle market banking organization serving professionals and businesses with interests in and around the washington  dc metropolitan area 
as of december  and  approximately million and million of the company s total loan portfolio  respectively  consisted of loans secured by real estate  of which one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit represented million and million  respectively  of the company s total loan portfolio 
loan concentrations are defined as aggregate credits extended to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or resident in the same geographic region  which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions 
the company  on a routine basis  evaluates these concentrations for purposes of policing its concentrations and making necessary adjustments in its lending practices to reflect current economic conditions  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
as a result of the company s existing branch locations  the company has significant concentrations of customers and assets in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
the primary types of loans in the company s portfolio are residential mortgages and home equity loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and consumer installment and credit card loans 
generally  the company underwrites loans based upon the borrower s debt service capacity or cash flow  a consideration of past performance on loans from other creditors as well as an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan 
with some exceptions  the company s general policy is to require conservative underwriting policies  primarily in the analysis of borrowers debt service coverage capabilities for commercial and commercial real estate loans  while emphasizing lower gross debt ratios for consumer loans and lower loan to value ratios for all types of real estate loans 
most of the company s commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied properties financed for the company s regular commercial customers  rather than speculative or investor owned properties 
most of the company s commercial and commercial real estate loans are personally guaranteed by the owners of the business  the primary exceptions to this requirement being loans to non profit and membership organizations 
given the localized nature of the company s lending activities  the primary risk factor affecting the portfolio as a whole is the health of the local economy in the washington  dc metropolitan area and its effects on the value of local real estate and the incomes of local professionals and business firms 
to mitigate this risk  the company s underwriting policy provides that each loan should be supported by an economically independent secondary source of repayment 
any exceptions to the general loan policy must be approved by the executive loan committee 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders of the company and to directors and officers of the bank are subject to limitations contained in the federal reserve act  the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and ten percent stockholders satisfy certain standards 
the bank routinely makes loans in the ordinary course of business to certain directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates  and members of their immediate families 
in accordance with federal reserve act guidelines  these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable transactions with others and do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
as of december   loans and commitments outstanding to directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates and members of their immediate families totaled million net of participations sold to other banks on a non recourse basis  which represented approximately percent of total loans as of that date 
as of december   none of these loans outstanding from the bank to related parties were on non accrual  past due  restructured or considered by management to be a potential problem loan

asset quality nonperforming assets generally  interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based upon the principal balance outstanding 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify a loan as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection  or when  in the opinion of management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation 
the company will generally charge off loans after days of delinquency unless adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  management believes that the loan will be repaid or brought current within a reasonable period of time 
loans will not be returned to accrual status until the loan has been brought current and future payments of principal and interest appear certain 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance until the status of the loan has changed 
real estate acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned oreo 
such loans are reclassified to oreo and recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value less estimated selling costs  and the estimated loss  if any  is charged to the allowance for credit losses at that time 
further allowances for losses are recorded as charges to other expenses at the time management believes additional deterioration in value has occurred

allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon  among other things  such factors as historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the company  the amount of nonperforming assets  regulatory policies  generally accepted accounting principles  general economic conditions  and other factors related to the collectibility of loans in the company s portfolio 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses  future adjustments may be necessary if such factors and conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations

in considering the loss potential associated with different types of loans  the company considers its own historical loss experience with each type of loan  together with any internal or external changes which might suggest that future losses will be higher or lower than the historical loss experience 
such additional factors include changes in national or local economic conditions which affect the repayment capacity of borrowers and or the market value of collateral  trends in past due payments  changes in underwriting standards  changes in loan originating and servicing personnel  changes in the types of credit offered  and other factors

year general 
the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the failure of the company  its vendors or its borrowers to address these issues could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
state of readiness 
in december  the company adopted a year compliance plan yk plan for the assessment of its exposure to the year problem  completion of any required remediation  and testing of systems compliance 
a specific timetable was established  and a senior officer of the company was assigned leadership responsibility

costs of compliance 
as part of its yk plan  the company spent approximately  for the replacement of outdated computer hardware and software 
much of these expenditures would have been incurred in the ordinary course of business to maintain such computer systems  regardless of year problem considerations 
the human resources requirement included the time of regular company employees  a network administration consultant  and approximately  of additional consulting expenses 
the costs to address the company s year issues have not had a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
while the company does not believe that it will incur any additional material expenses related to the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will not be impacted by a year related problem which occurs after the date hereof or by the failure of a third party to achieve proper year compliance 
transition into the year the company suffered no failures in any system or product upon the date change from december  to january  in addition  management is not aware of any vendor used by the company for data processing or related services which experienced a material failure of its product or service due to a year related problem 
the company was also subject to risks associated with year noncompliance by customers of the bank 
management is not aware of any customer which suffered losses related to a year problem which would adversely affect that customer s financial condition or its ability to repay any outstanding loan it has from the bank 
ongoing plans 
although many of the critical dates related to potential year related problems have passed  some experts predict that year related failures could occur throughout the year  such as on february  and december  accordingly  the company s year project team will continue to monitor the company s it and non it systems and attempt to identify any potential problems during the course of the year 
in addition  the company will continue to monitor the year compliance of the third parties  with which the company transacts business  for delayed effects or future problems 
contingency plans

the company believes that any mission critical systems could be recovered and operating within seven days 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks  and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the company and its results of operations are not predictable
