general we provide marine construction services to the oil and gas industry primarily in the gulf of mexico and selected international locations 
our marine fleet installs pipelines to transport oil and gas from newly installed production platforms and other subsea production systems  and installs and salvages production platforms and other marine structures 
our present management team assumed its current role in july and has aggressively expanded horizon s operations 
this management team has assembled a fleet of eleven vessels capable of providing a full range of pipeline and derrick services in varying water depths 
we currently operate ten of these vessels  consisting of five pipelay pipebury barges  a dedicated pipebury barge  two derrick barges and two diving support vessels 
we acquired two vessels in to expand our services 
the brazos horizon  a foot  pipelay pipebury barge was purchased in april for million  which consisted of million in cash and  shares of common stock  with a fair value of million 
treasury stock was reissued in this transaction 
in may  we acquired the pacific horizon  a foot pipebury barge 
we reconfigured the pacific horizon as a derrick barge by removing the pipebury equipment and installing an ton revolving crane 
the pacific horizon was available for operations in march the crane was upgraded to a lift capacity from tons to  tons in march the demand for offshore construction services in the gulf depends largely on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction 
these expenditures are influenced by prevailing oil and gas prices  expectations about future demand and prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and abroad  political and economic conditions  governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital 
historically  oil and gas prices and the level of exploration and development activity have fluctuated substantially  impacting the demand for pipeline and marine construction services 
factors affecting our profitability include competition  equipment and labor productivity  contract estimating  weather conditions and the other risks inherent in marine construction 
the marine construction industry in the gulf is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions with the greatest demand for these services occurring during the second and third calendar quarters of the year 
full year results are not a direct multiple of any quarter or combination of quarters because of this seasonality 
a prolonged weakness in energy prices or a prolonged period of lower levels of offshore drilling and exploration could adversely affect future revenues and profitability 
in  we experienced a decline in demand for marine construction services in the gulf  as oil and gas companies reduced their levels of capital expenditures 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations contract revenues 
contract revenues were million for compared with million for revenues for decreased due to reduced demand for offshore construction services 
we operated ten vessels in  compared to eight vessels operating in december we laid miles and buried miles of pipe of various diameters and in various water depths in the gulf during  compared to approximately miles laid and miles buried in we recognized million in revenues in and million in for the stephaniturm charter to dsnd 
gross profit 
gross profit was million of contract revenues for as compared with a gross profit of million of contract revenues for lower gross profit for was primarily attributable to the lower level of offshore construction and the intense price competition for pipeline projects 
we recognized gross profit of million in and million in from the stephaniturm charter to dsnd 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of contract revenues for from million of contract revenues for  primarily due to expenses associated with our fleet expansion 
the percentage increase was primarily due to the decrease in revenues while selling general and administrative expenses increased 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  net of million interest capitalized for  compared with interest expense of million  net of million interest capitalized for total outstanding debt was million at december  compared to million at year end the outstanding debt increased during as a result of increasing debt to fund vessel acquisitions and improvements 
interest income and other 
interest income and other consisted of  of interest income   of insurance proceeds and  of miscellaneous income for interest income and other consisted of  of interest income and  of miscellaneous income for income taxes

as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income was million or per share for the year ended december   compared to net income of million or per share for the year ended december  the reduction of net income is primarily the result of reduced demand for offshore construction in the gulf during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations the operating results are not comparable to results due to substantial growth in the size and operating capabilities of our fleet 
the vessel acquisitions expanded our operating capabilities and increased the operating cost structure in the aggregate amount of selling  general and administrative expenses increased to support this growth 
contract revenues 
contract revenues were million for compared with million for revenues increased because we operated two vessels  the american horizon and the cajun horizon  for the entire year in compared with eight vessels in operation by june all eight vessels were operational for the last six months of severe weather conditions in the gulf in the third quarter of caused construction and scheduling delays and adversely impacted equipment productivity and profit margins 
we laid miles and buried miles of pipe of various diameters and in various water depths in the gulf during compared with approximately miles of pipe laid and buried in in  we recognized million in revenues from the charter hire of the stephaniturm to dsnd 
gross profit 
gross profit was million of contract revenues for as compared with a gross profit of million of contract revenues for higher revenues and gross profit for were primarily attributable to the increased number of vessels that were deployed during this period 
in  we recognized million in gross profit from the stephaniturm charter to dsnd 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of contract revenues for from million of contract revenues for primarily due to the addition of personnel and other expenses associated with the growth and fleet expansion 
the percentage decrease was primarily due to the significant increase in revenues without a commensurate increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  net of million interest capitalized for and million  net of million interest capitalized for the total outstanding debt was million at december   compared with million at year end the outstanding debt increased significantly during the fourth quarter of and throughout as a result of the vessel acquisitions and improvements and the acquisition of the marine base in port arthur  texas 
the increase in indebtedness was partially offset by the repayment of million of outstanding subordinated notes from the initial public offering proceeds 
gain on sale of assets 
in december  we sold our marine base in houma  louisiana to an unaffiliated third party for million in cash resulting in a  gain 
in february  we sold one of our vessels to an unaffiliated third party for million in cash resulting in a million gain 
income taxes 
horizon uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we utilized net operating loss carryforwards that offset income taxes in and at least partially offset income taxes in we recorded federal income tax expense of million  at a net effective rate of on pre tax income of million in we did not have a valuation allowance at december  due to taxable income for for  both pre tax and net income were million  as no income tax expense was recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance was established to offset the net deferred tax assets  including those related to carryforwards  to the extent they were not realizable through the sale of appreciated assets at december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income was million or per share for the year ended december   compared with net income for of million or per share 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of the significant increase in revenues and gross profit generated by our expanded fleet 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund acquisitions and improvements to the fleet necessary to expand operations and to provide working capital 
cash provided by operations was million for  million for and million for the improvement in cash provided by operations during was the result of a decline in working capital attributable to decreases in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings 
horizon had working capital of million at december  compared to working capital of million at december  reduced demand for offshore construction in caused revenues to decrease from million in to million in  and caused a decline in working capital 
in december  horizon entered into a term loan agreement with the cit group  inc providing for a million term loan at a rate of libor plus 
we initially borrowed million in december and repaid the million total outstanding debt balance under a prior credit facility with den norske bank and a million note payable to a subsidiary of one of our principal stockholders 
during  the term loan was amended to increase the amount that may be borrowed to million  and we borrowed an additional million 
the outstanding balance of the term loan at december  was million 
the first advance of million under the term loan is due in monthly principal installments of  the second advance of million is due in monthly principal installments of  the third advance of million is due in monthly principal installments of  and the fourth advance of million is due in monthly installments of  the remaining principal balance is due at the end of the months 
the term loan is secured by mortgages on all owned vessels 
we have a million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank at libor plus 
at december   we had million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under the million revolving credit facility 
we had million available based on the borrowing base calculation 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at libor plus and are secured by the accounts receivable from customers 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  the term loan and revolving credit facility require that certain conditions be met in order for us to obtain advances 
the term loan is secured by mortgages on all owned vessels 
the revolving credit facility is secured by accounts receivable 
advances under the credit facility may be obtained in accordance with a borrowing base defined as a percentage of accounts receivable balances 
both the term loan and revolving credit facility contain customary defaults and require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
the facilities also contain certain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  create certain liens  sell assets and make capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during totaled million compared with million for and million for we have expanded our fleet from two vessels at the beginning of to eleven vessels by the end of we have financed our vessel and property acquisitions and improvements through operating cash flow and borrowings 
planned capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to complete improvements to the existing fleet 
current maturities of long term debt were million as of december  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the planned capital projects  debt payments and working capital requirements for our strategy  however  is to make other acquisitions to expand our operating capabilities and expand into selected international areas 
to the extent we are successful in identifying acquisition opportunities  we may require additional equity or debt financing depending on the size of any transaction
