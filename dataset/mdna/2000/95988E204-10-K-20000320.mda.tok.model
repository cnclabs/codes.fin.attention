overview the company provides cellular communications services in western states under the cellular one brand name principally through the ownership and operation of cellular wireless systems 
the operations are primarily in rural areas due to the company s belief that there are certain strategic advantages to operating in these areas 
the company owns fcc licenses to provide such services in msas and rsas 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  holding co 
owns of wwi which holds non controlling interests in entities which own wireless licenses in nine foreign countries 
as of december  wwi interests covered a proportional population of million and had  proportional subscribers 
the company had an controlling interest in voicestream  an entity that provides wireless communication services through the ownership and operation of pcs licenses 
on may   voicestream was formally separated from the company the spin off 
as of that date  the company distributed all of its interest in voicestream to its shareholders 
although voicestream has been operated separately from the company s other operations and has been a separate legal entity since its inception  the spin off established voicestream as a stand alone entity with objectives separate from those of the company 
for additional information regarding the spin off  see the company s information statement filed with the sec on form c dated april  during the second quarter  as a result of the spin off  the company recognized compensation expense on all options outstanding as of may  on the date of the spin off  the company cancelled and reissued all outstanding options 
all reissued stock options were granted in a manner that ensured employees of both the company and voicestream maintained the value of their options  subject to normal fluctuations in the price of both companies stock  after the spin off 
this reissuance did not accelerate any benefits to option holders 
the company believes this allowed employees to continue to better participate in the success of the company for which they work 
as outlined in the provisions of eitf the company recorded deferred compensation of approximately million and compensation expense for those options in which the service period had passed of million 
revenues for the company consist primarily of subscriber revenues including access charges and usage charges  roamer revenues and equipment sales 
the majority of revenues are derived from subscriber revenues 
service revenues includes monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges derived from calls placed by the company s customers and other charges such as activations  voice mail  call waiting  and call forwarding 
roaming revenues are revenues that result from providing service to subscribers of other wireless providers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
roaming revenues typically yield higher average per minute rates and higher margins than subscriber revenues 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by long term agreement between the company and the roamer s wireless provider 
as used herein  service revenues include subscriber  roamer and other revenue 
other revenues consist primarily of paging revenues 
equipment sales consist of wireless handset and accessory sales to customers 
the company sells handsets below cost and regards these losses as a cost of building its subscriber base 
cost of service consists of the cost of providing wireless service to subscribers  primarily costs to access local exchange and long distance carrier facilities and to maintain the wireless network 
general and administrative expenses are principally variable costs based on the average number of subscribers 
general and administrative costs include the costs associated with billing a subscriber and the administrative costs associated with maintaining subscribers  including customer service  accounting and other centralized functions 
general and administrative expenses also include provisions for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges and subscriber bad debt 
sales and marketing costs include costs associated with acquiring a subscriber  including direct and indirect sales commissions  salaries  all costs of retail locations  advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing costs do not include the revenue or costs of handset sales 
however  when sales and marketing costs per net subscriber addition are discussed  the revenue and costs from handset sales are included because such measure is commonly used in the wireless industry 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation expense associated with the property and equipment in service and amortization associated with its wireless licenses for operational markets 
the financial statements include an allocation of certain centralized costs to voicestream and its affiliates  prior to and subsequent to the spin off 
such centralized items include the costs of shared senior management  customer care operations and certain back office functions 
these costs have been allocated to voicestream and its affiliates in a manner that reflects the relative time devoted to each 
ebitda represents operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
management believes ebitda provides meaningful additional information on the company s operating results and on its ability to service its long term debt and other fixed obligations  and to fund the company s continued growth 
ebitda is considered by many financial analysts to be a meaningful indicator of an entity s ability to meet its future financial obligations  and growth in ebitda is considered to be an indicator of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as wireless telecommunications 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with united states gaap  as an alternate to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of liquidity 
because ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies  the company s presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
results of operations for the years ended december    and the company had  subscribers at december   a increase during the company had  subscribers at december   a increase in the company had  subscribers at december   a increase during the net number of subscribers added through system acquisitions was approximately  in   in  and  in the following table sets forth certain financial data as it relates to the company s   and operations dollars in thousands year ended december  change change revenues subscriber revenues    roamer revenues    equipment sales and other revenues    total revenues    operating expenses cost of service    cost of equipment sales    general and administrative    sales and marketing    depreciation and amortization    stock based compensation  nm total operating expenses    other expense    net loss from continuing operations  nm  nm  ebitda    cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities  nm   financing activities  nm   revenues the increase in subscriber revenues each year is primarily due to the growth in the number of subscribers offset slightly by a decrease in the average monthly subscriber revenue per subscriber arpu 
arpu was in  a decline from in  which was a decline from in the company continues to focus on attracting new customers with rate plans that provide more value to the customer at a higher average access charge 
management feels this strategy will provide relative stability in arpu in future periods 
further  over the past few years the cellular industry as a whole has also shown a decline in arpu 
the increase in roamer revenues over the past three years was caused by an increase in roaming traffic on the company s network and partially offset by a decrease in the rates charged between carriers 
a significant portion of the increase is driven by the growth in roamer minutes as a result of the company s strategy  implemented in  to become the roamer carrier of choice for other carriers 
roamer revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in  compared to for and for while the company expects total roamer minutes to continue to increase  the decline in the rates charged between carriers may limit the growth of roamer revenues 
equipment sales increased each year due to the growth in subscriber additions 
further  average phone and accessory revenue per item sold increased compared to and also  the mix of high end handsets with more features continues to comprise a larger portion of overall handset sales 
operating expenses the increase in cost of service each year is primarily attributable to the increased number of subscribers and an increase in the average minutes of use per subscriber 
while cost of service increased in total dollars  it decreased as a percentage of service revenues to in from in and in the decrease as a percentage of service revenues is due mainly to service revenues growing at a faster rate than the fixed cost of service components 
the company expects cost of service dollars to continue to increase in future periods as a result of the growing subscriber base and the increase in other carriers customers roaming on its network 
however  the cost of service as a percentage of service revenues is expected to continue to decline as greater economies of scale are realized 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the increase in costs associated with supporting a larger subscriber base 
for the year ended december   the company s general and administrative monthly cost per average subscriber increased to in from in and in the increase is due partly to additional headquarter costs resulting from lost cost efficiencies as a result of the spin off 
in addition  the company incurred pre operating costs related to ireland with no corresponding additions in subscribers  as the ireland market is not yet operational 
management anticipates improved cost efficiencies to be realized on a per subscriber basis in future periods due to cost reductions expected with the implementation of a new billing system in the next fiscal year 
increases in sales and marketing costs each year are primarily due to the increase in net subscriber additions 
during the sales and marketing cost per net subscriber added  including the loss on equipment sales  remained relatively flat at compared to in but increased from in this increase from to is largely due to a growth in disconnected subscribers causing the increase in costs to be spread over a similar amount of net subscriber additions 
the growth in disconnected subscribers is a result of a similar churn rate representing customer attrition applied to a larger subscriber base 
cost of equipment sales increased each year due to the increase in the number of handsets sold  offset by a decrease in the average cost of handsets sold 
the company expects that the cost for its handsets will decrease at a slower rate or level off in future years 
although subscribers generally are responsible for purchasing or otherwise obtaining their own handsets  the company has historically sold handsets below cost to respond to competition and general industry practice and expects to continue to do so in the future 
increases in depreciation and amortization expense over the past three years are primarily due to the acquisition of additional wireless communications system assets 
as the company continues to expand and upgrade its wireless footprint and systems  management anticipates depreciation and amortization expense will increase in future periods 
the stock based compensation results mainly from the cancellation and reissuance of employee stock options as a result of the spin off  as previously discussed 
in addition  stock appreciation rights sars issued by wwi contributed approximately million to the overall charge in ebitda the increase in ebitda is primarily a result of increased revenues due to the increased subscriber base and the related cost efficiencies gained 
as a result  operating margin ebitda as a percentage of service revenues increased to in from in and in net loss from continuing operations from to  the increase in net loss from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases in stock based compensation and other expenses 
from to  the increase in net loss from continuing operations is primarily attributable to the increase in other expenses  offset by an improvement in operating income 
the company expects continued improvement in operating income in other income expense  net operating loss carryforwards interest and financing expense increased to million in from million in and million in due to the increase in average long term debt 
long term debt was incurred primarily to fund the company s acquisition of wireless properties and to fund international projects through wwi 
the weighted average interest rate was in  in  and in the company had available at december   net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million which will expire in the years through the company may be limited in its ability to use these carryforwards in any one year due to ownership changes that preceded the business combination that formed the company in july management believes that  based on a number of factors  there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of the company s nol carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a credit facility the credit facility with a consortium of lenders providing for million of revolving credit and term loans in aggregate of million 
as of december    million was outstanding under the credit facility 
indebtedness under the credit facility matures on march   and bears interest at variable rates 
substantially all the assets of the company are pledged as security for such indebtedness 
the terms of the credit facility restrict  among other things  the sale of assets  distribution of dividends or other distributions and loans 
amounts available for borrowing at december   which are limited by certain financial covenants and other restrictions  were million under the term loans and must be fully drawn by may  the company has issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes at par and million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes at par 
indebtedness under the notes and notes matures in june  and february   respectively 
the credit facility prohibits the repayment of all or any portion of the principal amounts of the notes or notes prior to the repayment of all indebtedness under the credit facility 
the notes and notes contain certain restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the operations and activities of the company and certain of its subsidiaries  including the issuance of other indebtedness  the creation of liens  the sale of assets  issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and certain investments and acquisitions 
the company obtained the appropriate waivers from the holders of these notes prior to consummation of the spin off at a cost of million 
on march   the company signed a commitment letter to secure billion in new financing consisting of a combination of revolving and term loans 
final terms and conditions of this arrangement are contingent upon the approval of the new financing among the syndicate of lenders 
the new financing arrangement is expected to have terms and conditions similar to the existing credit facility 
proceeds from the new financing arrangement will be used to repay the company s existing credit facility 
assuming the new financing is established  the company will recognize an extraordinary loss ranging from approximately to million for the impairment of existing deferred financing costs relating to the company s current debt structure 
through the end of  the company anticipates spending significant capital resources for the acquisition of wireless assets and the continued development of its existing infrastructure 
in  the company expects to spend approximately million for the continued expansion of its cellular infrastructure  million for the implementation of a new billing system and back office infrastructure and approximately million for the purchase of the cellular licenses and operations of the utah  wyoming and arizona rsas 
capital spending during will allow for expanded minutes of use by the company s subscribers as well as from other carriers customers roaming on its wireless network 
in addition  the company anticipates it will continue to be a significant source of funding for international projects through its subsidiary wwi 
the company will utilize operating cash flow  the credit facility and other sources of funding  for purposes of funding its cellular and other activities 
on may   the company distributed to its stockholders its entire interest in voicestream 
prior to the spin off  the company had received a ruling from the irs to the effect that the spin off would not result in the recognition of income or gain by the company or its stockholders 
notwithstanding the ruling  however  the company would recognize gain as a result of the spin off if the spin off is part of a prohibited plan  that is  a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire  directly or indirectly  percent or more of the company s or voicestream s stock 
a prohibited plan is presumed to exist if one or more persons acquire  directly or indirectly  percent or more of the company s or voicestream s stock during the four year period that begins two years before the spin off 
in february  voicestream completed its merger with omnipoint  pursuant to which a newly formed holding company acquired all of the outstanding stock of voicestream and omnipoint in exchange for stock of the holding company and cash 
on september   voicestream entered into an agreement with aerial  pursuant to which the holding company will acquire all of the outstanding stock of aerial  again in exchange for stock of the holding company and cash 
either of these transactions  when completed  could give rise to the rebuttable presumption that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan 
in conjunction with the spin off  voicestream agreed to indemnify the company on an after tax basis for any taxes imposed on the company if an acquisition of voicestream s stock causes the spin off to be part of a prohibited plan 
as a result  if the proposed omnipoint and aerial transactions fail to overcome the rebuttable presumption  the company believes that voicestream would be responsible for the company s resulting tax liability arising from the spin off 
although the issue is not free from doubt  the company believes that the omnipoint and aerial transactions are not part of a prohibited plan 
even if it is ultimately determined that such transactions were part of a prohibited plan  the company believes that voicestream is capable of funding the resulting indemnity obligation to the company 
in february  a subsidiary of hutchison telecommunications limited htl purchased of the outstanding capital stock of voicestream for an aggregate purchase price of million the hutchison investment 
approximately million of the proceeds were paid to the company as a repayment of advances made to voicestream and were used by the company to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
adjustments to the million net loss to reconcile to net cash used in operating activities primarily included million of depreciation and amortization  million for the net loss from discontinued operations  million for employee equity compensation and million for the equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates due to the increase in activity in international investments 
other adjustments included changes in operating assets and liabilities  including i an increase of million in net accounts receivable  due primarily to increased revenues  and ii an increase of million in prepaid and other current assets mainly related to international investment activity 
net cash used in operating activities was million in and million in investing activities consisted primarily of i purchases of property and equipment of million  ii investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of million  primarily attributable to advances to international joint ventures  iii a return of investment from voicestream wireless of million  and iv million for acquisition of wireless properties in  which consists primarily of the company s purchase of the cellular licenses and operations of the wyoming and oklahoma rsas  brownsville  tx and mcallen tx msas  and texas and arkansas rsas in the first  second  and fourth quarters of  respectively 
financing activities consisted primarily of a net addition to long term debt of million 
in the ordinary course of business  the company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities  joint ventures and other potential business transactions 
such acquisitions  joint ventures and business transactions may be material 
such transactions may also require the company to seek additional sources of funding through the issuance of additional debt and or additional equity at the parent or subsidiary level 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the company on acceptable or favorable terms 
seasonality the company  and the wireless communications industry in general  have historically experienced significant subscriber growth during the fourth calendar quarter 
accordingly  during such quarter the company experiences greater losses on equipment sales and increases in sales and marketing expenses 
the company has historically experienced highest usage and revenue per subscriber during the summer months 
the company expects these trends to continue 
year the company  like most businesses  modified significant portions of its information technology it and non it systems so that they will function properly in the year much of the company s technology  including technology associated with its critical systems  is purchased from third parties 
the company is dependent on those third parties to assess the impact of the year issue on the technology and services they supply and to take any necessary corrective action 
the company has incurred internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to complete the remediation of its systems for the year the by product of this effort was that the company had year compliant hardware and software running on all of its major platforms 
the incremental costs for the year remediation efforts have been insignificant 
the company s it and non it systems successfully transitioned to the year however  there may be latent problems that surface at key dates or events in the future 
the company has not experienced  and does not anticipate  any significant problems related to the transition to the year that would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and financial condition of the company 
furthermore  the company does not anticipate any significant expenditure in the future related to year compliance
