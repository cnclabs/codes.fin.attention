year implications 
introduction 
the company is aware of issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium approaches 
in particular  software applications that use only two digits to identify a year in the date field may fail or create errors in the year year issues 
year issues create risk for the company from unforeseen problems in computer systems that the company sells to customers on a nationwide basis which are used  among other things  to process their financial transactions and schedule patients company products  as well as systems that the company uses internally to provide certain services to its customers and to process its own financial transactions internal use systems 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with year issues will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s proprietary and third party developed software  hardware hardware and third party developed software will hereinafter be referred to collectively as third party products and the nature of the industry in which the company operates 
company products and third party products sold by the company may fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
such failures could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of customers operations  including among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  schedule and treat patients or engage in similar normal business activities 
further  products and services used by the company s customers  but not supplied by the company  could fail to operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
customers efforts to plan for such events could result in the deferral  delay or cancellation by customers of current installations of and plans to purchase systems from the company 
similarly  internal use systems  including both information systems and non information systems  may not operate properly or as expected due to year issues 
year issues could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of the company s operations  including among other things  an inability to process its own and certain of its customers financial transactions  send invoices  conduct communications  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company cannot be sure that year issues will not affect its business 
thus far  the company has incurred no materially adverse problems related to year issues associated with the computer systems  software  other property and equipment we use 
however  the company cannot guarantee that year issues will not adversely affect its business  operating results or financial condition at some point in the future 
state of readiness 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to address year issues 
the company has identified individuals and or working groups to develop and implement the company s definition of year readiness  assess company products  third party products and internal use systems for possible year issues  monitor development  testing and remediation efforts with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems  monitor and coordinate the company s deployment plans and results with respect to year releases of company products  third party products and internal use systems  and  develop contingency plans with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems 
although the company s efforts to address year issues do not fall precisely into sequential phases  generally these efforts are comprised of an assessment phase  a development phase only with respect to company products and certain proprietary internal use systems  a deployment or remediation phase  and a contingency planning phase 
company products 
the nextgen suite of applications and cps are designed to be year compliant and contain no known year issues when configured and used in accordance with the related documentation  and provided that the underlying operating system of the host machine and any other software used with or in the host machine are also year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that such products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year issues 
the company s legacy product has required significant development and remediation efforts in connection with year issues with many of these efforts commencing in the company completed its development efforts in connection with year issues associated with the legacy product and certain associated ancillary products during calendar also during calendar  the company completed deployment of version of its legacy product which has been designed to be year compliant 
third party products sold by the company 
the company works closely with vendors of significant third party products sold by the company and has communicated with them to determine the extent to which their products and services are  or will be  year compliant 
in addition  company products have been tested  and the company plans to continue testing company products  with certain third party products 
based upon its current assessments  the company believes that it has received adequate assurances that significant third party product vendors expect to successfully address their significant identified year issues on a timely basis 
due to uncertainties associated with third party product vendors  the company is unable to predict whether a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition may result form year issues related to third party products despite the company s current assessment to the contrary 
internal use systems 
based upon the company s assessment efforts to date  the company believes that its critical internal use systems are year compliant 
certain of the internal use systems are proprietary and were developed by the company 
company personnel have used similar techniques to identify year issues with its company products and proprietary internal use systems 
the proprietary internal use systems have either been modified by company personnel or replaced with third party developed systems which the company believes will not fail as a result of year issues 
the company has communicated with developers and or vendors of certain of its third party developed internal use systems to determine the extent to which those products and services are year compliant 
based upon its current assessments  the company believes that it has received adequate assurances that critical third party developed internal use systems are year compliant 
contingency plans 
the company is currently engaged in contingency planning to address company wide personnel  resource  technical and communication matters in connection with foreseeable scenarios that may develop from year issues despite the company s remediation efforts 
the company expects that its development  remediation  testing  deployment and contingency planning efforts with respect to company products  third party products and internal use systems will continue up to and beyond march  the company s contingency planning includes possible failure by the company and its vendors to complete efforts to avoid or minimize the impact of year issues on a timely basis  failure of customers to be ready for  or cooperate with  the deployment of year compliant company products on a timely basis  and  delay  deferral or cancellation by customers of current installations and prospective purchase decisions with respect to company products 
a reasonably likely worst case scenario has not yet been identified  but it is anticipated that such scenario would include the failure of significant communications and computing infrastructures by the company  its customers and its suppliers together with failures of infrastructures encompassing utilities  transportation  banking and government 
costs 
the total cost to address the company s year issues were not material to the company s financial condition 
the company does not separately track all of its internal personnel costs incurred in connection with identifying and resolving year issues 
excluding internal costs  total expenditures to address year issues were less than  all of these expenditures have been funded from operations
