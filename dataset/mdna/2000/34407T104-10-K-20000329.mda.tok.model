the company believes that the future of the regional airline industry lies in utilizing regional and feeder jets to complement and feed the major carriers 
to this end  in addition to the crjs in service as of march   the company has firm  conditional and option orders for crjs and frjs and long term marketing agreements with united airlines  inc and delta air lines  inc 
to fly the jet aircraft as united express and delta connection  respectively 
the addition of these jets will allow the company to grow capacity as measured in asm s  based on planned aircraft delivery dates  by approximately in and in the company also believes that multiple marketing agreements will enable the company to reduce reliance on any one major airline  and will enhance and stabilize operating results through a combination of pro rate and fee per departure revenue opportunities 
acjet has targeted the commencement of revenue service with frjs during the second quarter of and with crjs during the fourth quarter of acjet is presently engaged in pre operating activities including regulatory compliance  employee recruitment  training  establishment of operating infrastructure  establishment of third party contractual arrangements  and aircraft proving runs 
in the first quarter of acjet was issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the dot 
the effectiveness of the dot certificate is conditioned upon the issuance by the faa of an operating certificate to acjet  an application for which is pending 
in order to obtain faa approval  acjet must demonstrate that it has the necessary organization and technical ability to safely provide air transportation  and must satisfy certain environmental requirements 
acjet will also need to satisfy regulatory requirements with respect to crjs prior to adding this aircraft type to its fleet later in the year 
there can be no assurance that all required approvals will be granted to acjet on a timely basis 
acjet has accepted delivery of an interim jet aircraft  which is being utilized for proving runs and training 
the first two permanent jet aircraft are scheduled for delivery in late april acjet anticipates incurring approximately million in start up expenses from inception through commencement of revenue service  which will be expensed as incurred 
a number of business and regulatory developments are affecting the markets in which the company competes 
during the first half of us airways began to expand its operations at washington dulles 
new service included the operations of mainline us airways  metrojet  shuttle and us airways express 
us airways operated in five of the company s washington dulles markets as of december  and by september  increased their presence to of the company s markets 
although the us airways service generally has utilized fare levels similar to that implemented by the company  two of the implemented markets were served by metrojet  which offered fares lower than that typically offered by the company 
during april and may   united significantly increased the number of flights it operated at washington dulles 
in july   united and the company revised their dulles flight schedules to increase connections and to thereby take greater advantage of united s increased capacity 
as of march   united operated daily departures from washington dulles  a increase from december  during  the company and united either increased frequencies or upgraded equipment  or both  in markets affected by the us airways expansion 
in the first quarter of  us airways began reducing some of its metrojet  shuttle and us airways express operations at washington dulles 
reductions were made in the operations of metrojet  shuttle and us airways express 
by march us airways ceased metrojet service in the birmingham  al  columbus  oh  milwaukee  wi and st 
louis  mo to washington dulles markets  and has announced its intention to withdraw metrojet service between raleigh durham and washington dulles 
metrojet competed directly with the company in the columbus  oh and raleigh durham to washington dulles markets 
further  us airways has announced its intention to withdraw hourly shuttle service in the boston and laguardia to washington dulles markets and to replace both with less frequent service using a combination of mainline and us airways express regional jet service 
the company competes directly with us airways in the laguardia washington dulles market 
by march us airways express had ceased service in the indianapolis to washington dulles market a market the company serves with regional jets 
while increased competition in the company s markets has had a negative effect on yields  the company continues to take measures to reduce the overall effect on the company s results of operations 
the company continually monitors and responds to the effects competition has on its routes  fares and frequencies  and believes it can continue to compete effectively 
congress recently passed and the president is expected to sign into law legislation that will allow airlines to provide additional service with regional jet aircraft at certain slot restricted airports including chicago o hare and new york laguardia 
whereas previously slot restrictions limited the amount of service that could be provided from these airports  the new legislation  if and when enacted  will allow substantial additional service to certain qualifying cities 
the company is one of several regional carriers that will be in a position to provide additional service at these cities with regional jet aircraft 
this legislation adds significantly to the number of potential regional jet opportunities available to both the united express and delta connection operations and to the company s competitors 
it will also provide increased competitive situations at these airports  the effect of which cannot be determined at this time 
during the company will continue to assess and respond to competitive opportunities as they may develop as a result of this legislation 
fuel price increases in the second half of and to date in have had a material impact on cost of operations throughout the airline industry 
the company s results will continue to be affected by fuel price volatility 
during  the effect of fuel price increases on the company s results was mitigated by the company s having hedged approximately of its fuel requirements for the year 
these hedges generally settled at favorable prices relative to the market price at the time of settlement  which resulted in a reduced fuel expense relative to market rates 
for  the company entered into hedges in late  settling in the second and third quarter of  for an estimated of its estimated total fuel requirements 
the company is also not exposed to fuel price volatility for an additional of its estimated fuel requirements because the cost of this fuel  to be utilized in the acjet operations  will be passed through to delta under the fee per departure structure 
the company s crj fleet is comprised of new aircraft  with an average age of one and one half years 
since maintenance expense on new aircraft is lower in the early years of operation due to manufacturers warranties and the generally lower failure rates of major components  the company s maintenance expense for crj aircraft will increase in future periods 
during the third quarter of  the company executed a seven year engine services agreement with ge engine services  inc ge covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of aca s cf b jet engines operated on crjs already delivered or on order for the united express operation 
under the terms of the agreement  the company pays a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis to ge and ge assumes the responsibility to repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the company  subject to certain exclusions 
the company expenses the amount due based on the monthly rates stipulated in the agreement  as engine hours are flown 
the company s future maintenance expense on crj engines covered under the new agreement will escalate based on contractual rate increases  intended to match the timing of actual maintenance events that are due pursuant to the terms 
based on the contractual rates  unit maintenance costs recognized on these crj engines during will be greater than those recorded historically 
the company has signed a similar agreement covering up to frjs with the frj engine manufacturer  and also anticipates signing a similar agreement for the remaining crj on firm order and frj aircraft on conditional order 
in  the company commenced a replacement project of its computer software systems

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and all hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness 
for derivatives that qualify as effective hedges  the change in fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects earnings 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments  or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument  the change in fair value will affect current period earnings 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
which defers the effective date of statement no 
by one year 
therefore  the company will adopt statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk results from changes in jet fuel pricing and in interest rates 
for  the company has hedged a portion of its exposure to jet fuel price fluctuations by entering into commodity swap contracts for approximately of its estimated fuel requirements for the united express program 
the swap contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of jet fuel 
in addition  delta air lines  inc bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations for the fuel requirements of the company s delta connection program 
taking this into account  based on the company s projected fuel consumption for the year  a one cent increase in the average annual price per gallon of jet fuel would increase the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately  the company s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to the company s commitment to acquire regional jets 
the company has entered into put and call contracts designed to limit the company s exposure to interest rate changes until permanent financing is secured upon delivery of the bombardier regional jet aircraft 
at december  the company had three swap contracts outstanding related to the delivery of the next three crjs 
a one percentage point decrease in interest rates from the company s call contracts would increase the company s annual aircraft lease or ownership costs associated with these contracts by  as of march   the company has firm commitments to purchase additional jet aircraft 
the company expects to finance these commitments using a combination of debt and leveraged leases
