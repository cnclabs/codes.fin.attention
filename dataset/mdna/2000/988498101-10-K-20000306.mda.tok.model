item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction tricon global restaurants  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as tricon or the company is comprised of the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell the core business es and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
separately  each brand ranks in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units 
our  plus international units make us the second largest qsr company outside the united states 
throughout management discussion and analysis md a  we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of our accounting and human resources policy changes in collectively  the accounting changes  facility actions net gain and unusual items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions 
we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance 
ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
in  our international business accounted for of system sales  of total revenues and of operating profit before unallocated and corporate expenses  gains and losses from foreign exchange  accounting changes  facility actions net gain and unusual items 
we anticipate that  despite the inherent risks and generally higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations  we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 
tricon became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of this md a  we include the worldwide operations of our core businesses and  through their respective dates of disposal in  our us non core businesses 
these non core businesses consist of california pizza kitchen  chevys mexican restaurant  d angelo s sandwich shops  east side mario s and hot n now collectively the non core businesses 
where significant to the discussion  we separately identify the impact of the non core businesses 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages and the cautionary statements on page all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as specifically identified 
factors affecting comparability of results to fourth quarter charge in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million unusual charge million after tax 
the charge included estimates for costs of closing stores  primarily at pizza hut and internationally  reduction to fair market value  less costs to sell  of the carrying amounts of certain restaurants we intended to refranchise  impairment of certain restaurants intended to be used in the business  impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates to be retained  and costs of related personnel reductions 
during and  we continued to re evaluate our prior estimates of the fair market value of units to be refranchised or closed and other liabilities arising from the charge 
in  we made favorable adjustments of million million after tax and million million after tax included in facility actions net gain and unusual items  respectively 
these adjustments related to lower than expected losses from stores disposed of  decisions to retain stores originally expected to be disposed of and changes in estimated costs 
in  favorable adjustments of million million after tax and million million after tax were included in facility actions net gain and unusual items  respectively 
these adjustments primarily related to decisions to retain certain stores originally expected to be disposed of  lower than expected losses from stores disposed of and favorable lease settlements with certain lessors related to stores closed 
at december   we had completed the actions covered by the charge 
see note for a detailed analysis of the fourth quarter charge  which includes a roll forward of the asset valuation allowances and liabilities 
our ongoing operating profit includes benefits from the suspension of depreciation and amortization of approximately million million after tax and million million after tax in and  respectively  for stores held for disposal 
the relatively short term benefits from depreciation and amortization suspension related to stores that were operating at the end of the respective periods ceased when the stores were refranchised  closed or a subsequent decision was made to retain the stores 
unusual items we had unusual items of million million after tax  million million after tax and million million after tax in  and  respectively 
see note for a detailed discussion of our unusual items 
store portfolio perspectives for the last several years  we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
this portfolio balancing activity has reduced  and will continue to reduce  our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales as a key performance measure 
we expect that the loss of restaurant level profits from the disposal of these stores will be largely mitigated by increased franchise fees from stores refranchised  lower field general and administrative expenses and reduced interest costs due to the reduction of debt from the after tax cash proceeds from our refranchising activities 
we currently expect to refranchise approximately to restaurants in compared to over  in however  if market conditions are favorable  we may sell more restaurants than the current forecast 
as a result of this decline  we estimate that our refranchising gains will be significantly less than our gains 
in addition  we expect the impact of refranchising gains to be even less significant over time as we approach our target of approximately percent company ownership of the total system 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities for the last five years total number of units refranchised     refranchising proceeds  pre tax  refranchising net gain  pre tax  a b c a includes favorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge of million 
b includes unfavorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge of million 
c includes a fourth quarter charge of million 
in addition to our refranchising program  we have been closing restaurants over the past several years 
restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants  restaurants that are relocated to a new site within the same trade area or us pizza hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine in traditional store which has been remodeled to provide dine in  carry out and delivery services within the same trade area

our overall company ownership percentage of total system units was at december   a decline of percentage points from year end and percentage points from year end the portfolio effect on ongoing operating profit included in our discussions of results of operations represents the estimated impact on revenue  restaurant margin  general and administrative expenses and operating profit related to our refranchising and store closure initiatives described above 
results of operations our spin off in  the impacts of our facility actions over the last three years  our fourth quarter charge and the impacts of the disposal of our non core businesses represent significant items which complicate year over year comparisons 
prior to october   our historical financial statements were impacted by our lack of history as an independent  publicly owned company 
the amounts for certain items  specifically general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes  included in our historical reported results for periods prior to the spin off  include allocations or computations which are not indicative of the amounts we would have incurred if we had been an independent  publicly owned company during all periods presented 
see note comparative information is also impacted by the operations of and disposal charges related to our non core businesses in these disposal charges included an estimated provision for all expected future liabilities associated with the disposal of our non core businesses 
we were required to retain these liabilities as part of the spin off 
our best estimates of all such liabilities have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see note actual amounts incurred may ultimately differ from these estimates 
however  we believe the amounts  if any  in excess of our previously recorded liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flow

in  upon adoption of the sec s interpretation of sfas  we also began to perform impairment evaluations when we expect to actually close a store beyond the quarter in which our closure decision is made 
this change resulted in additional impairment charges of million in and million in under our prior accounting policy  these impairment charges would have been included in store closure costs

worldwide interest expense  net external debt pepsico allocation interest expense interest income interest expense  net our net interest expense decreased approximately million in the decline was primarily due to the reduction of debt through use of after tax cash proceeds from our refranchising activities and cash from operations 
in  our net interest expense decreased approximately million 
the decline was due to an increase in interest income  partially offset by a slight increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was driven by higher average international investment balances 
the slight increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances 
prior to the spin off in the fourth quarter of  our operations were financed through operating cash flows  proceeds from refranchising activities and investment by and advances from pepsico 
at the spin off date  we borrowed billion under a bank credit agreement to replace the financing previously provided by pepsico and  additionally  to fund a dividend to pepsico 
see notes and for periods prior to the spin off  our interest expense included pepsico s allocation of its interest expense pepsico s weighted average interest rate applied to the average balance of investments by and advances from pepsico and interest on our external debt  including capital leases 
we believe such allocated interest expense is not indicative of the interest expense that we would have incurred as an independent  publicly owned company

the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a one time favorable international benefit in mexico

this will allow us to reduce future cash tax payments in mexico

the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to prior years 
the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations varied from year to year but in each year was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate 
this was primarily due to foreign tax rate differentials  including foreign withholding tax paid without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for us income tax purposes and losses of foreign operations for which no tax benefit could be currently recognized

the favorable impact of these items was partially offset by the net negative impact of the portfolio effect  which was approximately million or approximately of operating profit in lower franchise and license fees  net of fees from units acquired from us  also unfavorably impacted ongoing operating profit 
ongoing operating profit in included benefits related to our fourth quarter charge of approximately million  of which million related to the suspension of depreciation and amortization for the stores included in the charge 
these benefits were fully offset by the decline in asia operating profit and year spending 
consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in net income before facility actions and all other non cash charges increased million from million to million  despite the net decline of  company restaurants 
this decline was primarily due to our portfolio activities during the year 
portfolio activities also contributed to the decline of million in our operating working capital deficit due primarily to a reduction in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
our operating working capital deficit  which excludes cash  short term investments and short term borrowings  is typical of restaurant operations where the majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers for food and supply inventories carry longer payment terms  generally from days 
the decline in accounts payable was a result of the reduction in the number of our restaurants and timing in the payment of liabilities 
other current liabilities declined primarily due to lower vacation accruals due to the change in vacation policy described in note  lower casualty loss reserves based on our independent actuary s valuation  lower advertising accruals and lower accrued interest due to the reduction in debt 
as expected  the refranchising of our restaurants and the related increase in franchised units have caused accounts receivable for franchise fees to increase 
in  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
cash used for working capital was million for compared to cash provided by working capital of million in the use was primarily due to an increase in current deferred tax assets and reduced income taxes payable 
excluding net changes in working capital  net income before facility actions and all other non cash charges was essentially unchanged despite the net decline of over  company restaurants 
the decline was driven by our portfolio activities 
cash provided by investing activities increased million to million in the majority of the increase is due to higher gross refranchising proceeds and proceeds from the sale of international short term investments in connection with a planned tax efficient repatriation to the us we look at refranchising proceeds on an after tax basis 
we define after tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities related to the units refranchised  primarily accounts payable and property taxes  and payment of taxes on the gains 
this use of proceeds reduces our normal working capital deficit as more fully discussed above 
the after tax proceeds are available to pay down debt or repurchase shares 
the estimated after tax proceeds from refranchising of million in increased approximately compared to prior year 
this increase is due to the increased number of units refranchised as well as the mix of units sold and the level of taxable gains from each refranchising 
in  net cash provided by investing activities decreased million to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the prior year sale of the non core businesses partly offset by increased proceeds from refranchising and the sales of property  plant and equipment 
capital spending decreased by million or 
net cash used for financing activities was essentially unchanged at billion in payments on our unsecured term loan facility and our unsecured revolving credit facility totaled billion 
in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
through december   million shares were repurchased under this program at a cost of million 
we have repurchased approximately million additional shares for approximately million through february  in  net cash used for financing activities of billion decreased slightly compared to the use represents net debt repayments 
during  we issued unsecured notes resulting in proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used to reduce existing borrowings under our unsecured term loan facility and unsecured revolving credit facility 
financing activities our primary bank credit agreement  as amended in march  is currently comprised of a senior  unsecured term loan facility and a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively referred to as the credit facilities which mature on october  at december   we had approximately million outstanding under the term loan facility and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding under our term loan facility and revolving credit facility are expected to fluctuate from time to time  but term loan facility reductions cannot be reborrowed 
at december   we had unused revolving credit facility borrowings available aggregating billion  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
we believe that we will be able to replace or refinance our credit facilities with another form of borrowing including a new credit facility or publicly issued debt  depending on market conditions or terms available at that time 
we currently believe we will be able to replace or refinance the credit facilities prior to the maturity date 
this substantial indebtedness subjects us to significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations  which are limited in the near term  to prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on the credit facilities is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin as defined in the credit agreement 
therefore  our future borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility in libor 
we currently mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk through the use of financial instruments 
see notes and and our market risk discussion for further discussions of our interest rate risk 
we anticipate that our combined cash flow from operating and refranchising activities will be lower than levels primarily because of our expectations of reduced refranchising activity 
however  we believe it will be sufficient to support our expected capital spending and still allow us to make required debt repayments and buy back shares under our current stock repurchase program 
consolidated financial condition assets decreased million or to billion at year end this decrease is primarily attributable to the portfolio effect and a decrease in cash and short term investments 
the decrease in cash and short term investments was primarily driven by initiatives which allowed us to repatriate million of cash to the us from foreign countries at minimal tax cost 
we continue to look for opportunities to tax efficiently repatriate cash generated from foreign operations 
liabilities decreased billion or to billion primarily due to net debt repayments 
our operating working capital deficit declined to million at year end from million at year end  primarily reflecting the portfolio effect 
other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact ongoing operating income comparisons with impact of ameriserve bankruptcy as described in note  on january   ameriserve filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
ameriserve has advised us that it intends to prepare and file with the bankruptcy court a plan of reorganization in the future 
tricon  the purchasing cooperative for the tricon system and key representatives of the tricon franchise community are working closely together to proactively address the bankruptcy situation and develop appropriate contingency plans 
it is our intention to take all actions reasonably necessary and prudent to ensure continued supply of restaurant products and equipment to the tricon system  and to minimize any incremental costs or exposures related to the ameriserve bankruptcy 
the significant actions that we have taken to date are described below 
on february   we and another major ameriserve customer agreed to provide a million interim debtor in possession revolving credit facility the facility to ameriserve 
we initially committed to provide up to million under this facility 
however  we have reached an agreement in principle to assign million of our commitment to a third party  reducing our total commitment under the facility to million 
ameriserve has advised us that it is actively seeking to arrange alternative debtor in possession financing to replace the facility 
in addition to our participation in the facility  to help ensure that our supply chain continues to remain open  we have begun to purchase and take title to supplies directly from suppliers the temporary direct purchase program for use in our restaurants  as well as for resale to our franchisees and licensees who previously purchased supplies from ameriserve 
ameriserve has agreed  for the same fee in effect prior to the bankruptcy filing  to continue to be responsible for distributing the supplies to us and our participating franchisee and licensee restaurants as well as providing ordering  inventory  billing and collection services for us 
to date  this arrangement has been effective in ensuring supplies to our restaurants  and we have not experienced any significant supply interruption 
further  we have commenced contingency planning and believe that we can arrange with an alternative distributor or distributors to meet the needs of the tricon restaurant system if ameriserve is no longer able to adequately service our restaurants or if otherwise permitted by the bankruptcy court 
as in most bankruptcies involving a primary supplier or distributor  the ameriserve bankruptcy poses certain risks and uncertainties to us  as well as to our franchisees that rely on ameriserve to distribute products to their restaurants 
the more significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below 
significant adverse developments in any of these risks or uncertainties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
we expect to incur costs in connection with our temporary direct purchase program  including the cost of additional debt incurred to finance the inventory purchases and to carry the receivables arising from inventory sales 
while we believe that adequate inventory control and collections systems are in place  we may also incur costs related to the possibility of inventory obsolescence and uncollectible receivables from our franchisees 
we expect to mitigate  if not fully offset  these costs through discounts granted by suppliers for prompt payments 
we also expect to incur certain one time unusual costs as a result of the ameriserve bankruptcy  primarily consisting of professional fees 
we intend to continue to work with ameriserve and our suppliers to meet our supply needs while ameriserve seeks to reorganize 
due to the uncertainties surrounding ameriserve s reorganization  we cannot predict the ultimate impact  if any  on our businesses 
there can be no assurance that the facility will be sufficient to meet ameriserve s cash requirements or that we will be able to fully recover the amount advanced under the facility 
there can be no assurance that ameriserve will be successful in arranging replacement debtor in possession financing on satisfactory terms  or that a plan of reorganization for ameriserve will ultimately be confirmed  or if confirmed  what the plan will provide 
additionally  there can be no assurance that ameriserve will be able to maintain our supply line indefinitely without additional financing or at our current contractual rates 
we currently have a multi year contract with ameriserve which is subject to the bankruptcy court procedures during the reorganization process 
as stated above  we believe that we can arrange with an alternative distributor or distributors to meet the needs of the tricon restaurant system if ameriserve is no longer able to adequately service our restaurants or if otherwise permitted by the bankruptcy court 
we could  however  experience some short term delays due to the time required to qualify and contract with  and transition the business to  other distributors 
there can be no assurance that the cost of these alternatives would be at the same rates we currently pay ameriserve 
we believe that we may have a set off or recoupment claim against amounts we owe ameriserve under our distribution contract that would allow us to recover certain costs and damages that we have incurred or may incur as a result of ameriserve s failure to perform its contractual obligations to our restaurants both prior to and after the bankruptcy filing 
while we intend to assert this claim  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
without regard to the final outcome of the ameriserve bankruptcy proceedings  it is our intention to take whatever steps are reasonably required to ensure continued supply of restaurant products and equipment to the tricon system 
to the extent we incur any ongoing incremental costs as a result of the ameriserve bankruptcy or actions related thereto  we intend to mitigate those costs to the maximum extent possible through other reasonable management actions 
impact of new ventures consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets  we entered into agreements in the fourth quarter of to form new ventures during in canada and poland with our largest franchisees in those markets 
we intend to contribute approximately restaurants in canada and restaurants in poland in exchange for an equity interest in each venture 
these units represented approximately of total international company units at december  these interests will be accounted for under the equity method 
we have not yet determined the timing of the formation of these new ventures 
upon formation of these ventures  we will recognize our share of the ventures net income or loss as equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
currently  the results from these restaurants are being consolidated 
the impact of these transactions on operating results will be similar to the portfolio effect of our refranchising activities 
these transactions will result in a decline in our company sales  restaurant margin dollars and general and administrative expenses and an increase in franchise fees 
in addition  because of our retained interest in these ventures  we will recognize our share of the ventures net income or loss 
had these ventures been formed at the beginning of  our international company sales would have declined approximately as compared to the slight increase reported in however  we estimate the overall impact on operating profit would have been favorable due to higher franchise fees and equity income 
change in casualty loss estimates as described in note  we have recorded favorable adjustments to our casualty loss reserves of million in million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter  million in and million in primarily as a result of our independent actuary s changes in its estimate of casualty losses 
the changes were related to previously recorded casualty loss estimates determined by our independent actuary for both the current and prior years in which we retained some risk of loss 
we believe the favorable adjustments are a direct result of our recent investments in safety and security programs to better manage risk at the store level 
we will continue to make adjustments both based on our actuary s periodic valuations as well as whenever there are significant changes in the expected costs of settling large claims not contemplated by the actuary 
due to the inherent volatility of our actuarially determined casualty loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we will experience changes in estimated losses which could be material to our growth in net income in however  we currently expect the magnitude of such estimate changes will be less than those experienced in this expectation is primarily based on indications by our independent actuary that its current loss estimates are based more on the favorable actual loss trends we have achieved in the last few years than the more negative trends we experienced in earlier years 
we believe that  since we record our reserves for casualty losses at a confidence level  we have mitigated the negative impact of adverse development and or volatility 
at december   our reserves for casualty losses were million  compared to million at year end year as previously disclosed  we developed and implemented an enterprise wide plan to prepare our information technology it systems and non information technology systems with embedded technology applications et for the year issue 
we also took actions we believed would mitigate our year risks related to our critical business partners including suppliers  banks  franchisees and other service providers primarily data exchange partners 
we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operating or financial activities caused by a failure of our it et systems or unexpected business problems resulting from year issues 
given the absence of any significant problems to date  we do not expect year issues to have a material adverse effect on tricon s operations or financial results in we currently expect our year plan to cost approximately to million from inception of the planned actions in through we have incurred approximately million of year costs from through december  of which approximately million was incurred during we expect to incur approximately to million to complete all year problem resolution in these costs relate to additional validation of our it et systems and resolution of any year problems or issues that arise during the remainder of we have funded the costs related to our year plan through cash flows from operations 
extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every five or six years 
fiscal year will include a fifty third week in the fourth quarter 
this additional week will have a favorable effect on our operating results for euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted the euro as a common legal currency and fixed conversion rates were established 
from that date through no later than june   participating countries will maintain both legacy currencies and the euro as legal tender 
beginning january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and a transition period of up to six months will begin during which legacy currencies will be removed from circulation 
we have company and franchised businesses in the adopting member countries  which are preparing for the conversion 
expenditures associated with conversion efforts to date have been insignificant 
we currently estimate that our spending over the ensuing three year transition period will be approximately million  related to the conversion in the emu member countries in which we operate stores 
in our form k  we estimated that our spending over the period would be approximately million 
this estimate was reduced in the fourth quarter of to reflect the refranchising of certain equity markets and enhancements made to our existing point of sale pos systems 
approximately of these expenditures relate to capital expenditures for new pos and back of restaurant hardware and software to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
we expect that adoption of the euro by the uk would significantly increase this estimate due to the size of our businesses there relative to our aggregate businesses in the adopting member countries in which we operate 
the pace of ultimate consumer acceptance of and our competitors responses to the euro are currently unknown and may impact our existing plans 
however  we know that  from a competitive perspective  we will be required to assess the impacts of product price transparency  potentially revise product bundling strategies and create euro friendly price points prior to we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses 
although the euro does offer certain benefits to our treasury and procurement activities  these are not currently anticipated to be significant 
we currently anticipate that our suppliers and distributors will continue to invoice us in legacy currencies until late we expect to begin dual pricing in our restaurants in we expect to compensate employees in euros beginning in we believe that the most critical activity regarding the conversion for our businesses is the completion of the rollout of euro ready point of sale equipment and software by the end of our current plans should enable us to be euro compliant prior to the requirements for these changes 
any delays in our ability to complete our plans  or in the ability of our key suppliers to be euro compliant  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
improvement in effective tax rate as discussed on page  we have achieved significant improvements in our effective tax rate etr on ongoing operating profit in both and as a result of several tax planning initiatives and other events 
in  our etr was  an improvement of basis points from and basis points better than we continue to pursue a variety of initiatives designed to further reduce our etr 
the most significant current initiative is to become eligible to claim foreign income tax credits against our us income tax liability on foreign sourced income 
when it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to claim the benefit of foreign tax credits  which is reasonably possible in  it should result in a further improvement in our etr 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
in addition  an immaterial portion of our debt and receivables are denominated in foreign currencies which exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have used derivative financial instruments on a limited basis to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt was not considered significant 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  in addition  the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts would increase approximately million in value to us  and the fair value of our unsecured notes would decrease approximately million 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows
