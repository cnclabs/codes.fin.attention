item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through its approximately branch locations 
management measures operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each branch as an operating segment 
all the branches offer the same services  except that infusion services are not offered in all the geographic markets in which the company operates 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment 
background 
in july  after an evaluation of the business  apria s management adopted a strategic plan designed to improve the company s performance 
the key elements of the strategy are remain in the core businesses  with an increased emphasis on respiratory therapy  withdraw from unprofitable components of the business  including the infusion therapy service line in certain geographic areas  institute a comprehensive cost reduction and capital conservation program  pursue expansion through internal growth and acquisitions  and reexamine the debt and capital structure of the company 
significant actions taken by management since it adopted the strategic plan include the sale of the california component of the infusion therapy service line the infusion sale  the exit of the infusion therapy service line in texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york and the consolidation or closure of certain small branch locations throughout the united states 
other significant actions include the termination of plans to proceed with the capital intensive implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  a significant reduction of corporate and regional labor and general administrative costs and the development of a comprehensive plan to capture cost savings in the areas of purchasing  distribution and inventory management 
further  amendments to apria s credit agreement resulted in  among other items  significant prepayments against its bank loans to reduce long term debt and the ability to complete up to million in acquisitions and repurchase up to million of apria s common stock 
tax benefit 
net income for reflects a tax benefit of million attributable to the release of a previously established valuation allowance 
the recognition of the tax benefit is a non recurring item and while it does not impact cash flow or operating income  it does have the effect of increasing reported net income and net income per common share 
see results of operations income taxes 
results of operations net revenues 
substantially all of apria s revenues are reimbursed by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid and managed care organizations 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required in recording net revenues 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated  and the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
net revenues increased to million in  up from million in the primary reasons for the increase are new contracts with regional and national payors  the acquisition of complementary businesses and price increases in certain managed care agreements 
net revenues increased in despite the third quarter exit from the infusion therapy service line in certain geographic markets  the reduction in medicare reimbursement rates in for home oxygen therapy  and the exit from contractual arrangements that were not meeting minimum profitability standards 
these factors are discussed more fully in the service line sections below 
net revenues for decreased from levels 
a number of factors contributed to the decline  including the reduction in medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy 
further  in june of  apria determined that its strategy to focus on increasing the managed care market share had negatively impacted its financial performance  particularly for infusion therapy  because of significant managed care price compression  difficulties in billing and collecting from managed care organizations and related losses of traditional referral business 
in response to these conditions  management reevaluated its strategies and began efforts to exit certain managed care contracts not meeting minimum profitability thresholds  as well as certain lower margin service lines and began to reemphasize traditional referral based business from sources such as physicians  hospitals  medical groups and home health agencies 
service lines targeted for exit in included medical supplies  women s health and nursing management  which represented annual revenues of approximately million 
some portion of the medical supply and nursing business is continuing due to core service line customer requirements 
through the end of  apria had exited contracted business representing approximately million in annual revenues 
the contract review process continued into resulting in the termination of additional contracts totaling approximately million in annual revenues 
a consequence of the initiatives to exit certain service lines and to exit certain low margin managed care contracts was the loss of related business that apria would have preferred to retain 
in addition to the specific quantifiable reductions to revenue mentioned above  revenues were adversely impacted by various other factors 
in mid apria began a process to explore the feasibility of entering into a transaction such as a sale  merger or recapitalization 
apria entered into an agreement for a recapitalization transaction during the first quarter of which was subsequently terminated 
the entire process created an environment of uncertainty  both within apria and with its customers and business partners 
during this same period there were a number of changes in senior management and to the board of directors  which added to the distraction and raised more uncertainty 
these issues led apria to be characterized in a very negative light in articles appearing in various newspapers and trade journals 
also  during this period of turmoil  apria found it very difficult to attract and retain quality sales personnel  which left many geographic sales territories lacking sufficient coverage to compete effectively 
all of these factors adversely impacted revenues  but attributing dollar amounts to each is not feasible 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in millions respiratory therapy infusion therapy home medical equipment other total net revenues  respiratory therapy 
pursuant to the provisions of the medicare reform act of  the medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy and respiratory drugs were reduced by and  respectively 
this reduction was effective january  and was followed by an additional reduction in reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy that became effective january  the estimated decrease in and revenues and operating income resulting from these reimbursement reductions is approximately million and million  respectively 
also included in the medicare reform act of was a freeze on consumer price index based increases from january  until a provision of the medicare balanced budget refinement act of  which is discussed more fully below  provides some relief from this freeze through limited reimbursement increases in and despite the additional medicare reimbursement rate reduction  respiratory therapy revenues increased by in this increase is largely due to a sales focus on the higher margin respiratory service line and the impact of acquisitions consummated in see liquidity capital resources business combinations 
infusion therapy 
the decrease in infusion therapy revenues in as compared to is directly attributable to the exit of the infusion service line in selected areas 
the exit reduced revenues by approximately million 
the infusion line in was also impacted by the termination of low margin contracts 
these decreases were offset somewhat by growth in the remaining geographic areas in which apria engages in the infusion business 
the decrease in infusion therapy revenues in  as compared to  is primarily due to the termination of unprofitable contracts and formidable competition at the local and national levels 
also impacting infusion therapy revenues was the exit of the infusion service line in certain geographic markets 
the decision was made at the end of the third quarter of and the transition out of the service line in substantially all of the selected areas took place in the fourth quarter of the impact on revenues during the transition period was a reduction of approximately million 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues decreased by in when compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the sales focus on the higher margin respiratory therapy service line  the contract review process and to  a lesser extent  decreases in the medical supply and nursing lines that apria began exiting in late home medical equipment other revenues decreased significantly in as compared to the primary causes were due to discontinuing the medical supply  women s health and nursing management service lines and terminating unprofitable contracts 
further  the termination of contracts or loss of business in the respiratory and infusion therapy lines resulted in the loss of collateral business within the home medical equipment other line 
the consumer price index based medicare reimbursement issues discussed above are also applicable to the home medical equipment other line 
revenue adjustments 
due to the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services and or from certain payors  adjustments to billed amounts are fairly common and are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or upon account review 
examples of such revenue adjustments include subsequent changes to estimated revenue amounts or denials for services not covered due to changes in the patient s coverage  failure subsequent to service delivery to obtain written confirmation of authorization or other necessary documentation  and differences in contract prices due to complex contract terms or a biller s lack of familiarity with a contract or payor 
further  increases in average collection periods result in a high level of unidentified revenue adjustments accumulating in accounts receivable 
subsequent to the system conversions and branch consolidations effected in and  apria experienced increasing levels of revenue adjustments 
the related disruptions and employee turnover impeded normal processing and account reviews and resulted in a high rate of billing problems 
although management took a number of steps to address the billing and collection problems  the high levels of revenue adjustments persisted 
due to the existence of unidentified revenue adjustments in accounts receivable  management estimates and records an allowance for such adjustments 
in and  management recorded adjustments to reduce revenues and accounts receivable by million and million  respectively 
in  the level of revenue adjustments decreased significantly from the levels experienced in the last few years and days sales outstanding have been days or fewer for each of the last five quarters  compared to a range of to days during and management is continuing to take a number of steps to further reduce the frequency of revenue adjustments as discussed below 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
medicare reimbursement update 
the medicare balanced budget refinement act of provides apria and the home healthcare industry with some relief from the effects of certain provisions contained in the medicare reform act of among the relief items included in the medicare balanced budget refinement act of that are pertinent to apria is a limited increase in medicare reimbursement for durable medical equipment  supplies and oxygen in and also included is a provision that will delay any reimbursement reductions for home medical equipment that may result from an inherent reasonableness procedure 
further  the medicare balanced budget refinement act of includes a provision that excludes home medical equipment  including oxygen  from changes in payment rules related to products and services provided through home health agencies 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in much of the improvement in is attributable to the continued exit from low profit service lines and contracts and the increase in the share of the higher margin respiratory therapy line relative to total business 
also  improved pricing negotiated for inventory  patient service equipment and related goods improved margins in further  in early  management began implementing standardization initiatives and optimal operating models intended to achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies in the functional areas of purchasing and supply management  inventory management and vehicle fleet and delivery management 
by the end of  the implementation was substantially complete 
gross margin improvement in was also impacted by the following charges recorded at september  and reflected in the gross margins million to settle certain procurement contracts  million to provide for oxygen cylinder losses  million to provide for losses and obsolescence in inventory and patient service equipment and million related to the exit of the infusion service line in selected markets 
despite these charges  apria s gross margin improved in  when compared to this improvement was primarily attributable to eliminating contracts not meeting profitability standards and was realized despite the decrease in revenues due to the medicare reimbursement rate reductions and the third quarter charges listed above 
reflected in apria s gross margins for were charges of million and million recorded in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  to increase the inventory and patient service equipment reserves 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in in the provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of net revenues  is largely attributable to an improvement in the aging of accounts receivable 
this improvement is demonstrated by a decrease in the month average of accounts aged in excess of days from of total accounts receivable in to in  which management believes is due to the process and system improvements it has implemented 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts includes million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts due to a change in management s collection policy  million for specific uncollectible accounts and million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable associated with the infusion sale and other business closures 
in august  management reviewed the historic performance and collectibility of apria s accounts receivable portfolio 
management considered the continued high level of bad debt write offs and reviewed its existing policies and procedures for estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
in response  management decided to change the collection policy and formally shifted the focus of the collection function to the more current balances and assigned the older accounts to outside collection agencies 
management believes this concentration on more current balances limits the amount of receivables that age 
consequently  the accounts that do age will undoubtedly be receivables where collection will be difficult 
with this change in collection policy  management revised its estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts in by increasing the allowance related to balances over days outstanding 
accordingly  management recorded an adjustment in the third quarter of to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts included adjustments of million and million recorded in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the second quarter adjustment was necessary because improvement in the aging of accounts receivable and in collection timing and rates did not meet expectations 
management had expected the impact of the field information system conversions and high turnover among billing and collection personnel to substantially reverse by the middle of however  the dollar amount and percentage of accounts aged over days at may  remained comparable to the december  amount and days sales outstanding had decreased by only five days 
additionally  apria had just changed its business strategy to review its managed care contracts and exit those not meeting profitability standards and to exit unprofitable service lines such as supplies and nursing that were attractive to many managed care customers 
these strategies put apria s relationship with certain of its managed care customers in jeopardy  which when coupled with the company s poor experience in collecting receivables with managed care payors  heightened management s concerns 
due to the managed care issues and the failure to realize the expected increases in collections and improvement in the aging  management increased its allowance estimate for accounts aged over days to provide for write offs of older accounts expected to be taken in the ensuing months 
the adjustment also provided for an increased allowance estimate for accounts aged less than days  necessitated by billing and collection difficulties that continued into early the fourth quarter adjustment resulted primarily from refinements to apria s allowance estimation procedures made in conjunction with management s year end analysis of accounts receivable 
specifically  based on tests of subsequent realization and review of patient billing files at selected billing locations  further increases were made to the percentages applied to apria s accounts receivable aging to estimate allowance amounts 
in addition  due to an increasing tendency for certain managed care payors to accumulate significant amounts of patient balances  a specific review and allowance estimation was performed for payors with large aggregate patient balances 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was  and for   and  respectively 
the improvement in  as compared to is largely attributable to the realization of the benefit for a full year in of various cost reduction measures that were effected in  such as labor force reductions and facility consolidations 
further  as discussed more fully above  the standardization initiatives implemented in in the functional areas of purchasing and supply management and vehicle fleet and delivery management improved the selling  distribution and administrative line 
also contributing to the decrease in selling  distribution and administrative expenses in  as compared to  are the following charges that were recorded in the third quarter of million loss on the infusion sale  million to record certain costs associated with business closures  million in severance  stay bonuses and other employee costs and million in lease liability on vacant facilities due to facility consolidation activities 
the increase in selling  distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue from to is directly attributable to the lower revenue base in actual expenses for decreased million from the previous year 
in response to the reduction in revenues  management took steps to reduce costs  the most significant of which was a reduction in the company s labor force which commenced in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout from september  to december   apria reduced its full time equivalent employees by approximately  the majority of the labor reductions made in resulted from the third quarter reorganization of apria s field operations into geographic regions previously  currently and through the elimination of positions at the company s corporate headquarters 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decreases in and are due to the write off of impaired goodwill of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the resulting reduction in amortization expense was offset slightly by a reduction in the amortization period for infusion related goodwill from years to years as of the beginning of the reduction in amortization expense in was further offset by additional amortization expense that was incurred due to the intangible assets recorded in conjunction with acquisitions effected in see liquidity capital resources business combinations 
impairment of intangible assets 
in  the deterioration in the infusion therapy industry and apria s decision to withdraw from the infusion service line in certain geographic markets served as indicators of potential intangible asset impairment 
other indicators of potential impairment identified by management included the company s depressed common stock price  failure to meet its already lowered financial expectations  the threat of continued medicare reimbursement reductions  government investigations against the company  slower than expected progress in improving its revenue management process  and collection difficulties resulting from reported financial problems within major managed care organizations with which the company does business 
therefore  management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of the company s recorded intangible assets and considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies  and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge of million which was recorded in the third quarter of the charge included a write off of million in intangible assets associated with the exit of the infusion service line in certain areas 
certain conditions  including apria s failure to meet projections and expectations  declining gross margins  recurring operating losses  significant downward adjustment to the company s projections for and a depressed common stock value  were identified by management as indicators of potential intangible asset impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value and amortization periods of recorded intangible assets 
management considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge of million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the impairment evaluation  management reduced the amortization period for goodwill related to acquired infusion therapy businesses from years to years 
the remaining infusion related goodwill is being amortized over the years remaining assuming a year life from date of acquisition 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets were grouped at the branch level  which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent 
a branch location was deemed to be impaired if the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill at the branch 
in estimating future cash flows  management used its best estimates of anticipated operating results over the remaining useful life of the assets where  in the case of the computation  the useful life is the amortization period before giving effect to the reduction in the infusion goodwill from to years 
for those branches identified as impaired  the amount of impairment was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill to the estimated fair value for each branch 
fair value was estimated using a valuation technique based on the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets and internally developed software 
one of the actions taken in was the termination of the project to implement an enterprise resource planning system 
accordingly  apria wrote off related software and other capitalized costs of million in the third quarter of as part of the decision to terminate the enterprise resource planning project  management evaluated its current systems to determine their long term viability in the context of apria s new overall strategic direction 
it was determined that apria was at some risk in continuing to run the infusion billing system on a platform which is no longer supported by the computer industry 
to mitigate the risk  apria is converting the infusion system to an industry supported operating platform 
also  apria effected a number of enhancements to the systems which rendered certain previously developed modules obsolete 
further  pharmacy and branch consolidations and closures rendered a variety of computer equipment obsolete 
due to its age and technological obsolescence  it was deemed to have no future value 
as a result of these actions  apria recorded an impairment charge of million at september  apria also recognized additional asset impairments during of million in conjunction with the exited service lines and million related to other facility closures and consolidations 
during  management reevaluated its current information systems in light of year risks and ongoing operational difficulties and concluded that significant additional costs would be necessary to adequately correct system deficiencies and improve functionality 
accordingly  the decision was made to replace apria s systems  including internally developed software  with a large scale  fully integrated enterprise resource planning system 
a two year development and implementation plan was approved by the board of directors in december the project was subsequently terminated as discussed above 
in light of the evaluation and decisions made during  management reviewed the carrying value of the capitalized software and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the charge included a million reduction to the carrying value of apria s branch information system acis program development costs  an million write off of costs associated with acis implementation and conversion  and a million write off of costs of a specialized telecommunications software program developed for apriadirect  a clinical program that was discontinued in december in connection with management s evaluation of apria s internally developed software  management also conducted a review of the company s computer hardware  including telecommunications equipment 
equipment with a carrying value of million was identified as functionally obsolete or no longer in use and was written off in interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in is directly attributable to the reduction in long term debt  but was offset by higher interest rates incurred on the bank loans as a result of the amended and restated credit agreement that was placed into effect in november primarily due to payments of million made on its long term debt in  apria s cash balances have decreased from million at december  to million at december   which resulted in a decrease in interest income 
the decrease in  when compared to  was also due to lower long term debt levels as offset by higher interest rates 
apria s effective interest rate increased steadily during because the company did not meet the required levels of funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  which was the financial ratio that governed the applicable interest rate margin available to the company 
apria s cash balances increased from million at december  to million at december  the interest income from the accumulated cash reserves helped to mitigate the impact of higher effective interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources long term debt 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for is million  and is primarily attributable to the release of the company s million valuation allowance 
management evaluated the available evidence in determining the realizability of the net deferred tax assets at december  management concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize its net deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  significant weight was given to the company s continued quarterly and annual profitability under new management 
additional positive evidence consisted of the divestiture of unprofitable service lines  the stabilization of reimbursement rates in the current year  and management s ability to develop and achieve internal financial forecasts 
at december   apria had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income taxes of approximately million  expiring in varying amounts in the years through and other net deductible items of approximately million that are expected to be realized in future periods 
management believes that its strategies will result in sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period to utilize apria s nols 
income tax expense for amounted to million  which was primarily state taxes payable on a basis other than  or in addition to  taxable income 
the remaining amount of income tax expense included estimated settlement amounts for in progress state tax audits 
certain of these tax expense items resulted in increases to deferred tax assets for which no benefit was recorded in due to offsetting increases to the valuation allowance 
income tax expense for amounted to million and included million to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to recurring tax losses and lower estimates of future taxable income 
the remaining amount of income tax expense included estimated state taxes payable based on factors other than income  estimated settlement amounts for in progress state tax audits  foreign taxes related to the sale in of apria s equity interest in a united kingdom based company and the settlement amount paid on an examination of apria s federal tax returns for through certain of these tax expense items resulted in increases to deferred tax assets for which no benefit was recorded in due to offsetting increases to the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million as compared to million in and million in in addition to the significant increase in net income in  operating cash flow in compared to was impacted by changes in working capital requirements and expenditures for capitalized patient service equipment 
with the implementation of the new strategy in late  apria experienced consecutive quarter over quarter growth in revenues and increases in net income and ebitda throughout with this growth  apria s working capital needs increased 
in  operating assets and liabilities had a net increase of million  compared to a net decrease of million in purchases of capitalized patient service equipment increased by million in compared to to support growth in the respiratory therapy patient base 
the primary reasons for the improvement in operating cash flow in  as compared to  was the decrease in accounts receivable as compared to a significant increase in also contributing to the increase in operating cash flow was a reduction in net purchases of patient service equipment over levels and the fact that less cash was used in due to the timing of payments against accounts payable 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million during the increase is largely attributable to a trend of quarter over quarter revenue increases that began in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout all of also  cash collected was of net revenues in  down from in and days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues was days at december  compared to days at december other accounts receivable indicators monitored by management show improvement in when compared to recent years 
as indicated above in results of operations provision for doubtful accounts  the month average of accounts aged in excess of days as a percentage of total accounts receivable decreased in when compared to write offs of accounts receivable totaled million in  down from million written off in despite the improvements in accounts receivables in  collection of its accounts receivables remains one of apria s biggest challenges 
two factors impacting the performance of accounts receivable are continued high turnover among accounts receivable personnel in many of apria s locations and the inability to collect contractually due receivables from certain large managed care payors on a timely basis  or at all 
historical issues 
in   and apria recorded significant charges to increase its allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments due to problems originating with the abbey homedco merger 
the merger resulted in a restructuring plan that included a very rapid consolidation of operating locations and the conversion of all locations to standardized information systems 
during the last six months of  over  employees were terminated and over branch locations were closed or consolidated with other branches 
beginning with the consummation of the merger  each branch information system was first converted to the predominant system in place within its region 
conversion of the branches to the standard  company wide systems then occurred on a region by region basis 
because of the conversion to interim systems prior to final conversion  locations representing approximately of apria s net revenues underwent conversion 
ultimately  a total of system conversions were completed  were completed during and during the first three quarters of the disruptions caused by the branch consolidations and systems conversions had a major impact on the functions of order taking  product delivery  billing and collections 
existing employees challenged with learning new systems and high turnover during this period created serious training issues 
further  familiarity with the complex and payor specific billing requirements is critical to ensure proper and timely billing and collections 
much of this expertise was lost due to the high turnover among billing and collection personnel 
improvement actions 
in response to these problems and the resulting high rates of bad debt write offs and revenue adjustments  management instituted a number of measures in and designed to help resolve the billing and collection difficulties 
subsequent to their implementation  improvements were noted in several receivables related statistics 
however  management recognized that many problems still persisted  and therefore  instituted further improvement measures 
during the first quarter of  management reorganized its field operations to create a separate revenue management organization which encompasses the functions of order taking  patient qualification  documentation coordination  timely filing and prompt follow up 
the revenue management organization reports directly to corporate headquarters and specifically to an executive vice president position 
the organization structure was intended to facilitate improved communications and accountability 
in conjunction with the reorganization  processes and procedures were reviewed to identify additional opportunities for improvement 
as a result  additional personnel were placed in quality assurance positions to help ensure that products and services were billed more accurately and timely and responsibilities were consolidated to allow specifically qualified personnel to support  direct and train the revenue management staff 
task forces were formed to visit the billing centers to ensure compliance with policies and standard procedures 
also  software enhancements to simplify the order intake process were introduced 
apria believes the lower write offs and improved aging in  when compared to recent years  are attributable to its focus on order entry  billing and collections by its centralized revenue management function and to new system improvements and functionality designed to automate and centralize certain processes and to provide more timely error identification 
further  to address the high turnover  management is seeking to upgrade certain of its accounts receivable management positions to gain more stability at that level and to centralize certain functions that require a higher level of expertise and training 
to address collection issues with certain large managed care payors apria is developing centralized processing groups and is designing customized electronic interfaces to facilitate improved communications and electronic order intake and claims adjudication 
in certain cases apria may choose not to renew contracts with payors who do not pay on a timely basis 
apria will also take legal action to enforce its contractual rights  if necessary 
allowance evaluation 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments and further netted by an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect accounts receivable in the financial statements at net realizable value 
bad debt and revenue adjustment allowances are analyzed on a combined basis 
management uses actual write off classifications in conjunction with historical experience and account reviews to determine the appropriate categorization of revenue adjustments and bad debts  both reserved and expensed 
apria s methodology for estimating allowances for uncollectible accounts and providing for the related revenue adjustments and bad debt expense involves an extensive  balanced evaluation of operating statistics  historical realization data and accounts receivable aging trends 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as system conversions  facility consolidations  business combinations  medicare carrier conditions and the extent of contracted business 
finally  specific reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed 
management periodically refines the analysis and allowance estimation process to consider any changes in related policies and procedures and adjusts the combined allowance to reflect its best estimate of the allowance required at each reporting date 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
there is a delay of approximately a day or two  up to several weeks or more in some cases  between the date of service and billing due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
such documentation would include internal records of proof of service and written authorizations from physicians and other referral sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
long term debt 
apria s credit agreement with a syndicate of banks was amended and restated in november of and further amended in january  february  april and october of the november amendment required a million permanent repayment of the loan upon execution 
the remaining indebtedness under the credit agreement was restructured into a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august  pursuant to the april amendment  apria made an additional million payment against the term loan 
term loan principal payments are payable quarterly  in varying amounts  from march  through june  further  from the effective date of the november amended and restated credit agreement to december   and during the first quarter of  apria was subject to prepayment requirements on the term loan based on excess cash flow as defined by the agreement 
the resulting prepayments of million reduced the required amount of the quarterly term loan payment that was due march  to zero 
no additional prepayments based on excess cash flow are required 
the amended and restated credit agreement  as further amended by the four amendments in  allows apria to make acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of up to million effective october  through the maturity date of the agreement 
at march   apria had million remaining on its acquisition allotment 
the agreement  as amended  also provides apria with the ability to repurchase up to million of its common stock through the credit agreement maturity date  subject to annual limitations 
the amended and restated credit agreement permits apria to elect one of two variable rate interest options at the time an advance is made 
the first option is a rate expressed as plus the higher of the federal funds rate plus per annum or the bank of america reference rate 
the second option is a rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional increment of per annum 
the agreement requires payment of commitment fees of on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of apria s assets and the agreement also imposes numerous restrictions  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments  and restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
at december   total borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million  none of which were advanced from the revolving credit facility 
at december   outstanding letters of credit totaled million as reduced from million at december  and credit available under the revolving credit facility was million 
on march   the outstanding letter of credit total was further reduced to million 
under the indenture governing apria s million senior subordinated notes  which mature november   apria must satisfy a to fixed charge coverage ratio test in order to incur most types of additional indebtedness 
at december   apria s fixed charge coverage ratio exceeds the required minimum 
dispositions and business combinations 
during  management performed an extensive profitability study to identify service lines and or geographic markets as potential candidates for exit 
most significant of the decisions arising from the study was the decision to withdraw from the infusion service line in california  texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york 
shortly after apria announced its plans to exit the infusion line in these geographic markets  a buyer emerged for the california locations 
crescent healthcare  inc purchased substantially all the assets and business  excluding accounts receivable  of the california infusion locations 
apria recorded a million loss on the sale in the third quarter of the transition out of the service line in substantially all of the selected areas took place in the fourth quarter of the operations of these infusion locations had revenues of million and million in and  respectively 
gross profits were million and million  respectively  for the same periods 
apria periodically makes acquisitions of complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
the transactions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the accompanying statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the aggregate consideration of the acquisitions that closed during was million cash paid for acquisitions and related contingent consideration was million in 
allocation of the total consideration includes million to intangible assets  million to patient service equipment and million to accounts receivable 
goodwill is being amortized over years and covenants not to compete are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements 
year compliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
date sensitive application software programs and operating systems may recognize a date using as rather than this could result in system failure or miscalculations  which could cause a disruption of operations 
apria s management began the process of evaluating its systems in late and completed the necessary modifications on schedule 
management also identified certain potential risks with external agents such as vendors  payors and suppliers with whom apria conducts business via electronic interface 
testing of the more significant interfaces was completed on schedule 
also  apria faced a potential risk with certain of its patient service equipment items that have microprocessors with date functionality 
management requested and obtained year compliance certification letters from substantially all its primary vendors
